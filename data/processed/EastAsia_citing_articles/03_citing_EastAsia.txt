AB Fifty years ago, the C-4 photosynthetic pathway was first characterized. In the subsequent five decades, much has been learned about C-4 plants, such that it is now possible to place nearly all C-4 species into their respective evolutionary lineages. Sixty-one independent lineages of C-4 photosynthesis are identified, with additional, ancillary C-4 origins possible in 12 of these principal lineages. The lineages produced similar to 8100 C-4 species (5044 grasses, 1322 sedges, and 1777 eudicots). Using midpoints of stem and crown node dates in their respective phylogenies, the oldest and most speciose C-4 lineage is the grass lineage Chloridoideae, estimated to be near 30 million years old. Most C-4 lineages are estimated to be younger than 15 million years. Older C-4 lineages tend to be more speciose, while those younger than 7 million years have <43 species each. To further highlight C-4 photosynthesis for a 50th anniversary snapshot, a Hall of Fame comprised of the 40 most significant C-4 species is presented. Over the next 50 years, preservation of the Earth's C-4 diversity is a concern, largely because of habitat loss due to elevated CO2 effects, invasive species, and expanded agricultural activities. Ironically, some members of the C-4 Hall of Fame are leading threats to the natural C-4 flora due to their association with human activities on landscapes where most C-4 plants occur.

AB Inbreeding depression (reduced fitness of individuals with related parents) has long been a major focus of ecology, evolution, and conservation biology. Despite decades of research, we still have a limited understanding of the strength, underlying genetic mechanisms, and demographic consequences of inbreeding depression in the wild. Studying inbreeding depression in natural populations has been hampered by the inability to precisely measure individual inbreeding. Fortunately, the rapidly increasing availability of high-throughput sequencing data means it is now feasible to measure the inbreeding of any individual with high precision. Here, we review how genomic data are advancing our understanding of inbreeding depression in the wild. Recent results show that individual inbreeding and inbreeding depression can be measured more precisely with genomic data than via traditional pedigree analysis. Additionally, the availability of genomic data has made it possible to pinpoint loci with large effects contributing to inbreeding depression in wild populations, although this will continue to be a challenging task in many study systems due to low statistical power. Now that reliably measuring individual inbreeding is no longer a limitation, a major focus of future studies should be to more accurately quantify effects of inbreeding depression on population growth and viability.

AB Global change drivers are rapidly altering resource availability and biodiversity. While there is consensus that greater biodiversity increases the functioning of ecosystems, the extent to which biodiversity buffers ecosystem productivity in response to changes in resource availability remains unclear. We use data from 16 grassland experiments across North America and Europe that manipulated plant species richness and one of two essential resources-soil nutrients or water-to assess the direction and strength of the interaction between plant diversity and resource alteration on above-ground productivity and net biodiversity, complementarity, and selection effects. Despite strong increases in productivity with nutrient addition and decreases in productivity with drought, we found that resource alterations did not alter biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships. Our results suggest that these relationships are largely determined by increases in cornplementarity effects along plant species richness gradients. Although nutrient addition reduced complementarity effects at high diversity, this appears to be due to high biomass in monocultures under nutrient enrichment. Our results indicate that diversity and the complementarity of species are important regulators of grassland ecosystem productivity, regardless of changes in other drivers of ecosystem function.

AB Community ecology recognises today that local biological communities are not only affected by local biotic interactions and abiotic environmental conditions, but also by regional processes (e.g. dispersal). While much is known about how metacommunities are organised in space in terrestrial, marine and freshwater ecological systems, their temporal variations remain poorly studied. Here, we address the question of the dynamics of metacommunities in highly variable systems, using intermittent rivers (IRs), those rivers which temporarily stop flowing or dry up, as a model system. We first review how habitat heterogeneity in space and time influences metacommunity organisation. Second, we compare the metacommunities in IRs to those in perennial rivers (PRs) and develop the idea that IRs could undergo highly dynamic shifts due to the temporal variability in local and regional community processes. Third, we develop the idea that in IRs, metacommunities of the wet and dry phases of IRs are closely intertwined, thereby increasing even more their respective temporal dynamics. Last, we provide a roadmap to stimulate further conceptual and empirical developments of metacommunity research and identify possible applications for improving the management of IRs and other highly dynamic ecological systems.
   Synthesis Extensive research has examined the importance of local biotic interactions, environmental filtering, and regional processes on community assembly. Movement of organisms between sites, i.e. dispersal, is a major set of processes within this framework. However, subsequent metacommunity organisation also varies over time in ecosystems because habitat characteristics such as configuration and composition continuously shift. Intermittent rivers are an ideal set of systems to examine these ideas because these freshwater systems temporarily cease flowing thereby limiting dispersal events. We proposed the hypothesis that metacommunities in dynamic ecosystems will undergo frequent shifts in structure and composition in response to the temporal variability in environmental filtering and dispersal. In addition to providing a roadmap for developing a more dynamic perspective for community ecology, these framework provides direct insights for the management of intermittent rivers.

AB Mitochondrial (mt) genome data have been proven to be informative for animal phylogenetic studies but may also suffer from systematic errors, due to the effects of accelerated substitution rate and compositional heterogeneity. We analyzed the mt genomes of 25 insect species from the four paraneopteran orders, aiming to better understand how accelerated substitution rate and compositional heterogeneity affect the inferences of the higher-level phylogeny of this diverse group of hemimetabolous insects. We found substantial heterogeneity in base composition and contrasting rates in nucleotide substitution among these paraneopteran insects, which complicate the inference of higher-level phylogeny. The phylogenies inferred with concatenated sequences of mt genes using maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods and homogeneous models failed to recover Psocodea and Hemiptera as monophyletic groups but grouped, instead, the taxa that had accelerated substitution rates together, including Sternorrhyncha (a suborder of Hemiptera), Thysanoptera, Phthiraptera and Liposcelididae (a family of Psocoptera). Bayesian inference with nucleotide sequences and heterogeneous models (CAT and CAT + GTR), however, recovered Psocodea, Thysanoptera and Hemiptera each as a monophyletic group. Within Psocodea, Liposcelididae is more closely related to Phthiraptera than to other species of Psocoptera. Furthermore, Thysanoptera was recovered as the sister group to Hemiptera.

AB Recent molecular surveys have advanced our understanding of the forces shaping the large-scale ecological distribution of microbes in Earth's extreme habitats, such as hot springs and acid mine drainage. However, few investigations have attempted dense spatial analyses of specific sites to resolve the local diversity of these extraordinary organisms and how communities are shaped by the harsh environmental conditions found there. We have applied a 16S rRNA gene-targeted 454 pyrosequencing approach to explore the phylogenetic differentiation among 90 microbial communities from a massive copper tailing impoundment generating acidic drainage and coupled these variations in community composition with geochemical parameters to reveal ecological interactions in this extreme environment. Our data showed that the overall microbial diversity estimates and relative abundances of most of the dominant lineages were significantly correlated with pH, with the simplest assemblages occurring under extremely acidic conditions and more diverse assemblages associated with neutral pHs. The consistent shifts in community composition along the pH gradient indicated that different taxa were involved in the different acidification stages of the mine tailings. Moreover, the effect of pH in shaping phylogenetic structure within specific lineages was also clearly evident, although the phylogenetic differentiations within the Alphaproteobacteria, Deltaproteobacteria, and Firmicutes were attributed to variations in ferric and ferrous iron concentrations. Application of the microbial assemblage prediction model further supported pH as the major factor driving community structure and demonstrated that several of the major lineages are readily predictable. Together, these results suggest that pH is primarily responsible for structuring whole communities in the extreme and heterogeneous mine tailings, although the diverse microbial taxa may respond differently to various environmental conditions.

AB Carboxylate-releasing cluster roots of Proteaceae play a key role in acquiring phosphorus (P) from ancient nutrient-impoverished soils in Australia. However, cluster roots are also found in Proteaceae on young, P-rich soils in Chile where they allow P acquisition from soils that strongly sorb P.
   Unlike Proteaceae in Australia that tend to proficiently remobilize P from senescent leaves, Chilean Proteaceae produce leaf litter rich in P. Consequently, they may act as ecosystem engineers, providing P for plants without specialized roots to access sorbed P. We propose a similar ecosystem-engineering role for species that release large amounts of carboxylates in other relatively young, strongly P-sorbing substrates, e.g. young acidic volcanic deposits and calcareous dunes. Many of these species also fix atmospheric nitrogen and release nutrient-rich litter, but their role as ecosystem engineers is commonly ascribed only to their diazotrophic nature.
   We propose that the P-mobilizing capacity of Proteaceae on young soils, which contain an abundance of P, but where P is poorly available, in combination with inefficient nutrient remobilization from senescing leaves allows these species to function as ecosystem engineers. We suggest that diazotrophic species that colonize young soils with strong P-sorption potential should be considered for their positive effect on P availability, as well as their widely accepted role in nitrogen fixation. Their P-mobilizing activity possibly also enhances their nitrogen-fixing capacity. These diazotrophic species may therefore facilitate the establishment and growth of species with less-efficient P-uptake strategies on more-developed soils with low P availability through similar mechanisms. We argue that the significance of cluster roots and high carboxylate exudation in the development of young ecosystems is probably far more important than has been envisaged thus far.

AB First generation biofuels provide a number of ecosystem services (e.g., fuel, climate regulation) but they also compromise other ecosystem services (e.g., food, freshwater services) which are of paramount value to human wellbeing. However, this knowledge is fragmented and little is known about how the ecosystem services provided and/or compromised by biofuels link to human wellbeing. In fact, whether biofuels production and use can have a negative or positive impact on the environment and society depends on several interconnected factors. This paper provides a critical review of the drivers, impacts and tradeoffs of biofuel production and use. In particular, it rationalizes the evidence coming from diverse academic disciplines and puts it into perspective by employing the ecosystem services framework popularized by the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA). An outcome of this systematic review is a simplified conceptual framework that illustrates the main trade-offs of biofuel production and use by employing a consistent language grounded on the concepts of ecosystem services. Given the almost complete lack of literature explicitly linking biofuels and ecosystem services, our review concludes by identifying priority research areas on the interface of biofuels, ecosystem services and human wellbeing.

AB Predicting changes in potential habitat for endangered species as a result of global warming requires considering more than future climate conditions; it is also necessary to evaluate biotic associations. Most distribution models predicting species responses to climate change include climate variables and occasionally topographic and edaphic parameters, rarely are biotic interactions included. Here, we incorporate biotic interactions into niche models to predict suitable habitat for species under altered climates. We constructed and evaluated niche models for an endangered butterfly and a threatened bird species, both are habitat specialists restricted to semiarid shrublands of southern California. To incorporate their dependency on shrubs, we first developed climate-based niche models for shrubland vegetation and individual shrub species. We also developed models for the butterfly's larval host plants. Outputs from these models were included in the environmental variable dataset used to create butterfly and bird niche models. For both animal species, abiotic-biotic models outperformed the climate-only model, with climate-only models over-predicting suitable habitat under current climate conditions. We used the climate-only and abiotic-biotic models to calculate amounts of suitable habitat under altered climates and to evaluate species' sensitivities to climate change. We varied temperature (+0.6, +1.7, and +2.8 degrees C) and precipitation (50%, 90%, 100%, 110%, and 150%) relative to current climate averages and within ranges predicted by global climate change models. Suitable habitat for each species was reduced at all levels of temperature increase. Both species were sensitive to precipitation changes, particularly increases. Under altered climates, including biotic variables reduced habitat by 68-100% relative to the climate-only model. To design reserve systems conserving sensitive species under global warming, it is important to consider biotic interactions, particularly for habitat specialists and species with strong dependencies on other species.

AB DNA barcoding seeks to assemble a standardized reference library for DNA-based identification of eukaryotic species. The utility and limitations of this approach need to be tested on well-characterized taxonomic assemblages. Here we provide a comprehensive DNA barcode analysis for North American birds including 643 species representing 93% of the breeding and pelagic avifauna of the USA and Canada. Most (94%) species possess distinct barcode clusters, with average neighbour-joining bootstrap support of 98%. In the remaining 6%, barcode clusters correspond to small sets of closely related species, most of which hybridize regularly. Fifteen (2%) currently recognized species are comprised of two distinct barcode clusters, many of which may represent cryptic species. Intraspecific variation is weakly related to census population size and species age. This study confirms that DNA barcoding can be effectively applied across the geographical and taxonomic expanse of North American birds. The consistent finding of constrained intraspecific mitochondrial variation in this large assemblage of species supports the emerging view that selective sweeps limit mitochondrial diversity.

AB Models of character evolution underpin all phylogeny estimations, thus model adequacy remains a crucial issue for phylogenetics and its many applications. Although progress has been made in selecting appropriate models for phylogeny estimation, there is still concern about their purpose and proper use. How do we interpret models in a phylogenetic context? What are their effects on phylogeny estimation? How can we improve confidence in the models that we choose? That the phylogenetics community is asking such questions denotes an important stage in the use of explicit models. Here, we examine these and other common questions and draw conclusions about how the community is using and choosing models, and where this process will take us next.

AB The last century has seen enormous environmental degradation: many populations are in drastic decline, and their ecosystems have been vastly altered. There is an urgent need to understand the causes of the decline, how the species interact with other components of the environment, and how ecosystem integrity is determined. A brief review of marine systems emphasizes the importance of natural sciences to understanding the systems and finding solutions. These environmental crises coincide with the virtual banishment of natural sciences in academe, which eliminate the opportunity for both young scientists and the general public to learn the fundamentals that help us predict population levels and the responses by complex systems to environmental variation. Science and management demands that complex systems be simplified, but the art of appropriate simplification depends on a basic understanding of the important natural history. It seems unlikely that meaningful conservation and restoration can be accomplished unless we recover the tradition of supporting research in and the teaching of natural history. We must reinstate natural science courses in all our academic institutions to insure that students experience nature first-hand and are instructed in the fundamentals of the natural sciences.

AB Most modern tools that analyze protein evolution allow individual sites to mutate at constant rates over the history of the protein family. However, Walter Fitch observed in the 1970s that, if a protein changes its function, the mutability of individual sites might also change. This observation is captured in the 'non-homogeneous gamma model', which extracts functional information from gene families by examining the different rates at which individual sites evolve. This model has recently been coupled with structural and molecular biology to identify sites that are likely to be involved in changing function within the gene family. Applying this to multiple gene families highlights the widespread divergence of functional behavior among proteins to generate paralogs and orthologs.

AB In recent decades, global temperature has increased at an unprecedented rate. This has been causing rapid environmental shifts that have altered the selective regimes determining the annual organization of birds. In order to assess the potential for adaptive evolution in the timing of autumn migration, we estimated heritabilities of the onset of migratory activity in a southern German blackcap (Sylvia atricapilla) population, Heritabilities (h(2) =0.34-0.45) and coefficients of additive genetic variation (CVA=4.7-5.7) were significant and consistent when estimated by different methods, irrespective of whether they were derived from birds hatched in the wild or bred in captivity In an artificial selection experiment, we selected for later onset of migratory activity, simulating expected natural selection on this trait. We obtained a significant delay in the mean onset of migratory activity by more than one week after two generations of selection. Realized heritability (h(2) = 0.55) was in agreement with expected heritability in the cohort that the selection lille was derived from. Our results suggest that evolutionary changes in the timing of autumn migration may take place over a very short time period and will most probably be unconstrained by the lack of additive genetic variation.

AB The influence of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi on aggregate stability of a semi-arid Indian vertisol was studied in a pot experiment in which Sorghum bicolor (L.) was grown as test plant for 10 weeks. Pasteurized soil inoculated with AM fungi was studied with pasteurized and unpasteurized soils as references. A part of the soil in each pot was placed in nylon mesh bags to separate effects of roots and hyphae. The sorghum plants were planted outside the mesh bags which permitted AM hyphae to enter while excluding roots. Aggregate stability of the soil was determined by wet-sieving and turbidimetric measurements. Development of the AM fungi was quantified as colonized root length and external hyphal length. Soil exposed to growth of roots and hyphae (outside mesh bags) showed aggregates with larger geometric mean diameter (GMD) in pasteurized soil inoculated with AM fungi than in pasteurized uninoculated soil. There was no significant difference in GMD of the inoculated, pasteurized soil and the unpasteurized soil. No significant effects of inoculation or plant growth were found in pasteurized soil exposed to hyphal growth only (inside the mesh bags). However, the unpasteurized soil had significantly higher GMD than the pasteurized soil, irrespective of plants and inoculum. Turbidimetric measurements of soil exposed to roots and hyphae (outside mesh bags) showed the highest aggregate stability for the inoculated pasteurized soil. These results demonstrate that AM fungi contribute to the stabilization of soil aggregates in a vertisol, and that the effect is significant after only one growing season. The effect was associated with both AM hyphae and the stimulation of root growth by AM fungi. The contribution from plant roots and AM hyphae to aggregate stability of different size fractions is discussed.

AB Molecular studies have the potential to shed light on the origin of the animal phyla by providing independent estimates of the divergence times, but have been criticized for failing to account adequately for variation in rate of evolution. A method of dating divergence times from molecular data addresses the criticisms of earlier studies and provides more realistic, but wider, confidence intervals. The data are not compatible with the Cambrian explosion hypothesis as an explanation for the origin of metazoan phyla, and provide additional support for an extended period of Precambrian metazoan diversification.

AB A simple model of photosynthesis in a mature C-3 leaf is described, based on a non-rectangular hyperbola: the model allows the high-light asymptote of that equation (P-max) to respond dynamically to light and nitrogen. This causes the leaf light response equation to acclimate continuously to the current conditions of light and N nutrition, which can vary greatly within a crop canopy, and through a growing season, with important consequences for gross production. Predictions are presented for the dynamics of acclimation, acclimated and non-acclimated photosynthetic rates are compared, and the dependence of leaf properties on light and N availability is explored. There is good correspondence of predictions with experimental results at the leaf level. The model also provides a mechanism for a down regulation of photosynthesis in response to increased carbon dioxide concentrations, whose magnitude will depend on conditions, particularly of nitrogen nutrition.

AB Primary consumers are under strong selection from resource ('bottom-up') and consumer ('top-down') controls, but the relative importance of these selective forces is unknown. We performed a meta-analysis to compare the strength of top-down and bottom-up forces on consumer fitness, considering multiple predictors that can modulate these effects: diet breadth, feeding guild, habitat/environment, type of bottom-up effects, type of top-down effects and how consumer fitness effects are measured. We focused our analyses on the most diverse group of primary consumers, herbivorous insects, and found that in general top-down forces were stronger than bottom-up forces. Notably, chewing, sucking and gall-making herbivores were more affected by top-down than bottom-up forces, top-down forces were stronger than bottom-up in both natural and controlled (cultivated) environments, and parasitoids and predators had equally strong top-down effects on insect herbivores. Future studies should broaden the scope of focal consumers, particularly in understudied terrestrial systems, guilds, taxonomic groups and top-down controls (e.g. pathogens), and test for more complex indirect community interactions. Our results demonstrate the surprising strength of forces exerted by natural enemies on herbivorous insects, and thus the necessity of using a tri-trophic approach when studying insect-plant interactions.

AB Forests and trees throughout the world are increasingly affected by factors related to global change. Expanding international trade has facilitated invasions of numerous insects and pathogens into new regions. Many of these invasions have caused substantial forest damage, economic impacts and losses of ecosystem goods and services provided by trees. Climate change is already affecting the geographic distribution of host trees and their associated insects and pathogens, with anticipated increases in pest impacts by both native and invasive pests. Although climate change will benefit many forest insects, changes in thermal conditions may disrupt evolved life history traits and cause phenological mismatches. Individually, the threats posed to forest ecosystems by invasive pests and climate change are serious. Although interactions between these two drivers and their outcomes are poorly understood and hence difficult to predict, it is clear that the cumulative impacts on forest ecosystems will be exacerbated. Here we introduce and synthesize the information in this special issue of Forestry with articles that illustrate the impacts of invasions of insects and pathogens, climate change, forest management and their interactions, as well as methods to predict, assess and mitigate these impacts. Most of these contributions were presented at the XXIV IUFRO World Congress in 2014.

AB The topics of succession and post-disturbance ecosystem recovery have a long and convoluted history. There is extensive redundancy within this body of theory, which has resulted in confusion, and the links among theories have not been adequately drawn. This review aims to distil the unique ideas from the array of theory related to ecosystem change in response to disturbance. This will help to reduce redundancy, and improve communication and understanding between researchers. We first outline the broad range of concepts that have developed over the past century to describe community change in response to disturbance. The body of work spans overlapping succession concepts presented by Clements in 1916, Egler in 1954, and Connell and Slatyer in 1977. Other theories describing community change include state and transition models, biological legacy theory, and the application of functional traits to predict responses to disturbance. Second, we identify areas of overlap of these theories, in addition to highlighting the conceptual and taxonomic limitations of each. In aligning each of these theories with one another, the limited scope and relative inflexibility of some theories becomes apparent, and redundancy becomes explicit. We identify a set of unique concepts to describe the range of mechanisms driving ecosystem responses to disturbance. We present a schematic model of our proposed synthesis which brings together the range of unique mechanisms that were identified in our review. The model describes five main mechanisms of transition away from a post-disturbance community: (i) pulse events with rapid state shifts; (ii) stochastic community drift; (iii) facilitation; (iv) competition; and (v) the influence of the initial composition of a post-disturbance community. In addition, stabilising processes such as biological legacies, inhibition or continuing disturbance may prevent a transition between community types. Integrating these six mechanisms with the functional trait approach is likely to improve the predictive capacity of disturbance theory. Finally, we complement our discussion of theory with a case study which emphasises that many post-disturbance theories apply simultaneously to the same ecosystem. Using the well-studied mountain ash (Eucalyptus regnans) forests of south-eastern Australia, we illustrate phenomena that align with six of the theories described in our model of rationalised disturbance theory. We encourage further work to improve our schematic model, increase coverage of disturbance-related theory, and to show how the model may link to, or integrate with, other domains of ecological theory.

AB We performed a landscape-scale investigation to compare the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal (AMF) communities between grasslands and farmlands in the farming-pastoral ecotone of northern China. AMF richness and community composition were examined with 454 pyrosequencing. Structural equation modelling (SEM) and multivariate analyses were applied to disentangle the direct and indirect effects (mediated by multiple environmental factors) of land use on AMF. Land use conversion from grassland to farmland significantly reduced AMF richness and extraradical hyphal length density, and these land use types also differed significantly in AMF community composition. SEM showed that the effects of land use on AMF richness and hyphal length density in soil were primarily mediated by available phosphorus and soil structural quality. Soil texture was the strongest predictor of AMF community composition. Soil carbon, nitrogen and soil pH were also significantly correlated with AMF community composition, indicating that these abiotic variables could be responsible for some of the community composition differences among sites. Our study shows that land use has a partly predictable effect on AMF communities across this ecologically relevant area of China, and indicates that high soil phosphorus concentrations and poor soil structure are particularly detrimental to AMF in this fragile ecosystem.

AB Effects of growth light intensity on the temperature dependence of CO2 assimilation rate were studied in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) because growth light intensity alters nitrogen allocation between photosynthetic components. Leaf nitrogen, ribulose 1 center dot 5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) and cytochrome f (cyt f) contents increased with increasing growth light intensity, but the cyt f/Rubisco ratio was unaltered. Mesophyll conductance to CO2 diffusion (g(m)) measured with carbon isotope discrimination increased with growth light intensity but not with measuring light intensity. The responses of CO2 assimilation rate to chloroplast CO2 concentration (C-c ) at different light intensities and temperatures were used to estimate the maximum carboxylation rate of Rubisco (V-cmax) and the chloroplast electron transport rate (J). Maximum electron transport rates were linearly related to cyt f content at any given temperature (e.g. 115 and 179 mu mol electrons mol-1 cyt f s-1 at 25 and 40 degrees C, respectively). The chloroplast CO2 concentration (C-trans) at which the transition from RuBP carboxylation to RuBP regeneration limitation occurred increased with leaf temperature and was independent of growth light intensity, consistent with the constant ratio of cyt f/Rubisco. In tobacco, CO2 assimilation rate at 380 mu mol mol-1 CO2 concentration and high light was limited by RuBP carboxylation above 32 degrees C and by RuBP regeneration below 32 degrees C.

AB In a 13-year grassland biodiversity experiment in Minnesota, USA, we addressed two main questions: What set of ecological mechanisms caused aboveground productivity to become; 340% greater in highly diverse plant mixtures than in the average monoculture? Why did the effect of diversity on productivity become so much stronger through time? Because our grassland system is N limited, we simultaneously measured critical variables associated with the storage and cycling of this element, such as plant and soil N pools, soil N availability, soil N mineralization rates, and plant N-use efficiency, as well as the initial soil N concentration of each diversity plot when the experiment was established in 1994. We used linear and multiple regression analyses to test for potential effects of these variables on aboveground productivity and to address whether and how such variables were in turn affected by plant species diversity and functional composition across years and also at different time intervals within the same year.
   We found that seven variables simultaneously controlled productivity: (1) initial total soil nitrogen (N) of each plot, (2) diversity-dependent increases in total soil N through time, ( 3) soil N mineralization rates, (4) soil nitrate (NO3-) utilization, (5) increases in plant N-use efficiency at greater plant diversity, (6) legume presence, and (7) higher species numbers. The surprising continued significance of higher plant diversity may occur because of its effects on seasonal capture of soil NO3- and moisture and on the accumulation of root-N pools, all of which may have also increased productivity through time at higher species numbers.

AB Satellite-derived sea surface temperatures (SSTs) are increasingly being used as a proxy for water temperature in nearshore marine ecology, but there have been very few evaluations of how accurately SSTs reflect actual temperatures experienced by subtidal organisms. Here, we describe the benthic temperature climatology of 4 coastal locations along a -1000 km latitudinal gradient in ocean temperature in Western Australia (WA), and compare temperature records from in situ loggers at 10 to 12 m depth with records from 2 independent satellite-derived SST datasets over 2 years. Satellite-derived SSTs were significantly correlated with in situ logger data at all locations, which demonstrate their overall ability to detect general patterns of ecological importance. However, SSTs were also significantly different from benthic water temperatures (usually 1 to 2 degrees C higher), and they did not adequately detect ecologically important small-scale variability or provide reliable information on temperature extremes. Furthermore, rank orders of the study locations differed between the methodologies, especially in winter. We emphasize the need to carefully consider whether the accuracy and resolution of satellite-derived SSTs are appropriate for the specific ecological hypothesis being tested in nearshore subtidal habitats, and advocate the use of in situ loggers otherwise. We also highlight the suitability of the WA coastline for experimental work on the effects of temperature (and synergistic factors) on marine organisms.

AB The nose-horned viper (Vipera ammodytes) occurs in a large part of the south-eastern Europe and Asia Minor. Phylogenetic relationships were reconstructed for a total of 59 specimens using sequences from three mitochondrial regions (16S and cytochrome b genes, and control region. totalling 2308 bp). A considerable number of clades were observed within this species, showing a large genetic diversity within the Balkan peninsula. Splitting of the basal clades was evaluated to about 4 million years ago. Genetic results are in contradiction with presently accepted taxonomy based on morphological characters: V a. gregorwallneri and V. a. ruffoi do not display any genetic difference compared with the nominotypic subspecies (V. a. ammodytes), involving that these subspecies can be regarded as synonyms. High genetic divergence in the central part of the Balkan peninsula is not concordant with low morphological differentiation. Finally, the extensive genetic diversity within the Balkan peninsula and the colonisation routes are discussed. (c) 2007 Eisevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Genetic variation is generally considered a prerequisite for adaptation to new environmental conditions. Thus the discovery of genetically depauperate but geographically widespread species is unexpected. We used 12 paternally inherited chloroplast microsatellites to estimate population genetic variation across the full range of an emblematic circum-Mediterranean conifer, stone pine (Pinus pinea L.). The same chloroplast DNA haplotype is fixed in nearly all of the 34 investigated populations. Such a low level of variation is consistent with a previous report of very low levels of diversity at nuclear loci in this species. Stone pine appears to have passed through a severe and prolonged demographic bottleneck, followed by subsequent natural- and human-mediated dispersal across the Mediterranean Basin. No other abundant and widespread plant species has as little genetic diversity as P. pinea at both chloroplast and nuclear markers. However, the species harbors a nonnegligible amount of variation at adaptive traits. Thus a causal relationship between genetic diversity, as measured by marker loci, and the evolutionary precariousness of a species, cannot be taken for granted.

AB No-till management has rapidly increased the cultivated area in Brazil. To control soil acidity in no-till systems, lime is broadcast on the surface without incorporation. The effectiveness of surface application of lime to soils under a no-till system, particularly with regard to subsoil acidity, is uncertain. Crop root growth and grain yield can be affected by chemical modifications in the soil profile due to surface lime application. A 3-year field trial examined the effect of newly and previously surface-applied lime in a long-term no-till system on the root growth and crop yield of corn (Zea mays L.), soybean (Glycine max L. Merrill), and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) on a loamy, kaolinitic, thermic Typic Hapludox in Parana State, Brazil. The experiment consisted of four lime treatments: (i) no lime (control); (ii) liming at 3 t ha(-1) in 2000; (iii) liming at 6 t ha(-1) in 1993; (iv) liming in 1993 and re-liming in 2000. Corn was grown in 2000-2001 and soybeans were grown in 2001-2002 and 2002-2003 without rainfall limitation. Wheat was grown in 2003 with a water deficit during the vegetative stage and soon after flowering.
   Liming in 2000 increased pH and the content of exchangeable Ca2+, and decreased the exchangeable Al3+ level mainly in the surface layer of the soil (0-5 cm). Compared with the no lime control, liming in 1993 ameliorated soil acidity and decreased aluminum toxicity to a 60 cm depth. Liming in 2000 on the previously limed plots compared with the liming in 1993 increased pH to a 10 cm depth about 1 year after application and to a 60 cm depth 3 years after application, indicating that the surface-applied lime in 2000 moved deeper when the topsoil was only slightly acidic. Root length density and grain yields of corn and soybean were not influenced by surface liming treatments. Liming in 2000 on the previously limed plots provided increases >= 100% in length density of wheat roots at 0-10 and 10-20 cm depths, and increased the wheat grain yield by over 2 10%. A soil exchangeable Al3+ level of 3 mmol((+)) dm(-3) was considered critical for wheat root growth. Wheat grain yield was well correlated with root length per soil surface area. The results suggest that aluminum toxicity is low in no-till systems during cropping seasons that have adequate and well-distributed rainfall, but in unfavorable rainfall conditions, the toxicity of aluminum severely compromises root growth and yield.

AB To predict the effect of global warming on plant reproductive success, seed-sets of spring ephemerals were compared between a year of extremely warm spring (2002) and normal years at cool-temperate deciduous forests in northern Japan. The spring of 2002 was the warmest in the last 40 years and most spring-ephemeral plants bloomed 7-17 days earlier than usual. The seed-set of bumblebee-pollinated Corydalis ambigua drastically decreased in 2002 in every population. The small bee-pollinated Gagea lutea also significantly decreased in 2002. However, the seed-sets of two fly pollinated species, Adonis ramosa and Anemone flaccida, were not influenced by early flowering. These results indicat that the effect of global warming on seed production of spring ephemerals differs between species depending on the type of pollinators, and that bee-pollinated species can have serious impacts on reproductive success as a result of climate change.

AB Marine mollusks are among the most important invertebrate fisheries in the world. The main classes of mollusk fished are Cephalopoda, Bivalvia and Gastropoda. Marine gastropods represent approximately 2% of the mollusks fished in the world. Several species of gastropods, such as Haliotis spp., Strombus spp., Busycon spp. and Concholepas concholepas, have high economic value in international markets and play important social roles in small-scale artisanal fisheries. In the past 25 years wild-stock catches of marine gastropods have increased from 75,000 mt in 1979 to 103,000 mt in 1996. During the same period the countries involved in gastropod landings rose from 23 to 47. Gastropods are fished mainly in: (1) the American continent, dominated by the extraction of the muricid "loco", C. concholepas, in Chile and Peru; strombid conchs, Strombus spp., in the Caribbean, and abalone, Haliotis spp., in California and the west coast of the Baja California peninsula; (2) Asia and Oceania, with the dominate abalone fishery, mainly in Australia and New Zealand, and the horned turban snail, Turbo truncatus, in Japan and Korea; (3) in Africa and Europe, the dominate species extracted are Haliotis midae, heavily fished in South Africa, and the common periwinkle, Littorina littorea, and the whelk Buccinum undatum, which are extracted in Europe.
   This review summarizes the fishery of abalone species in California and the west coast of the Baja California peninsula. We highlight overfishing situations and the utilization of adaptive management tools, such as those in operation in Baja California, where small-scale fisher associations (cooperatives) have received exclusive access rights to abalone extraction within specific fishing zones, since 1936. We also review the abalone fishery in Australia, and the use of Individual Transferable Quotas (ITQs) and Total Allowable Commercial Catches (TACC), which have been in use since the mid-1980's. We describe the gastropod fisheries in Chile, mainly C. concholepas, highlighting their economic and social importance. We provide information on the evolution of catches and exports and discuss the development of novel management adaptive tools, such as the implementation of the Benthic Regime for Extraction and Processing (BREP), the introduction of Non-Transferable Individual Quotas (NTIQs) and territorial use rights for benthic fisheries, such as the Management and Exploitation Areas (MEAS). Finally, we present and discuss the necessary steps for the sustainable management of marine gastropods and other benthic resources.

AB The blind use of models of nucleotide substitution in evolutionary analyses is a common practice in the viral community. Typically, a simple model of evolution like the Kimura two-parameter model is used for estimating genetic distances and phylogenies, either because other authors have used it or because it is the default in various phylogenetic packages. Using two statistical approaches to model fitting, hierarchical likelihood ratio tests and the Akaike information criterion, we show that different viral data sets are better explained by different models of evolution. We demonstrate our results with the analysis of HIV-1 sequences from a hierarchy of samples; sequences within individuals, individuals within subtypes, and subtypes within groups. We also examine results for three different gene regions: gag, pol, and env. The Kimura two-parameter model was not selected as the best-fit model for any of these data sets, despite its widespread use in phylogenetic analyses of HIV-1 sequences. Furthermore, the model complexity increased with increasing sequence divergence. Finally, the molecular-clock hypothesis was rejected in most of the data sets analyzed, throwing into question clock-based estimates of divergence times for HIV-1. The importance of models in evolutionary analyses and their repercussions on the derived conclusions are discussed.

AB While there has been a rapidly increasing research effort focused on understanding whether and how composition and richness of species and functional groups may determine ecosystem properties, much remains unknown about how these community attributes affect the dynamic properties of ecosystems. We conducted an experiment in 540 mini-ecosystems in glasshouse conditions, using an experimental design previously shown to be appropriate for testing for functional group richness and composition effects in ecosystems. Artificial communities representing 12 different above-ground community structures were assembled. These included treatments consisting of monoculture and two- and four-species mixtures from a pool of four plant species; each plant species represented a different functional group. Additional treatments included two herbivore species, either singly or in mixture, and with or without top predators. These experimental units were then either subjected to an experimentally imposed disturbance (drought) for 40 d or left undisturbed. Community composition and drought both had important effects on plant productivity and biomass, and on several below-ground chemical and biological properties, including those linked to the functioning of the decomposer subsystem. Many of these compositional effects were due to effects both of plant and of herbivore species. Plant functional group richness also exerted positive effects on plant biomass and productivity, but not on any of the below-ground properties. Above-ground composition also had important effects on the response of below-ground properties to drought and thus influenced ecosystem stability (resistance); effects of composition on drought resistance of above-ground plant response variables and soil chemical properties were weaker and less consistent. Despite the positive effects of plant functional group richness on some ecosystem properties, there was no effect of richness on the resistance of any of the ecosystem properties we considered. Although herbivores had detectable effects on the resistance of some ecosystem properties, there were no effects of the mixed herbivore species treatment on resistance relative to the single species herbivore treatments. Increasing above-ground food chain length from zero to three trophic levels did not have any consistent effect on the stability of ecosystem properties. There was no evidence of either above-ground composition or functional group richness affecting the recovery rate of ecosystem properties from drought and hence ecosystem resilience. Our data collectively point to the role of composition (identity of functional group), but not functional group richness, in determining the stability (resistance to disturbance) of ecosystem properties, and indicates that the nature of the above-ground community can be an important determinant of the consistency of delivery of ecosystem services.

AB Maize (Zea mays L. cv. Tau) plants were grown in a calcareous soil for six weeks in pots having separate compartments for growth of roots and vesicular-arbuscular (VA) mycorrhizal fungal hyphae. Soil was sterilized and either left non-inoculated (sterile treatment), or was inoculated with rhizosphere micro-organisms only (MO-VA) or with rhizosphere micro-organisms together with a VA mycorrhizal fungus [Glomus mosseae (Nicol. & Gerd.) Gerdemann & Trappe (MO + VA)]. Concentrations of Mn in roots and shoots, as well as exchangeable Mn in rhizosphere soil, decreased in the order MO-VA > MO + VA > sterile treatment. In all treatments, the concentration of exchangeable Mn was lower in the rhizosphere soil (0-5 mm distance from the root surface) than in the bulk soil (5-15 or 15-25 mm distance from the root surface). In the rhizosphere soil, the total microbial population was similar in mycorrhizal (MO + VA) and non-mycorrhizal (MO - VA) treatments, but the proportion of Fe- or Mn-reducers was 20- to 30-fold higher in the non-mycorrhizal treatment, suggesting substantial qualitative changes in rhizosphere microbial populations upon root infection with the mycorrhizal fungi. The Mn+IV-reducing potential (net balance between reduction and oxidation) in the rhizosphere soil was also distinctly lower in mycorrhizal treatment compared to non-mycorrhizal treatment.
   In the sterile treatment, low Mn+IV-reducing potential and correspondingly low concentration of exchangeable Mn in soil, compared to the other treatments, indicates the importance of micro-organisms in Mn reduction in soil and acquisition of Mn by plants. Therefore, the lower Mn concentrations in mycorrhizal plants are most probably caused by a shift in composition and activity of rhizosphere micro-organisms. As a side effect of the treatments, improved soil aggregation, as indicated by soil adhering to the nylon net (facing hyphal compartments) after plant harvest, occurred in non-mycorrhizal and sterile treatments but not in the mycorrhizal treatment.

AB Although numerous studies suggest that organic amendments are better at maintaining soil fertility and crop production than mineral-only fertilization, it is unclear if this occurs in different agricultural systems on a global scale. Here we report a comprehensive meta-analysis of 690 independent experiments comparing the performance of organic amendments and mineral-only fertilization on crop yields, the soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (TN) contents, soil nutrient dynamics and biological properties. Our analysis shows that organic amendments increased crop yields on average of 27% than mineral-only fertilization. Farmyard manure (FYM) had the highest effect (49% increase) and this was especially clear in wheat croplands (40% increase). Organic amendment increased the amount of SOC (38%), TN (20%), microbial biomass carbon (MBC; 51%) and microbial biomass nitrogen (MBN; 24%) than mineral-only fertilization. Organic amendments also increased the soil microbiome enzyme activity in terms of soil hydrolytic C acquisition (C-acq; 39%), N acquisition (N-acq; 22%), P acquisition (P-acq; 48%) and oxidative decomposition (OX; 58%). Increased nutrient acquisition and oxidative decomposition could explain the positive effects of organic amendment on crop yields. These observed patterns were consistent for most organic amendments and cropping systems in diverse regions of the world. In summary, our analysis suggests that organic amendments can improve microbe-mediated soil ecosystem functioning, long-term soil fertility and crop productivity, relative to mineral fertilization, on a global scale.

AB Rhizosphere associated microbiota is of the central importance for modulating plant growth and health. To comprehensively understand the genetic principles governing the composition and co-occurrence patterns of the rhizosphere microbiota, the bacterial communities in the rhizospheres of 12 rabbiteye blueberry (RB) cultivars along with their counterparts in the blackberry rhizosphere and bulk soil were characterized to assess the relative influence of edaphic properties and plant cultivars. The composition and network structure of bacterial community were examined using Illumina sequencing of 16S rRNA gene, coupled with co -occurrence networks analysis. The diversity and composition of rhizosphere bacteria community depended more on the interactions with the soil environment (pH and organic carbon) than with the host cultivars. The bacterial assemblages within the blueberry cultivars clearly clustered into three groups (BRI, BRII and RBIII). The bacterial community composition in RBIII, with a higher abundance of Gammaproteobacteria but a lower abundance of Alphaproteobacteria and Actinobacteria, remarkably differed from that in RBI and RBII. Rhizobiales and Pseudomonadaceae predominated in the obtained rhizosphere core microbiota within the plant cultivars. The rhizosphere froth the plant cultivars exerted substantial effects on bacterial association networks and putative keystone species. Intra and inter-phylutn/class co-occurrence in blueberry networks higher than expected by chance was induced by their common ecological niche differentiation or synergistic relationships. Taken together, a comprehensive understanding of the rhizosphere associated bacterial community structure and interaction networks is imperative to elucidate the biological mechanisms guiding bacterial assembly in the rhizosphere.

AB 1. Amazonian droughts are predicted to become increasingly frequent and intense, and the vulnerability of Amazonian trees has become increasingly documented. However, little is known about the physiological mechanisms and the diversity of drought tolerance of tropical trees due to the lack of quantitative measurements.
   2. Leaf water potential at wilting or turgor loss point (pi(tlp)) is a determinant of the tolerance of leaves to drought stress and contributes to plant-level physiological drought tolerance. Recently, it has been demonstrated that leaf osmotic water potential at full hydration (pi(o)) is tightly correlated with pi(tlp). Estimating pi(tlp) from osmometer measurements of pi(o) is much faster than the standard pressure-volume curve approach of pi(tlp) determination. We used this technique to estimate pi(tlp) for 165 trees of 71 species, at three sites within forests in French Guiana. Our data set represents a significant increase in available data for this trait for tropical tree species.
   3. Tropical trees showed a wider range of drought tolerance than previously found in the literature, pi(tlp) ranging from -1.4 to -3.2 MPa. This range likely corresponds in part to adaptation and acclimation to occasionally extreme droughts during the dry season.
   4. Leaf-level drought tolerance varied across species, in agreement with the available published observations of species variation in drought-induced mortality. On average, species with a more negative pi(tlp) (i.e. with greater leaf-level drought tolerance) occurred less frequently across the region than drought-sensitive species.
   5. Across individuals, pi(tlp) correlated positively but weakly with leaf toughness (R-2 = 0.22, P = 0.04) and leaf thickness (R-2 = 0.03, P = 0.03). No correlation was detected with other functional traits (leaf mass per area, leaf area, nitrogen or carbon concentrations, carbon isotope ratio, sapwood density or bark thickness).
   6. The variability in pi(tlp) among species indicates a potential for highly diverse species responses to drought within given forest communities. Given the weak correlations between pi(tlp) and traditionally measured plant functional traits, vegetation models seeking to predict forest response to drought should integrate improved quantification of comparative drought tolerance among tree species.

AB Following widespread deterioration of coastal ecosystems since the 1960s, current environmental policies demand ecosystem recovery and restoration. However, vague definitions of recovery and untested recovery paradigms complicate efficient stewardship of coastal ecosystems. We critically examine definitions of recovery and identify and test the implicit paradigms against well-documented cases studies based on a literature review. The study highlights a need for more careful specification of recovery targets and metrics for assessing recovery in individual ecosystems. Six recovery paradigms were identified and examination of them established that partial (as opposed to full) recovery prevails, that degradation and recovery typically follow different pathways as buffers act to maintain the degraded state, and that recovery trajectories depend on the nature of the pressure as well as the connectivity of ecosystems and can differ between ecosystem components and among ecosystems. A conceptual model illustrates the findings and also indicates how restoration efforts may accelerate the recovery process.

AB The planning of freight transportation activities creates benefits as well as costs. Among those costs, some of them, namely externalities, fall on other people! society that have no direct relevance to the operations of transportation. Such externalities are accrued expenses which should be addressed by actual pricing policies to enable an efficient and sustainable freight transportation system. This paper reviews externalities in quantitative terms, and then provides pricing studies of these costs per unit of freight transported along with the most recent estimations. The associated negative externalities are structured by transportation mode (road, rail, maritime, and air). (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Assessments of anthropogenic impacts on marine wildlife often concentrate on large-scale displacement. However, changes in the activity patterns of animals that do not flee could also affect their energy balance. Increasing boat traffic raises concerns for exposed marine mammals. Understanding risk perception is critical for effective mitigation and management, but it is hard to disentangle the effect of noise, physical presence of boats, and context. We used passive acoustic techniques to quantify how boat disturbance affected bottlenose dolphin foraging activity, and characterized the conditions influencing responses. To account for potential masking effects of boat noise on foraging vocalizations (buzzes), we developed a novel procedure to estimate the relationship between buzz detection probability and noise levels in particular 1/3 octave bands. Bayesian hierarchical modeling was then used to assess the effect of boat presence on buzz occurrence, as well as potential interactions with noise level, location, year, day, hour, dolphin group size, and boat type and number. Our results indicate that boat presence was associated with a short-term 49% reduction in foraging activity, but there was no relationship with noise level. Differences between sites and between years suggested a variable susceptibility depending on foraging conditions. This effect increased for increasing number of boats and depended on boat type. This is the first study conclusively showing that boat physical presence, and not just noise, plays a large role in disturbance. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Understanding long-term, ecosystem-level impacts of climate change is challenging because experimental research frequently focuses on short-term, individual-level impacts in isolation. We address this shortcoming first through an interdisciplinary ensemble of novel experimental techniques to investigate the impacts of 14-month exposure to ocean acidification and warming (OAW) on the physiology, activity, predatory behaviour and susceptibility to predation of an important marine gastropod (Nucella lapillus). We simultaneously estimated the potential impacts of these global drivers on N. lapillus population dynamics and dispersal parameters. We then used these data to parameterize a dynamic bioclimatic envelope model, to investigate the consequences of OAW on the distribution of the species in the wider NE Atlantic region by 2100. The model accounts also for changes in the distribution of resources, suitable habitat and environment simulated by finely resolved biogeochemical models, under three IPCC global emissions scenarios. The experiments showed that temperature had the greatest impact on individual-level responses, while acidification had a similarly important role in the mediation of predatory behaviour and susceptibility to predators. Changes in Nucella predatory behaviour appeared to serve as a strategy to mitigate individual-level impacts of acidification, but the development of this response may be limited in the presence of predators. The model projected significant large-scale changes in the distribution of Nucella by the year 2100 that were exacerbated by rising greenhouse gas emissions. These changes were spatially heterogeneous, as the degree of impact of OAW on the combination of responses considered by the model varied depending on local-environmental conditions and resource availability. Such changes in macro-scale distributions cannot be predicted by investigating individual-level impacts in isolation, or by considering climate stressors separately. Scaling up the results of experimental climate change research requires approaches that account for long-term, multiscale responses to multiple stressors, in an ecosystem context.

AB Marine protected areas (MPAs) have the potential to conserve marine resources as well as provide social and economic benefits to local communities. Yet the percentage of MPAs that might be considered "successful" or effective on ecological and/or socio-economic accounts is debatable. Measurement of biophysical and socio-economic outcome indicators has become de rigeur for examining MPA management effectiveness so that adaptive feedback loops can stimulate new management actions. Scholars and practitioners alike have suggested that more attention should be given to the inputs that are likely to lead to successful MPA outcomes. This paper briefly discusses the potential ecological and socioeconomic outcomes of MPAs then reviews the literature on three categories of inputs - governance, management, and local development - that lead to effective MPAs. In conclusion, the paper presents a novel inputs framework that incorporates indicators for governance, management and development to be used in the design and analysis of MPAs. (C) 2014 The Authors.

AB Subspecies lie at the interface between systematics and population genetics, and represent a unit of biological organization in zoology that is widely used in the disciplines of taxonomy and conservation biology. In this review, we explore the utility of subspecies in relation to their application in systematics and biodiversity conservation, and briefly summarize species concepts and criteria for their diagnosis, particularly from an invertebrate perspective. The subspecies concept was originally conceived as a formal means of documenting geographical variation within species based on morphological characters; however, the utility of subspecies is hampered by inconsistencies by which they are defined conceptually, a lack of objective criteria or properties that serve to delimit their boundaries, and their frequent failure to reflect distinct evolutionary units according to population genetic structure. Moreover, the concept has been applied to populations largely comprising different components of genetic diversity reflecting contrasting evolutionary processes. We recommend that, under the general lineage (unified) species concept, the definition of subspecies be restricted to extant animal groups that comprise evolving populations representing partially isolated lineages of a species that are allopatric, phenotypically distinct, and have at least one fixed diagnosable character state, and that these character differences are (or are assumed to be) correlated with evolutionary independence according to population genetic structure. Phenotypic character types include colour pattern, morphology, and behaviour or ecology. Under these criteria, allopatric subspecies are a type of evolutionarily significant unit within species in that they show both neutral divergence through the effects of genetic drift and adaptive divergence under natural selection, and provide an historical context for identifying biodiversity units for conservation. Conservation of the adaptedness and adaptability of gene pools, however, may require additional approaches. Recent studies of Australian butterflies exemplify these points.

AB Quantifying the relative impacts of top-down vs. bottom-up control of ecosystems remains a controversial issue, with debate often focusing on the perennial question of how predators affect prey densities. To assess predator impacts, we performed a worldwide meta-analysis of field experiments in which the densities of terrestrial vertebrate predators were manipulated and the responses of their terrestrial vertebrate prey were measured. Our results show that predation indeed limits prey populations, as prey densities change substantially after predator manipulations. The main determinant of the result of an experiment was the efficiency of predator manipulation. Positive impacts of predator manipulation appeared to increase with duration of the experiment for non-cyclic prey, while the opposite was true for cyclic prey. In addition, predator manipulation showed a large positive impact on cyclic prey at low prey densities, but had no obvious impact at peak prey densities. As prey population densities generally respond predictably to predator manipulations, we suggest that control of introduced vertebrate predators can be used to effectively conserve and manage native wildlife. However, care should be taken when controlling native predators, especially apex species, owing to their importance as strong interactors and the biodiversity value of their habitats. We discuss gaps in our knowledge of predator-prey relationships and methodological issues related to manipulation experiments. An important guideline for future studies is that adequate monitoring of predator numbers before and during the experiment is the only way to ensure that observed responses in prey populations are actually caused by changes in predation impacts.

AB Ecosystem processes are influenced by weather and climatic perturbations at multiple temporal scales with a large range of amplitudes and phases. Technological advances of automated biometeorological measurements provide the opportunity to apply spectral methods on continuous time series to identify differences in amplitudes and phases and relationships with weather variation. Here we used wavelet coherence analysis to study the temporal covariance between soil CO2 production and soil temperature, soil moisture, and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). Continuous (hourly average) data were acquired over 2 years among three vegetation types in a semiarid mixed temperate forest. We showed that soil temperature and soil moisture influence soil CO2 production differently at multiple periods (e.g. hours, days, weeks, months, years), especially after rain pulse events. Our results provide information about the periodicity of soil CO2 production among vegetation types, and provide insights about processes controlling CO2 production through the study of phase relationships between two time series (e.g. soil CO2 production and PAR). We tested the performance of empirical models of soil CO2 production using the continuous wavelet transform. These models, built around soil temperature and moisture, failed at multiple periods across the measured dates, suggesting that empirical models should include other factors that regulate soil CO2 production at different temporal scales. Our results add a new dimension for the analysis of continuous time series of biometeorological measurements and model testing, which will prove useful for analysis of increasing sensor data obtained by environmental networks.

AB Understanding the economic value of nature and the services it provides to humanity has become increasingly important for local, national, and global policy and decision making. It has become obvious that quantifying and integrating these services into decision making will be crucial for sustainable development. Problems arise in that it is difficult to obtain meaningful values for the goods and services that ecosystems provide and for which there is no formal market. A wide range of ecosystem services fall into this category. Additional problems arise when economic methods are applied inappropriately and when the importance of ecosystem maintenance for human welfare is underestimated. In this article we identify a place for monetary valuation within the pluralistic approach supported by ecological economics and assess progress to date in the application of environmental valuation to ecosystem service provision. We first review definitions of ecosystem services in order to make an operational link to valuation methods. We then discuss the spatially explicit nature of ecosystem services provision and benefits capture. We highlight the importance of valuing marginal changes and the role for macroscale valuation, nonlinearities in service benefits, and the significance of nonconvexities (threshold effects). We also review guidance on valuation studies quality assurance, and discuss the problems inherent in the methodology as exposed by the findings of behavioral economics, as well as with benefits transfer-the most common way valuation studies are applied in the policy process. We argue for a sequential decision support system that can lead to a more integrated and rigorous approach to environmental valuation and biophysical measurement of ecosystem services. This system itself then needs to be encompassed within a more comprehensive multicriteria assessment dialogue and process.

AB Oceania is a diverse region encompassing Australia, Melanesia, Micronesia, New Zealand, and Polynesia, and it contains six of the world's 39 hotspots of diversity. It has a poor record for extinctions, particularly for birds on islands and mammals. Major causes include habitat loss and degradation, invasive species, and overexploitation. We identified six major threatening processes (habitat loss and degradation, invasive species, climate change, overexploitation, pollution, and disease) based on a comprehensive review of the literature and for each developed a set of conservation policies. Many policies reflect the urgent need to deal with the effects of burgeoning human populations (expected to increase significantly in the region) on biodiversity. There is considerable difference in resources for conservation, including people and available scientific information, which are heavily biased toward more developed countries in Oceania. Most scientific publications analyzed for four threats (habitat loss, invasive species, overexploitation, and pollution) are from developed countries: 88.6% of Web of Science publications were from Australia (53.7%), New Zealand (24.3%), and Hawaiian Islands (10.5%). Many island states have limited resources or expertise. Even countries that do (e.g., Australia, New Zealand) have ongoing and emerging significant challenges, particularly with the interactive effects of climate change. Oceania will require the implementation of effective policies for conservation if the region's poor record on extinctions is not to continue.

AB Coral bleaching events constitute compound disturbances often resulting in coral death as well as successive degradation of the reef framework. The 1997/1998 El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) was the most severe on record and affected coral reefs worldwide. The present study examined the response of fish assemblages in plots of transplanted coral before and after the 1998 bleaching. Multidimensional scaling ordinations (MDS) demonstrate significant changes in assemblage composition related to habitat alteration. Within-site variability increased with disturbance, the increase being most apparent following substrate erosion. The differences in long-term responses as opposed to short-term responses were striking. Six mo after coral death, total abundance as well as taxonomic richness had increased at one of the sites, but not the other, whereas 6 yr later, both measures had decreased significantly at both sites. Functional groups, with documented affiliations with coral, were significantly influenced by the habitat alteration. Herbivore abundance increased as an immediate response to bleaching, but was subsequently decimated in eroded habitat. The loss of structural complexity had major detrimental effects on the entire fish community. In conclusion, we present evidence of severe and long-lasting secondary impacts of a catastrophic bleaching event, with no apparent recovery. The discrepancies between short-term and long-term responses underline the importance of long-term monitoring of fish assemblages following habitat alteration.

AB We hypothesized that adventitious roots may improve crop adaptation to low-phosphorus soils by enhancing topsoil foraging. In a tropical field study, phosphorus stress stimulated adventitious rooting in two phosphorus-efficient genotypes of common bean ( Phaseolus vulgaris L.) but not in two phosphorus-inefficient genotypes. Although phosphorus availability had no consistent effects on the length or biomass of whole root systems, it had differential effects on adventitious, basal, and taproots within root systems in a genotype-dependent manner, resulting in increased allocation to adventitious roots in efficient genotypes. Adventitious roots had greater length per unit biomass than other root types, especially under phosphorus stress. Adventitious roots had less construction cost than basal roots, despite having similar tissue nitrogen content. Phosphorus stress reduced lateral root density, and adventitious roots had less lateral root density than basal roots. Lateral roots formed further from the root tip in adventitious roots compared with basal roots, especially under phosphorus stress. Field results were confirmed in controlled environments in solid and liquid media. Stimulation of adventitious rooting by phosphorus stress tended to be greater in wild genotypes than in cultivated genotypes. We propose that adventitious rooting is a useful adaptation to low phosphorus availability, because adventitious roots explore topsoil horizons more efficiently than other root types.

AB Transport to and retention of early-life history stages within the estuarine turbidity maximum (ETM) region may be an important component of recruitment success of the anadromous striped bass Morone saxatilis and the white perch M, americana. This hypothesis was evaluated with spatially resolved surveys of the physical and biological characteristics of the upper Chesapeake Bay estuary during 5 cruises, 3 in May 1998 and 2 in May 1999. Gradients in depth-specific patterns of larval abundance and zooplankton prey were evaluated with respect to salinity, temperature and total suspended solids (TSS). Although physical conditions in the upper estuary differed between cruises and years, the spatial patterns in distribution of larvae and potential prey were consistent and tracked changes in salt front and ETM locations. A statistical analysis suggested that location relative to the ETM explained a significant amount of variability in concentrations of eggs, yolk-sac larvae, and larval prey, and that prey concentrations accounted for a significant amount of variability in concentrations of feeding larvae. Transport to the ETM region probably occurs during the egg (striped bass) and yolk-sac larva (white perch) stages and results in retention of early-stage feeding larvae in a zone of high prey concentrations. Physical conditions in the ETM region differed markedly between a low freshwater-flow year (1999) and a high flow year (1998), and abundances of striped bass and white perch post-yolk-sac larvae were significantly lower in 1999. Recruitment variability was poorly correlated with spawning stock biomass, but spawner-recruitment models that incorporated spring freshwater discharge explained an additional 41 % (striped bass) and 30 % (white perch) of the variability in recruitment. Annual changes in freshwater flow could control larval survival and recruitment by modifying the physical and biological characteristics of the ETM region.

AB Species closely related to model organisms present the opportunity to efficiently apply molecular and functional tools developed by a large research community to taxa with different ecological and evolutionary histories. We complied 42 microsatellite loci that amplify under common conditions in four closely related Arabidopsis: A. thaliana; A. halleri; A. lyrata ssp. lyrata; and A. lyrata ssp. petraea, as well as in one more distantly related crucifer, Arabis drummondii. Variation at these loci is amenable to a diversity of applications including population genetics, phylogeographical analyses, mapping of inter and intraspecific crosses, and recombination mapping. Our analysis of microsatellite variation illustrates significant differences in population genetic parameters among three Arabidopsis species. A population of A. thaliana, an inbreeding annual plant associated with disturbed habitats, was highly monomorphic (P=8% percent polymorphic loci) and only 0.2% heterozygous for 648 locus-by-individual combinations. A population of the self-incompatible perennial herb,A. halleri, was more genetically variable (P=71%) and had an excess of heterozygosity that may reflect a recent population bottleneck associated with human-mediated founder events. A population of the self-incompatible perennial herb,A. lyrata ssp. petraea, was even more genetically variable (P=86%) and appeared to be at mutation-drift equilibrium. Population structure estimated from neutrally evolving loci provides an empirical expectation against which hypotheses of adaptive evolution at functional loci can be tested.

AB Autotrophic respiration may regulate how ecosystem productivity responds to changes in temperature, atmospheric [CO2] and N deposition. Estimates of autotrophic respiration are difficult for forest ecosystems, because of the large amount of biomass, different metabolic rates among tissues, and seasonal variation in respiration rates. We examined spatial and seasonal patterns in autotrophic respiration in a Pinus strobus ecosystem, and hypothesized that seasonal patterns in respiration rates at a common temperature would vary with [N] for fully expanded foliage and fine roots, with photosynthesis for foliage, and with growth for woody tissues (stems, branches, and coarse roots). We also hypothesized that differences in [N] would largely explain differences in maintenance or dormant-season respiration among tissues.
   For April-November, mean respiration at 15degreesC varied from 1.5 to 2.8 mumol kg(-1) s(-1) for fully expanded foliage, 1.7-3.0 for growing foliage, 0.8-1.6 for fine roots, 0.6-1.1 (sapwood) for stems, 0.5-1.8 (sapwood) for branches, and 0.2-1.5 (sapwood) for coarse roots. Growing season variation in respiration for foliage produced the prior year was strongly related to [N] (r(2) = 0.94), but fine root respiration was not related to [N]. For current-year needles, respiration did not covary with [N]. Night-time foliar respiration did not vary in concert with previous-day photosynthesis for either growing or fully expanded needles. Stem growth explained about one-third of the seasonal variation in stem respiration (r(2) = 0.38), and also variation among trees (r(2) = 0.43). We did not determine the cause of seasonal variation in branch and coarse root respiration, but it is unlikely to be directly related to growth, as the pattern of respiration in coarse roots and branches was not synchronized with stem growth. Seasonal variations in temperature-corrected respiration rates were not synchronized among tissues, except foliage and branches. Spatial variability in dormant-season respiration rates was significantly related to tissue N content in foliage (r(2) = 0.67), stems (r(2) = 0.45), coarse roots (r(2) = 0.36), and all tissues combined (r(2) =0.83), but not for fine roots and branches. Per unit N, rates for P. strobus varied from 0.22 to 3.4 mumol molN(-1) s(-1) at 15degreesC, comparable to those found for other conifers. Accurate estimates of annual autotrophic respiration should reflect seasonal and spatial variation in respiration rates of individual tissues.

AB The contribution of changes in meristem behavior to age-related decline in forest productivity is poorly understood. We studied age-related trends in needle morphology and gas exchange in a population of red spruce (Picea rubens Sarg.) growing in a multi-cohort stand where trees ranged from first-year germinants to trees over 150 years old, as well as in grafted scions from these trees. In the field study, age-related trends in foliar morphology were determined in six cohorts ranging in age from 2 to 120 years, and differences in gas exchange characteristics were compared between 60- and 120-year age classes. In a common-rootstock study, scions from trees representing 20-, 60-, and 120-year cohorts were grafted onto juvenile rootstock and maintained for three growing seasons, after which morphological and physiological foliar attributes were evaluated.
   The field study revealed significant age-related trends in foliar morphology, including decreasing specific leaf area, and increasing needle width, projected area, and width/length ratio. Similar trends were apparent in foliage from the grafted scions. Both in situ foliage and shoots of grafted scions from the oldest cohort showed significantly lower photosynthetic rates than their counterparts from younger trees; however, differences in stomatal conductance and internal CO2 concentrations were not significant. These results suggest that: (1) foliage of red spruce exhibits age-related trends in both morphology and physiology; (2) age-related decreases in photosynthetic rates contribute to declining productivity in old red spruce; (3) declines in photosynthetic rates result from nonstomatal limitations; and (4) age-related changes in morphology and physiology are inherent in meristems and persist for at least 3 years in scions grafted to juvenile rootstock.

AB Fitzroya cupressoides (alerce, Cupressaceae) is a large and exceptionally long-lived conifer, endemic to a restricted area of southern Chile and neighbouring areas of Argentina. As a result of its high economic value, the species has been severely exploited for timber, and remnant populations are fragmented and often highly disturbed. The species is thought to have undergone a major range contraction during the last glaciation. In order to assess the extent of genetic variation using DNA markers within and between populations of this species, samples were obtained from throughout the natural range and analysed for random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) variation. Eight 10-mer and three 15-mer primers were used to produce a total of 54 polymorphic bands. Shannon's diversity estimates were calculated to provide an estimate of the degree of variation within each population. Values varied from 0.343 to 0.636 with only the lowest value differing significantly from the others (S-pop = 0.547). This indicated that there is a significant degree of variation within each population, and did not provide evidence for genetic 'bottleneck' effects within the species. A pairwise distance measure calculated from the RAPD data was used as an input for principal coordinate (PCO) and AMOVA analyses. The first three principal coordinates of RAPD distances described 8.3, 5.9 and 5.4% of the total variance, respectively, and a degree of clustering of samples according to their geographical origin was detectable. AMOVA analysis indicated that although most of the variation (85.6%) was found within populations, a significant proportion (P < 0.002) was attributable to differences between populations. An UPGMA dendrogram constructed using Phi(ST) values derived from AMOVA produced a pattern broadly similar to that produced by the PCO, highlighting differences between three main groups of populations within Chile: those from the northern Coastal Range, the southern Coastal Range and Central Depression, and the Andes. Populations from Argentina also emerged as significantly different from those in Chile. These results are interpreted in the context of the postglacial history of the species, and their implications for the development of conservation strategies for Fitzroya are discussed.

AB Mitochondrial (Int) DNA control region sequences were analyzed for 249 Atlantic and Mediterranean loggerhead turtles (Caretta caretta Linnaeus, 1758) to elucidate nesting population structure and phylogeographic patterns. Ten haplotypes were resolved among individuals sampled between 1987 and 1993, from ten major loggerhead nesting areas in the region. Two distinct phylogenetic lineages were distinguished, separated by an average of 5.1% sequence divergence. Haplotype frequency comparisons between pairs of populations showed significant differentiation between most regional nesting aggregates and revealed six demographically independent groups, corresponding to nesting beaches from: (1) North Carolina: South Carolina, Georgia and northeast Florida, USA; (2) southern Florida, USA; (3) northwest Florida, USA; (4) Quintana Roo, Mexico; (5) Bahia, Brazil; and (6) Peloponnesus Island, Greece. The distribution of mtDNA haplotypes is consistent with a natal homing scenario, in which nesting colonies separated by a few hundred kilometers represent isolated reproductive aggregates. However, a strong exception to this pattern was observed in the first group defined by mtDNA data (North Carolina to northeast Florida), which included samples from four nesting locations spread across thousands of kilometers of coastline. These locations were characterized by a single haplotype in 104 out of 105 samples, providing inadequate resolution of population divisions. In view of the subdivisions observed elsewhere, we attribute the lack of differentiation between North Carolina and northeast Florida to recent colonization of these warm temperate coastlines (after the Wisconsin glaciation) not to ongoing gene flow among spatially distinct nesting locations. The relationships among observed haplotypes suggest a biogeographic scenario defined by climate, natal homing, and rare dispersal events. The redefined relationships among nesting aggregations in the western Atlantic region (southeastern USA and adjacent Mexico) prompt a reconsideration of management strategies for nesting populations and corresponding habitats in this region.

AB Phylogenetic relationships among tick subfamilies have been estimated using morphological and molecular characters. However, the phylogeny based on a portion of the 16S mitochondrial rDNA gene differed from the morphologically based phylogeny in a number of important respects, The entire 18S rDNA gene was examined in 18 taxa from all tick subfamilies to test the 16S rDNA based phylogeny. The 18S phylogeny supports the earlier 168 based phylogeny in placing members of Hyalomminae on a common branch with members of the Rhipicephalinae and in indicating long branch lengths among soft tick taxa. However, unlike the 16S phylogeny, Amblyomminae was monophyletic and members of Haemaphysalinae did not arise within Amblyomminae, Argasinae formed a monophyletic group within Argasidae and was not a sister taxon of the hard ticks. In most respects, the phylogeny based on the 18S rDNA gene resembles the morphologically based phylogeny. (C) 1997 Academic Press.

AB Growth, interception of radiation and water use of three genotypes of barley (Beecher, O'Connor and Syrian) and one of wheat (Gutha) were measured on a duplex soil at East Beverley, W.A.  All crops received 11 kg P ha-1 with the seed but no nitrogen fertilizer.
   Growth was initially slow until 69 days after sowing (das) with only small and inconsistent differences between crops.  Thereafter, Beecher and O'Connor grew faster than Syrian and Gutha, maintained growth for longer, and at harvest weighed about 7.5 t ha-1 shoot dry matter, while Syrian and Gutha were about 5.0 t ha-1.  Total root weight and length of Gutha increased until anthesis but reached their maxima at 83 das in all barley crops.  Root weight as a percentage of total plant weight was about 40% during the winter decreasing to about 15% by anthesis.  Root distributions of Beecher and O'Connor were similar but different from those of Syrian and Gutha; the former had up to 25% of the total root length at anthesis below 40 cm, but the latter had only about 5%.
   Dry matter production was linearly related to the amount of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) intercepted, although the relations showed a break at about the time of flag leaf emergence, and efficiencies of conversion of PAR to dry matter were higher prior to this than after.  Efficiencies for the barley crops were similar (about 2 g total dry weight MJ-1 before flag leaf emergence) and about 20% greater than for Gutha.
   Despite the large differences in dry matter production between crops, evapotranspiration (ET) was similar.  For Beecher and O'Connor, evaporation E was about 40% of seasonal ET but for Syrian and Gutha it was about 50%.  Values of water use efficiency (about 30 kg shoot ha-1 mm-1 for Beecher and O'Connor and 20 kg ha-1 mm-1 for Syrian and Gutha) were similar to other cereal crops and the amount of shoot dry matter per unit of water transpired for barley crops grown in W.A., U.K. and Syria was nearly constant; the value of the 'crop specific constant' was 3.0 Pa.

AB In recent years, the use of ecological niche models (ENMs) and species distribution models (SDMs) to explore the patterns and processes behind observed distribution of species has experienced an explosive growth. Although the use of these methods has been less common and more recent in marine ecosystems than in a terrestrial context, they have shown significant increases in use and applications. Herein, we provide a systematic review of 328 articles on marine ENMs and SDMs published between 1990 and 2016, aiming to identify their main applications and the diversity of methodological frameworks in which they are developed, including spatial scale, geographic realm, taxonomic groups assessed, algorithms implemented, and data sources. Of the 328 studies, 48 % were at local scales, with a hotspot of research effort in the North Atlantic Ocean. Most studies were based on correlative approaches and were used to answer ecological or biogeographic questions about mechanisms underlying geographic ranges (64 %). A few attempted to evaluate impacts of climate change (19 %) or to develop strategies for conservation (11 %). Several correlative techniques have been used, but most common was the machine-learning approach Maxent (46 %) and statistical approaches such as generalized additive models GAMS (22 %) and generalized linear models, GLMs (14 %). The groups most studied were fish (23 %), molluscs (16 %), and marine mammals (14 %), the first two with commercial importance and the last important for conservation. We noted a lack of clarity regarding the definitions of ENMs versus SDMs, and a rather consistent failure to differentiate between them. This review exposed a need to know, reduce, and report error and uncertainty associated with species' occurrence records and environmental data. In addition, particular to marine realms, a third dimension should be incorporated into the modelling process, referring to the vertical position of the species, which will improve the precision and utility of these models. So too is of paramount importance the consideration of temporal and spatial resolution of environmental layers to adequately represent the dynamic nature of marine ecosystems, especially in the case of highly mobile species.

AB The number of marine watercraft is on the rise-from private boats in coastal areas to commercial ships crossing oceans. A concomitant increase in underwater noise has been reported in several regions around the globe. Given the important role sound plays in the life functions of marine mammals, research on the potential effects of vessel noise has grown-in particular since the year 2000. We provide an overview of this literature, showing that studies have been patchy in terms of their coverage of species, habitats, vessel types, and types of impact investigated. The documented effects include behavioral and acoustic responses, auditory masking, and stress. We identify knowledge gaps: There appears a bias to more easily accessible species (i.e., bottlenose dolphins and humpback whales), whereas there is a paucity of literature addressing vessel noise impacts on river dolphins, even though some of these species experience chronic noise from boats. Similarly, little is known about the potential effects of ship noise on pelagic and deep-diving marine mammals, even though ship noise is focused in a downward direction, reaching great depth at little acoustic loss and potentially coupling into sound propagation channels in which sound may transmit over long ranges. We explain the fundamental concepts involved in the generation and propagation of vessel noise and point out common problems with both physics and biology: Recordings of ship noise might be affected by unidentified artifacts, and noise exposure can be both under- and over-estimated by tens of decibel if the local sound propagation conditions are not considered. The lack of anthropogenic (e.g., different vessel types), environmental (e.g., different sea states or presence/absence of prey), and biological (e.g., different demographics) controls is a common problem, as is a lack of understanding what constitutes the 'normal' range of behaviors. Last but not least, the biological significance of observed responses is mostly unknown. Moving forward, standards on study design, data analysis, and reporting are badly needed so that results are comparable (across space and time) and so that data can be synthesized to address the grand unknowns: the role of context and the consequences of chronic exposures.

AB Nematode predation has important roles in determining bacterial community composition and dynamics, but the extent of the effects remains largely rudimentary, particularly in natural environment settings. Here, we investigated the complex microbial-microfaunal interactions in the rhizosphere of maize grown in red soils, which were derived from four long-term fertilization regimes. Root-free rhizosphere soil samples were separated into three aggregate fractions whereby the abundance and community composition were examined for nematode and total bacterial communities. A functional group of alkaline phosphomonoesterase (ALP) producing bacteria was included to test the hypothesis that nematode grazing may significantly affect specific bacteria-mediated ecological functions, that is, organic phosphate cycling in soil. Results of correlation analysis, structural equation modeling and interaction networks combined with laboratory microcosm experiments consistently indicated that bacterivorous nematodes enhanced bacterial diversity, and the abundance of bacterivores was positively correlated with bacterial biomass, including ALP-producing bacterial abundance. Significantly, such effects were more pronounced in large macroaggregates than in microaggregates. There was a positive correlation between the most dominant bacterivores Protorhabditis and the ALP-producing keystone 'species' Mesorhizobium. Taken together, these findings implicate important roles of nematodes in stimulating bacterial dynamics in a spatially dependent manner.

AB The maturation of marine phylogeography depends on integration of comparative information across different regions globally. The northwestern Pacific, characterized by unique tectonic setting, however, is still underrepresented. This study seeks to highlight its phylogeographical history based on the available population data, focusing on three seas: the East China Sea (ECS), the South China Sea (SCS) and the Sea of Japan (SOJ). We first conducted a literature survey to evaluate current research efforts and then reanalysed the population structure, historical demography and genealogy for two selections of studies (namely the ECS category' and the multiple-sea category') to elucidate the evolutionary processes within and across the seas, respectively. For the ECS category, the meta-analyses revealed most studies displayed a shallow phylogeny, indicating a single origin from the sea. Significant population structure was commonplace, particularly in molluck and crustacean studies, with proportions of 89% and 80%, respectively. Nearly all studies selected showed signals of population expansion: the times estimated were closely linked to a period of similar to 120-140Kya rather than the last glacial maximum. For the latter category, divergent intraspecific lineages appeared among seas and overlapped in the adjacent regions, a pattern implying each sea had served as an independent refugium during glaciations. The genetic splits, however, were estimated to arise from separate events dating from late Miocene to middle Pleistocene. As phylogeography is still in its infancy in the region, more effort is needed to test and complement the general rules abstracted here. Finally, challenges and prospects were discussed to accelerate further research.

AB Listeria monocytogenes is the causative agent of the food-borne life threatening disease listeriosis. This pathogenic bacterium received much attention in the endeavor of deciphering the cellular mechanisms that underlie the onset of infection and its ability to adapt to the food processing environment. Although information is available on the presence of L. monocytogenes in many environmental niches including soil, water, plants, foodstuff and animals, understanding the ecology of L. monocytogenes in outdoor environments has received less attention. Soil is an environmental niche of pivotal importance in the transmission of this bacterium to plants and animals. Soil composition, microbial communities and macrofauna are extrinsic edaphic factors that direct the fate of L. monocytogenes in the soil environment. Moreover, farming practices may further affect its incidence. The genome of L. monocytogenes presents an extensive repertoire of genes encoding transport proteins and regulators, a characteristic of the genome of ubiquitous bacteria. Postgenomic analyses bring new insights in the process of soil adaptation. In the present paper focussing on soil, we review these extrinsic and intrinsic factors that drive environmental adaptation of L. monocytogenes.

AB The last 20 years have seen a dramatic increase in efforts to mitigate the negative effects of roads and traffic on wildlife, including fencing to prevent wildlife-vehicle collisions and wildlife crossing structures to facilitate landscape connectivity. While not necessarily explicitly articulated, the fundamental drivers behind road mitigation are human safety, animal welfare, and/or wildlife conservation. Concomitant with the increased effort to mitigate has been a focus on evaluating road mitigation. So far, research has mainly focussed on assessing the use of wildlife crossing structures, demonstrating that a broad range of species use them. However, this research has done little to address the question of the effectiveness of crossing structures, because use of a wildlife crossing structure does not necessarily equate to its effectiveness. The paucity of studies directly examining the effectiveness of crossing structures is exacerbated by the fact that such studies are often poorly designed, which limits the level of inference that can be made. Without well performed evaluations of the effectiveness of road mitigation measures, we may endanger the viability of wildlife populations and inefficiently use financial resources by installing structures that are not as effective as we think they are. In this paper we outline the essential elements of a good experimental design for such assessments and prioritize the parameters to be measured. The framework we propose will facilitate collaboration between road agencies and scientists to undertake research programs that fully evaluate effectiveness of road mitigation measures. We discuss the added value of road mitigation evaluations for policy makers and transportation agencies and provide recommendations on how to incorporate such evaluations in road planning practices.

AB The scientific community is working on ways to identify different ecosystem services and to bring them on par to allow tradeoff analysis and inform targeting of policies. However, those ultimately governing ecosystem services continue to base their decisions on traditional knowledge production segregated to specific habitats, ecosystems, geographical areas and sectors. The aim of our paper is to tackle the challenges of the transition from sector governance to a more integrated model of ecosystem service governance by building on existing governance arrangements geared towards sustainability. To examine the uptake of ecosystem service approaches, we review published material and conduct secondary analysis of how ecosystem services are identified, measured, mapped and valued in three Finnish real-world governance settings. The governance settings of voluntary biodiversity conservation, urban planning and natural resource strategies show that, at a qualitative level, identifying a broad range of ecosystem services is easy and appealing but cross-comparison and tradeoff analysis face challenges. The analysis demonstrates that measuring all services is impossible and faces difficulties where the services fall between traditional sectoral boundaries. Measuring and valuing services does not directly lead to increased use of this knowledge. We conclude that the mismatch between the governance needs and the ecosystem service paradigm can be closed only if the tools are developed so that they build on existing knowledge systems and governance arrangements but aim at communicating across ecosystem and sector boundaries.

AB The hyporheic zone is a potential refuge that can promote persistence of benthic invertebrates during adverse conditions in surface streams. For decades, changes in invertebrate depth distribution have been investigated in relation to flood, low flow and drying events, but evidence for use of the hyporheic refuge remains equivocal. This review examines the evidence for the hyporheic zone's refugial role during adverse hydrological conditions. Refuge potential is influenced by determinants in four categories. First, refuge use varies spatially in relation to physical habitat parameters, including sediment porosity and hydrologic exchange. Second, refuge use is temporally variable and reflects disturbance characteristics including rate of onset. Third, refuge use is taxon-specific, depending on a range of morphological, behavioural and physiological traits. Fourth, the behaviours governing refuge use vary, with both active migrations and passive habitat use playing important roles in community persistence. These four determinants interact to influence refuge use; for example, the physical habitat providing an adequate refuge will vary between taxa. Despite this variability, the hyporheic zone is an important component in the suite of refuges that facilitate community resilience to disturbance events. As such, its ecological integrity should be safeguarded through sensitive management and effective rehabilitation schemes.

AB Aim The presence-only data stored in natural history collections is the most important source of information available regarding the distribution of organisms. These data and profile techniques can be used to generate species distribution models (SDMs), but pseudo-absences must be generated to use group discriminative techniques. In this study, we evaluated whether the SDMs generated with pseudo-absences are reliable and also if there are differences in the results obtained with profile and group discriminative techniques.
   Location Ecuador, South America.
   Methods The SDMs were generated with a training data set for each of the five species of Anthurium and six different methods: two profile techniques (BIOCLIM and Gower's distance index), three group discriminative techniques [logistic multiple regression (LMR), multivariate adaptative regression splines (MARS) and MAXENT] and a mixed modelling approach genetic algorithm for rule-set production (GARP), which employs a combination of profile and group discriminative techniques and generates its own pseudo-absences. For LMR, MARS and MAXENT, three types of absences were generated: (1) random pseudo-absences in equal number to presences and excluding a buffer area around presences (except for MAXENT, which assumes that this background sample includes presences), (2) a large number (10,000) of random pseudo-absences, also excluding a buffer area around each presence and (3) 'target-group absences' (TGA), consisting of sites where other species of the group have been collected by the specialist, but not the species being modelled. To compare the predictive performance of the SDMs, the area under the curve statistic was calculated using an independent testing data set for each species.
   Results MARS, MAXENT and LMR produce better results than the profile techniques. The models created with TGA are generally more accurate than those generated with pseudo-absences.
   Main conclusions The advantages and disadvantages of different options for using pseudo-absences and TGA with profile and group discriminative modelling techniques are explained and recommendations are made for the future.

AB Roads can disrupt the population processes of vertebrate wildlife species through habitat fragmentation and vehicle collision. The aims of this review were to synthesise the recent literature on road impacts on wildlife, to identify gaps in our understanding of this topic and to guide future research and management in Australia. We reviewed 244 published studies from the last decade on road and vehicle impacts on wildlife conducted worldwide. A geographic bias was evident among the studies, with 51% conducted in North America, 25% in Europe, 17% in Australia and 7% across several other countries. A taxonomic bias was evident towards mammals (53%), with far fewer studies on birds (10%), amphibians (9%) and reptiles (8%), and some (20%) included multiple taxonomic groups. Although this bias is partly explained by large insurance and medical costs associated with collisions involving large mammals, it is also evident in Australia and signals that large components of biodiversity are being neglected. Despite a prevalence of studies on wildlife road mortality (34%), population impacts are poorly described, although negative impacts are implicated for many species. Barrier effects of roads were examined in 44 studies, with behavioural aversion leading to adverse genetic consequences identified for some species. The installation of road-crossing structures for wildlife has become commonplace worldwide, but has largely outpaced an understanding of any population benefits. Road underpasses appear to be an important generic mitigation tool because a wide range of taxa use them. This knowledge can guide management until further information becomes available. Global concern about the decline of amphibians should lead to a greater focus on road impacts on this group. Priorities for research in Australia include (1) genetic studies on a range of taxa to provide an understanding of life-history traits that predispose species to barrier effects from roads, (2) studies that examine whether crossing structures alleviate population impacts from roads and (3) studies that describe the behavioural response of frogs to crossing structures and that identify factors that may promote the use of suitable structures. A national strategy to mitigate the impacts of roads on wildlife populations is long overdue and must ensure that research on this topic is adequately funded.

AB Populations of the European wildcat (Felis silvestris) are only slowly recovering in Central Europe after a severe decline in the last centuries and require specific conservation plans in many areas. However, detailed information on wildcat occurrence and habitat requirements is still scarce and controversial. We present a fine-scale habitat selection model for wildcats based on detailed species and land use information and evaluate its accuracy to predict habitat distribution in new areas. We analysed habitat use within home ranges using single locations of 12 radio-tracked individuals from south western Germany. Several competing models were fitted and compared using generalised linear mixed models (GLMM) and information-theoretic approaches. Radio-tracking data of 9 and 10 wildcats from two distant areas were used to evaluate the models. The selected model predicted habitat associated to close distance to forest, watercourses and meadows and a critical distance to villages, single houses and roads. To predict area suitable for home ranges we superimposed rules derived from home range attributes at a higher level of selection. Predictions from the combination of the fine-scale habitat model and home range rules matched well with more than 2000 wildcat observations of southwestern Germany. We discuss the application of the model in wildcat conservation for finding potential reintroduction sites, identifying small isolated populations and aiding in the evaluation of the needs of mitigation and compensation within the scope of the European Habitats Directive.

AB Species richness, cover and community structure of reef-building corals were assessed at 599 sites on 135 reefs along the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) between 1994 and 2001, with focus on the nearshore area. Communities were described hierarchically, with smaller regional communities forming part of higher level communities at increasing spatial scales. Site richness increased from the coast to the mid-continental shelf, declining on the outer shelf. Richness also increased with depth to 5 in, stabilizing thereafter. An anomaly was present in a 400 km section adjacent to the northern, 'wet tropics' coast, where site richness was 67 and 41 % lower than the adjacent far northern and central GBR, respectively; this was probably due to the disturbance regime, with an apparent anthropogenic component. Site richness also declined in the Southern GBR, probably due to naturally marginal conditions. All indicator species had highest values in five small Far Northern and Central GBR communities. In the eight depauperate communities no indicator species had high values, indicating that these communities represent degraded, yet potentially transitional forms of the more diverse communities of the Far Northern and Central GBR. The study shows that on the GBR, disturbance results in the local removal of corals rather than a shift to suites of other coral species.

AB The pattern for distribution of genetic variation within and between populations is referred to as the genetic population structure of the species. To avoid depletion of genetic resources sustainable management should be based on knowledge of this structure. We discuss key aspects of genetic population structure in the context of identifying biological units for fisheries management, suggesting three basic types of structuring: distinct populations; continuous change; and no differentiation. The type of structure determines how units for genetically sustainable management are to be identified. We also review what is currently known regarding the genetic population structure of fishes exploited in the Swedish part of the Baltic Sea, and conclude that sufficient genetic information is lacking for most of the species. This is a serious problem, particularly considering that populations of several commercially exploited fishes are declining and some exhibit recruitment problems. For six species, Atlantic herring, Atlantic salmon, brown trout, European eel, turbot, and pike, sufficient genetic data are available to provide at least basic information on genetic structure and genetic units for biologically sustainable use. Current management practices do not sufficiently consider these data.

AB Aim To explore the environmental correlates of tree species distributions in Catalonia according to the chorological status of the species.
   Location The study area is the region of Catalonia, in north-eastern Spain.
   Methods We used presence-absence data for 24 species, sampled in random plots distributed throughout forests of Catalonia. A climate model for the Catalonia region provided environmental variables. We used classification tree analysis to explore the environmental correlates of the realized niches of tree species. The predictive accuracy of the models was assessed using the ROC curve approach. Potential distribution maps of tree species were generated for the whole Catalonia region.
   Results Models were ranked from low to high accuracy for the 24 species. Differences in accuracy among species were related to the chorological status of species. Zonal species, or species at the core of their range (Mediterranean and Sub-Mediterranean species), were generally well predicted, while extrazonal species, or species at the edge of their range, were predicted only moderately well. Mediterranean species distributions showed good correlations with extreme temperatures and annual precipitation.
   Main conclusions The above trends confirmed the difficulty of identifying the realized niche of species at the edges of their ranges. In contrast, Mediterranean and Sub-Mediterranean species, which were at the core of their range, were well-predicted, confirming the importance of extremes of temperature and annual precipitation as effective surrogates for variables having more direct physiological roles in limiting the ability of plants to survive and grow. Maps of potential tree distributions allowed us to define suitable habitats and to highlight areas where species have been planted outside their natural distribution.

AB 1. Photosynthetic characteristics of an annual herb, Chenopodium album, and an evergreen tree, Quercus myrsinaefolia, were compared to clarify causes of the difference in photosynthetic nitrogen-use efficiency (photosynthetic capacity per unit nitrogen) between leaves of herbaceous and evergreen species.
   2. When leaves with the same nitrogen content on an area basis were compared, photosynthetic capacity of C. album was twice as high as that of Q. myrsinaefolia. Gas-exchange measurements showed higher intercellular CO2 concentration in C. album. Biochemical analyses indicated larger allocation of nitrogen into ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase, a key enzyme of photosynthesis, and higher specific activity of ribulose-l,5-bisphosphate carboxylase in C. album. However, these differences were not large.
   3. Compositional deviation of C-13 in leaves of the two species suggested that the drop of CO2 level between the intercellular space and the chloroplast was slightly larger in Q. myrsinaefolia when compared between the leaves with the same photosynthetic capacity.
   4. It is concluded that the difference in photosynthetic nitrogen-use efficiency between C. album and Q. myrsinaefolia is not caused by a sole factor that is markedly different between the two species but by several factors each of which is slightly disadvantageous to Q. myrsinaefolia compared with C. album.

AB Barley, sorghum, and maize plants were grown in nutrient culture with increasing concentrations of bicarbonate supplied as NaHCO3 (0-20 mM) and harvested at 0, 2, 4, and 8 days of treatment. Bicarbonate induced symptoms of iron (Fe) deficiency (chlorosis) in all three plant species, but sorghum and maize were more sensitive than barley. Increases in the concentration of HCO3-ions in the nutrient medium markedly decreased dry weight of roots and shoots in all three crop species. These effects became more distinct with time, particularly at 10 and 20 mM of bicarbonate supply. In contrast to root dry weight, however, root length was depressed by bicarbonate to a lesser extent in barley than in sorghum and maize. In all three species bicarbonate supply resulted in an accumulation of organic acids in roots and a decline in uptake and translocation of Fe. In addition, inhibition of root growth by bicarbonate was associated with enhanced net efflux of K+ and NO3-indicating an adverse effect of bicarbonate on root plasma membrane integrity as a primary cause of root growth inhibition. Impairment of Fe acquisition may be predicted as a consequence of the root growth inhibition.

AB Photosynthetic light response curves (A/PPFD), leaf N concentration and content, and relative leaf absorbance (alpha(r)) were measured in 1-year-old seedlings of shade-intolerant Betula papyrifera Marsh., moderately shade-tolerant Quercus rubra L. and shade-tolerant Acer rubrum L. Seedlings were grown in full sun or 26% of full sun (shade) and in ambient (350 ppm) or elevated (714 ppm) CO2 for 80 days. In the shade treatments, 80% of the daily PPFD on cloud-free days was provided by two 30-min sun patches at midday. In e. rubra and A. rubrum, leaf N concentration and a, were significantly higher in seedlings in the shade treatments than in the sun treatments, and leaf N concentration was lower in seedlings in the ambient CO2 treatments than in the elevated CO2 treatments. Changes in a, and leaf N content suggest that reapportionment of leaf N into light harvesting machinery in response to shade and elevated CO2 tended to increase with increasing shade tolerance of the plant. Shifts induced by elevated CO2 in the A/PPFD relationship in sun plants were largest in B. papyrifera and least in A. rubrum: the reverse was true for shade plants. Elevated CO2 resulted in increased light-saturated A in every species x light treatment combination, except in shaded B. papyrifera. The light compensation point (T) decreased in response to shade in all species, and in response to elevated CO2 in A. rubrum and e. rubra. Acer rubrum had the greatest increases in apparent quantum yield (phi) in response to shade and elevated CO2. To illustrate the effects of shifts in A, r and phi on daily C gain, daily integrated C balance was calculated for individual sun and shade leaves. Ignoring possible stomatal effects, estimated daily (24 h) leaf C balance was 218 to 442% higher in the elevated CO2 treatments than in the ambient CO2 treatments in both sun and shade seedlings of e. rubra and A. rubrum. These results suggest that the ability of species to acclimate photosynthetically to elevated CO:! may, in part, be related to their ability to adapt to low irradiance. Such a relationship has implications for altered C balance and nitrogen use efficiency of understory seedlings.

AB De Wit replacement series were used to study competitive interactions between epiphytic Ice(+) Pseudomonas syringae strains and the biological frost control agents Ice(-) P. syringae TLP2del1 and Pseudomonas fluorescens A506. Mixtures containing two strains in different proportions but at a constant total population size were inoculated onto potato leaves. The population sizes of each strain and the total population size were determined when the community had reached equilibrium. A near-isogenic P. syringae strain pair exhibited an interaction similar to that expected for strains competing equally for limiting environmental resources. Replacement series with nonisogenic Ice(+) and Ice(-) P. syringae strain pairs suggested that these strains competed for limiting resources according to their relative competitive abilities. There was no evidence of any niche differentiation between the Ice(+) P. syringae strains and the Ice(-) P. syringae strain. The growth responses of epiphytes following addition of nutrients to the phyllosphere indicated that the epiphytic P. syringae populations were nutrient limited and that, under growth chamber conditions, the populations were more limited by the availability of carbon than by the availability of nitrogen. Determination of in vitro carbon source utilization profiles provided further evidence for the lack of niche differentiation between the Ice(+) and the Ice(-) P.syringae strains. Niche overlap indices calculated for the Ice(+) P. syringae strains with respect to Ice(-) P. syringae TLP2del1 were uniformly high, indicating ecological similarity, and were consistent with the observed low level of coexistence. The biological frost control agent P. fluorescens A506 replaced P. syringae. This was correlated with a high degree of niche overlap between these species.

AB The highly productive northern Bering and Chukchi marine shelf ecosystem has long been dominated by strong seasonality in sea-ice and water temperatures. Extremely warm conditions from 2017 into 2019-including loss of ice cover across portions of the region in all three winters-were a marked change even from other recent warm years. Biological indicators suggest that this change of state could alter ecosystem structure and function. Here, we report observations of key physical drivers, biological responses and consequences for humans, including subsistence hunting, commercial fishing and industrial shipping. We consider whether observed state changes are indicative of future norms, whether an ecosystem transformation is already underway and, if so, whether shifts are synchronously functional and system wide or reveal a slower cascade of changes from the physical environment through the food web to human society. Understanding of this observed process of ecosystem reorganization may shed light on transformations occurring elsewhere.
   Exceptionally warm years in 2017-2019 have caused changes in the physical and biological characteristics of the Pacific Arctic Ocean. What these changes mean for the ecosystem and societal consequences will depend on if they are evidence of a transformation or anomalies in the system.

AB Kelp forests represent some of the most diverse and productive habitats on Earth, and provide a range of ecosystem goods and services on which human populations depend. As the distribution and ecophysiology of kelp species is strongly influenced by temperature, recent warming trends in many regions have been linked with concurrent changes in kelp populations, communities and ecosystems. Over the past decade, the number of reports of ocean warming impacts on kelp forests has risen sharply. Here, I synthesise recent studies to highlight general patterns and trends. While kelp responses to climate change vary greatly between ocean basins, regions and species, there is compelling evidence to show that ocean warming poses an unequivocal threat to the persistence and integrity of kelp forest ecosystems in coming decades.

AB Species distribution models (SDMs) have rapidly evolved into one of the most widely used tools to answer a broad range of ecological questions, from the effects of climate change to challenges for species management. Current SDMs and their predictions under anthropogenic climate change are, however, often based on free-air or synoptic temperature conditions with a coarse resolution, and thus fail to capture apparent temperature (cf. microclimate) experienced by living organisms within their habitats. Yet microclimate operates as soon as a habitat can be characterized by a vertical component (e.g. forests, mountains, or cities) or by horizontal variation in surface cover. The mismatch between how we usually express climate (cf. coarse-grained free-air conditions) and the apparent microclimatic conditions that living organisms experience has only recently been acknowledged in SDMs, yet several studies have already made considerable progress in tackling this problem from different angles. In this review, we summarize the currently available methods to obtain meaningful microclimatic data for use in distribution modelling. We discuss the issue of extent and resolution, and propose an integrated framework using a selection of appropriately-placed sensors in combination with both the detailed measurements of the habitat 3D structure, for example derived from digital elevation models or airborne laser scanning, and the long-term records of free-air conditions from weather stations. As such, we can obtain microclimatic data with a relevant spatiotemporal resolution and extent to dynamically model current and future species distributions.

AB The utility of plant functional traits for predictive ecology relies on our ability to interpret trait variation across multiple taxonomic and ecological scales. Using extensive data sets of trait variation within species, across species and across communities, we analysed whether and at what scales leaf economics spectrum (LES) traits show predicted trait-trait covariation. We found that most variation in LES traits is often, but not universally, at high taxonomic levels (between families or genera in a family). However, we found that trait covariation shows distinct taxonomic scale dependence, with some trait correlations showing opposite signs within vs. across species. LES traits responded independently to environmental gradients within species, with few shared environmental responses across traits or across scales. We conclude that, at small taxonomic scales, plasticity may obscure or reverse the broad evolutionary linkages between leaf traits, meaning that variation in LES traits cannot always be interpreted as differences in resource use strategy.

AB Habitat loss is the dominant threat to biodiversity and ecosystem functioning in terrestrial environments. In this study, we used an a priori classification of bird species based on their dependence on native forest habitats (forest-specialist and habitat generalists) and specific food resources (frugivores and insectivores) to evaluate their responses to forest cover reduction in landscapes in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. From the patch-landscapes approach, we delimited 40 forest sites, and quantified the percentage of native forest within a 2 km radius around the center of each site (from 6 - 85%). At each site, we sampled birds using the point-count method. We used a null model, a generalized linear model and a four-parameter logistic model to evaluate the relationship between richness and abundance of the bird groups and the native forest amount. A piecewise model was then used to determine the threshold value for bird groups that showed nonlinear responses. The richness and abundance of the bird community as a whole were not affected by changes in forest cover in this region. However, a decrease in forest cover had a negative effect on diversity of forest-specialist, frugivorous and insectivorous birds, and a positive effect on generalist birds. The species richness and abundance of all ecological groups were nonlinearly related to forest reduction and showed similar threshold values, i.e., there were abrupt changes in individuals and species numbers when forest amount was less than approximately 50%. Forest sites within landscapes with forest cover that was less than 50% contained a different bird species composition than more extensively forested sites and had fewer forest-specialist species and higher beta-diversity. Our study demonstrated the pervasive effect of forest reduction on bird communities in one of the most important hotspots for bird conservation and shows that many vulnerable species require extensive forest cover to persist.

AB The study of soil N cycling processes has been, is, and will be at the centre of attention in soil science research. The importance of N as a nutrient for all biota; the ever-increasing rates of its anthropogenic input in terrestrial (agro)ecosystems; its resultant losses to the environment; and the complexity of the biological, physical, and chemical factors that regulate N cycling processes all contribute to the necessity of further understanding, measuring, and altering the soil N cycle. Here, we review important insights with respect to the soil N cycle that have been made over the last decade, and present a personal view on the key challenges of future research. We identify three key challenges with respect to basic N cycling processes producing gaseous emissions:
   1. quantifying the importance of nitrifier denitrification and its main controlling factors;
   2. characterizing the greenhouse gas mitigation potential and microbiological basis for N2O consumption;
   3. characterizing hotspots and hot moments of denitrification
   Furthermore, we identified a key challenge with respect to modelling:
   1. disentangling gross N transformation rates using advanced N-15/O-18 tracing models
   Finally, we propose four key challenges related to how ecological interactions control N cycling processes:
   1. linking functional diversity of soil fauna to N cycling processes beyond mineralization;
   2. determining the functional relationship between root traits and soil N cycling;
   3. characterizing the control that different types of mycorrhizal symbioses exert on N cycling;
   4. quantifying the contribution of non-symbiotic pathways to total N fixation fluxes in natural systems
   We postulate that addressing these challenges will constitute a comprehensive research agenda with respect to the N cycle for the next decade. Such an agenda would help us to meet future challenges on food and energy security, biodiversity conservation, water and air quality, and climate stability.

AB Species distribution models (SDMs) are important tools for forecasting the potential impacts of future environmental changes but debate remains over the most robust modelling approaches for making projections. Suggested improvements in SDMs vary from algorithmic development through to more mechanistic modelling approaches. Here, we focus on the improvements that can be gained by conditioning SDMs on more detailed data. Specifically, we use breeding bird data from across Europe to compare the relative performances of SDMs trained on presence-absence data and those trained on abundance data. Species distribution models trained on presence-absence data, with a poor to slight fit according to Cohen's kappa, show an average improvement in model performance of 032 (SE +/- 012) when trained on abundance data. Even those species for which models trained on presence-absence data are classified as good to excellent show a mean improvement in Cohen's kappa score of 005 (SE +/- 001) when corresponding SDMs are trained on abundance data. This improved explanatory power is most pronounced for species of high prevalence. Our results illustrate that even using coarse scale abundance data, large improvements in our ability to predict species distributions can be achieved. Furthermore, predictions from abundance models provide a greater depth of information with regard to population dynamics than their presence-absence model counterparts. Currently, despite the existence of a wide variety of abundance data sets, species distribution modellers continue to rely almost exclusively on presence-absence data to train and test SDMs. Given our findings, we advocate that, where available, abundance data rather than presence-absence data can be used to more accurately predict the ecological consequences of environmental change. Additionally, our findings highlight the importance of informative baseline data sets. We therefore recommend the move towards increased collection of abundance data, even if only coarse numerical scales of recording are possible.

AB Climate change may considerably impact the carbon (C) dynamics and C stocks of forest soils. To assess the combined effects of warming and reduced precipitation on soil CO2 efflux, we conducted a two-way factorial manipulation experiment (4 similar to degrees C soil warming similar to+similar to throughfall exclusion) in a temperate spruce forest from 2008 until 2010. Soil was warmed by heating cables throughout the growing seasons. Soil drought was simulated by throughfall exclusions with three 100 similar to m2 roofs during 25 similar to days in July/August 2008 and 2009. Soil warming permanently increased the CO2 efflux from soil, whereas throughfall exclusion led to a sharp decrease in soil CO2 efflux (45% and 50% reduction during roof installation in 2008 and 2009, respectively). In 2008, CO2 efflux did not recover after natural rewetting and remained lowered until autumn. In 2009, CO2 efflux recovered shortly after rewetting, but relapsed again for several weeks. Drought offset the increase in soil CO2 efflux by warming in 2008 (growing season CO2 efflux in t C similar to ha-1: control: 7.1 similar to+/-similar to 1.0; warmed: 9.5 similar to+/-similar to 1.7; warmed similar to+similar to roof: 7.4 similar to+/-similar to 0.3; roof: 5.9 similar to+/-similar to 0.4) and in 2009 (control: 7.6 similar to+/-similar to 0.8; warmed similar to+similar to roof: 8.3 similar to+/-similar to 1.0). Throughfall exclusion mainly affected the organic layer and the top 5 similar to cm of the mineral soil. Radiocarbon data suggest that heterotrophic and autotrophic respiration were affected to the same extent by soil warming and drying. Microbial biomass in the mineral soil (05 similar to cm) was not affected by the treatments. Our results suggest that warming causes significant C losses from the soil as long as precipitation patterns remain steady at our site. If summer droughts become more severe in the future, warming induced C losses will likely be offset by reduced soil CO2 efflux during and after summer drought.

AB Inbreeding and a consequent loss of genetic diversity threaten small, isolated populations. One mechanism by which genetically impoverished populations may become extinct is through decreased immunocompetence and higher susceptibility to parasites. Here, we investigate the relationship between immunity and inbreeding in bumblebees, using Hebridean island populations of Bombus muscorum. We sampled nine populations and recorded parasite prevalence and measured two aspects of immunity: the encapsulation response and levels of phenoloxidase (PO). We found that prevalence of the gut parasite Crithidia bombi was higher in populations with lower genetic diversity. Neither measure of immune activity was correlated with genetic diversity. However, levels of PO declined with age and were also negatively correlated with parasite abundance. Our results suggest that as insect populations lose heterozygosity, the impact of parasitism will increase, pushing threatened populations closer to extinction.

AB Increasing evidence highlights the role that botanic gardens might have in plant invasions across the globe. Botanic gardens, often in global biodiversity hotspots, have been implicated in the early cultivation and/or introduction of most environmental weeds listed by IUCN as among the worst invasive species worldwide. Furthermore, most of the popular ornamental species in living collections around the globe have records as alien weeds. Voluntary codes of conduct to prevent the dissemination of invasive plants from botanic gardens have had limited uptake, with few risk assessments undertaken of individual living collections. A stronger global networking of botanic gardens to tackle biological invasions involving public outreach, information sharing and capacity building is a priority to prevent the problems of the past occurring in the future.

AB In the last decade, the application of predictive models of species distribution in ecology, evolution, and conservation biology has increased dramatically. However, limited available data and the lack of reliable absence data have become a major challenge to overcome. At least two approaches have been proposed to generate pseudo-absences; however it is not clear how the number of pseudo-absences created affect model performance. Moreover, the spatial bias in the collecting localities of a species (presence data) may add extra noise to the final distribution model. Here, we use a virtual species to assess the effects of spatial sampling bias, and number and location of pseudo-absences on model accuracy. We found that both number of pseudo-absences and spatial bias in sampling localities, as well as their interaction, significantly influence all accuracy measures (AUC, sensitivity, and specificity). However, location of pseudo-absences (either generated across the entire study area or only outside the environmental envelope of the species) does not affect model performance. These results provide some methodological guidelines for developing reliable distribution hypotheses when presence data are scarce. (C) 2010 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB Extreme climate events produce simultaneous changes to the mean and to the variance of climatic variables over ecological time scales. While several studies have investigated how ecological systems respond to changes in mean values of climate variables, the combined effects of mean and variance are poorly understood. We examined the response of low-shore assemblages of algae and invertebrates of rocky seashores in the northwest Mediterranean to factorial manipulations of mean intensity and temporal variance of aerial exposure, a type of disturbance whose intensity and temporal patterning of occurrence are predicted to change with changing climate conditions. Effects of variance were often in the opposite direction of those elicited by changes in the mean. Increasing aerial exposure at regular intervals had negative effects both on diversity of assemblages and on percent cover of filamentous and coarsely branched algae, but greater temporal variance drastically reduced these effects. The opposite was observed for the abundance of barnacles and encrusting coralline algae, where high temporal variance of aerial exposure either reversed a positive effect of mean intensity (barnacles) or caused a negative effect that did not occur under low temporal variance (encrusting algae). These results provide the first experimental evidence that changes in mean intensity and temporal variance of climatic variables affect natural assemblages of species interactively, suggesting that high temporal variance may mitigate the ecological impacts of ongoing and predicted climate changes.

AB Although many coastal shark species have widespread distributions, the genetic relatedness of worldwide populations has been examined for few species. The blacktip shark, (Carcharhinus limbatus), inhabits tropical and subtropical coastal waters throughout the world. In this study, we examined the genetic relationships of blacktip shark populations (n = 364 sharks) throughout the majority of the species' range using the entire mitochondrial control region (1067-1070 nucleotides). Two geographically distinct maternal lineages (western Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico, and Caribbean Sea clades, and eastern Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Ocean clades) were identified and shallow population structure was detected throughout their geographic ranges. These findings indicate that a major population subdivision exists across the Atlantic Ocean, but not the Pacific Ocean. The historical dispersal of this widespread, coastal species may have been interrupted by the rise of the Isthmus of Panama. This scenario implies historical dispersal across the Pacific Ocean (supported by the recovery of the same common haplotype from the Philippines, Hawaii, and the Gulf of California reflecting recent/contemporary dispersal abilities) and an oceanic barrier to recent migration across the Atlantic. Genetic structure within the eastern Atlantic/Indo-Pacific (Phi(ST) = 0.612, P < 0.001) supports maternal philopatry throughout this area, expanding previous western Atlantic findings. Eastern Atlantic/Indo-Pacific C. limbatus control region haplotypes were paraphyletic to Carcharhinus tilstoni haplotypes in our maximum-parsimony analysis. The greater divergence of western Atlantic C. limbatus than C. tilstoni from eastern Atlantic/Indo-Pacific C. limbatus reflects the taxonomic uncertainty of western Atlantic C. limbatus.

DT Article
DE effective population size; linkage disequilibrium; sampling bias
ID ALLELE FREQUENCIES; TEMPORAL-CHANGES; EVOLUTION; MARKERS
AB Effective population size (N-e) is a central concept in evolutionary biology and conservation genetics. It predicts rates of loss of neutral genetic variation, fixation of deleterious and favourable alleles, and the increase of inbreeding experienced by a population. A method exists for the estimation of N-e from the observed linkage disequilibrium between unlinked loci in a population sample. While an increasing number of studies have applied this method in natural and managed populations, its reliability has not yet been evaluated. We developed a computer program to calculate this estimator of N-e using the most widely used linkage disequilibrium algorithm and used simulations to show that this estimator is strongly biased when the sample size is small (< 100) and below the true N-e. This is probably due to the linkage disequilibrium generated by the sampling process itself and the inadequate correction for this phenomenon in the method. Results suggest that N-e estimates derived using this method should be regarded with caution in many cases. To improve the method's reliability and usefulness we propose a way to determine whether a given sample size exceeds the population N-e and can therefore be used for the computation of an unbiased estimate.

AB The new outline of relationships in basal branches of the family Compositae Giseke confirms that the sister group to the tribe Cardueae Cass. are not Mutisieae Cass., but rather a group of African genera now classified as the tribe Tarchonantheae Kostel. This change implies that the monophyly of the Cardueae must be reassessed on a molecular basis. Moreover, new collections in recent years allow us to extend our sampling to 70 of the 74 genera of the tribe. We performed a new molecular study of the tribe using one nuclear region (ITS) and two chloroplastic markers (trnL-trnF and matK) in addition to a more appropriate outgroup. Our results confirm that the Cardueac is a natural group but indicate some changes in subtribal delineation: the subtribe Cardopatiinae Less. is recognized and some genera are moved to other subtribes (Myopordon Boiss., Nikitinia Iljin, Syreitschikovia Pavlov, and the Xeranthemum L. group). A recapitulation of a number of interesting questions that remain unresolved in the classification of some large genera is presented.

AB Our current understanding of the silicon (Si) cycle in the ocean assumes that diatoms dominate not only the uptake of silicic acid, but also the production and recycling of biogenic silica (BSi), and that other organisms with siliceous skeletons, including sponges, radiolarians, and silicoflagellates, play a negligible role. In this study, we reexamine some aspects of the potential contribution by sponges and present in vitro evidence that BSi in the form of sponge spicules redissolves into silicic acid at far slower rates than those known for diatom frustules. We also show that the retention of Si by siliceous sponges in some sublittoral and bathyal environments is substantial and that sponge populations function as Si sinks. Additionally, by reanalyzing published information on sponge growth and BSi content, we estimate that BSi production rates by sublittoral sponges in Si-poor and Si-rich marine areas fall quite close to values known for diatom assemblages. Therefore, sponges may affect Si cycling dynamics and Si availability for diatoms, particularly in Si-depleted environments. Altogether, our data strongly suggest that the role of sponges in the benthopelagic coupling of the Si cycle is significant.

AB Background and Anus The paper by Monsi and Saeki in 1953 (Japanese Journal of Botany 14: 22-52) was pioneering not only in mathematical modelling of canopy photosynthesis but also in eco-developmental studies of seasonal changes in leaf canopies.
   Scope Construction and maintenance mechanisms of efficient photosynthetic systems at three different scaling levels-single leaves, herbaceous plants and trees-are reviewed mainly based on the nitrogen optimization theory. First. the nitrogen optimization theory with respect to the canopy and the single leaf is briefly introduced. Secondly, significance of leaf thickness in CO2 diffusion in the leaf and in leaf photosynthesis is discussed. Thirdly, mechanisms of adjustment of photosynthetic properties of the leaf within the herbaceous plant individual throughout its life are discussed. In particular, roles of sugar sensing, redox control and of cytokinin are highlighted. Finally, the development of a tree is considered.
   Conclusions Various mechanisms contribute to construction and maintenance of efficient photosynthetic systems. Molecular backgrounds of these ecologically important mechanisms should be clarified. The construction mechanisms of the tree cannot be explained solely by the nitrogen optimization theory. It is proposed that the pipe model theory in its differential form could be a potential tool in future studies in this research area. (C) 2004 Annals of Botany Company.

AB There is increasing evidence that culture is an important determinant of behavior in some non-human species including great apes and cetaceans (whales and dolphins). In some cases, there may be repercussions for population biology and conservation. Rapidly evolving "horizontal" cultures, transmitted largely within generations, may help animals deal with anthropogenic change and even allow them to exploit it, sometimes with negative consequences for both the animals and humans. In contrast, stable "vertical" or "oblique" cultures, transmitted principally between generations, may impede adaptation to environmental change, and confound range recovery, reintroductions and translocations. Conformist stable cultures can lead to maladaptive behavior, which may be mistaken for the results of anthropogenic threats. They can also structure populations into sympatric sub-populations with distinctive cultural variants. Such structuring is common among cetaceans, among which sympatric sub-populations may face different anthropogenic threats or respond to the same threat in different ways. We suggest that non-human culture should be integrated into conservation biology when considering populations with such attributes, and also more generally by refining definitions of evolutionarily significant units and considering how cultural attributes may change our perspectives of non-humans.

AB We studied the conservation status of Atlantic forest birds in 43 forest fragments ranging in size from 1 to 384 ha in the Vicosa region of southeastern Brazil. We compared data from 15 years of field work with historical records from the region, mainly originating from specimens collected by Joao Moojen during the 1930s. We used published studies associated with museum data and current field work to assess the decline of forest birds during the last 70 years and to relate their disappearance to forest fragmentation and destruction. At least 28 bird species have become locally extinct, 43 are critically endangered, and 25 are vulnerable, representing 60.7% of the original forest bird community known to exist in the region. Vulnerability to fragmentation differed among guilds, forest strata, and endemicity status. Birds that feed on fruit and seeds, and those that feed on insects, were more threatened than omnivores and carnivores. Nectarivorous species were less threatened than other guilds. Moreover, terrestrial and understory birds or birds using only one forest stratum also were more likely to have been threatened. Finally, Atlantic forest endemics were more likely to have become extinct than nonendemic species. In general, sensitivity to environmental disturbance at the local level was similar to the predicted vulnerability to regional disturbance derived from the literature. Our results indicate that a serious decline of Atlantic forest birds is underway and that many other species of birds, not previously recognized as threatened, are of conservation concern.

AB Analyses of long-term data indicate that human-caused climatic changes are affecting bird phenology in directions consistent with theoretical predictions. Here, we report on recent trends in the timing of spring arrival and egg laying found within a western European Pied Flycatcher Ficedula hypoleuca population. Mean egg laying date has advanced over the past 20 years in this population. The advancement in egg laying date was stronger than the advancement of spring arrival, suggesting that Pied Flycatchers are changing these stages of their annual cycle at different rates. It could be shown that selection for earlier breeding had increased. Hence, the observed adjustment in laying date did not match the advancement of spring. Our findings raise general questions about the adaptability of migratory birds to rapid environmental changes. Adaptive advancement of reproduction in response to increasing spring temperatures and to the concomitant advancement of food supply could be held back, because annual breeding and migration cycles are controlled primarily by endogenous rhythms and photoperiodic cues which do not relate to temperature. Migrants may have several options for arriving earlier on the breeding grounds, including an increase in migration speed, earlier departure from the wintering area or a shortening of migration distance. Changes in migratory behaviour could be accomplished either by phenotypic plasticity or by selection on different genotypes. Although descriptive field data provide compelling evidence for changes in, and possible constraints on, the timing of breeding and migration, their explanatory power in predicting the limits of adaptation remains restricted. We review recent experimental approaches, which explicitly test the relative roles of genetic versus environmental factors in the adaptation of life-cycle timing to global environmental changes.

AB Tailed frogs are distributed in high-gradient streams within the disjunct mesic forests of the Pacific North west and represent the basal lineage of the anurans. We sequenced 1530 nucleotides of the mitochondrial cytochrome b and NADH dehydrogenase subunit two genes from 23 populations and used parsimony, maximum-likelihood, and nested-clade analyses to estimate relationships among populations and infer evolutionary processes. We found two divergent haplotype clades corresponding with inland Rocky Mountain populations and coastal populations and separated by up to 0.133 substitutions per site. Within the coastal assemblage, haplotypes formed clades by mountain range with 0.010-0.024 substitutions per site divergence among populations. Inland haplotypes exhibited minimal genetic structure, with the exception of 0.021 substitutions per site distance between populations from the East Fork of the South Fork of the Salmon River and all other inland haplotypes. The magnitude of divergence between inland and coastal populations, as well as the paleobotanical record, suggest isolation of these lineages occurred during the late Miocene to early Pliocene, probably in response to the rise of the Cascade Mountains. Genetic structure within coastal and inland populations is consistent with isolation in refugia during the late Pliocene and early Pleistocene. Closely related inland haplotypes reflect range expansion following glaciation. The depth of divergence between inland and coastal populations supports the persistence of mesic forests within the inland Pacific Northwest throughout the Pleistocene and is congruent with patterns found in several other mesic forest species. Based on mitochondrial divergence and previous allozyme and morphological data, we recommend recognition of inland populations as a distinct species, Ascaphus montanus.

AB The harbour porpoise, Phocoena phocoena, experiences high levels of nonnatural mortality owing to interactions with commercial fisheries throughout its range. To accurately evaluate the significance of this bycatch, information on population structure is required. We have examined the population structure of this species in the northwest Atlantic Ocean using mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequence and nuclear microsatellite data. Samples from four previously proposed summer breeding populations-the Gulf of Maine, eastern Newfoundland, the Gulf of St Lawrence and West Greenland-were analysed. Control-region sequences revealed a significant partitioning of genetic variation among most of these summer populations, indicating that northwest Atlantic harbour porpoises should not be considered one panmictic population. Analysis of females alone yielded the highest levels of population subdivision, suggesting that females are more philopatric than males. At least three management units may be defined for harbour porpoises in the northwest Atlantic based on these data. Analysis of six microsatellite loci failed to detect significant population subdivision. Male-mediated gene flow may maintain homogeneity among nuclear loci, while female philopatry is sufficient to produce a signal of population subdivision in the maternally inherited mtDNA genome, mtDNA analyses also indicate that winter aggregations of harbour porpoises along the US mid-Atlantic states comprise animals from more than one summer breeding population.

AB The histories of management of the Sumilon and Apo marine reserves in the Philippines provide a stark contrast. Both began with marine conservation and education programs at the community level, initiated by the Marine Laboratory of Silliman University in 1973 at Sumilon, and in 1976 at Ape. At both islands community support for the "no take" reserve concept evolved gradually, via perceived benefits of increased local fish yields and income from tourism. However, Sumilon reserve has been fished down twice (in 1984, 1992): and was still being fished in December 1998. Apo reserve has been protected from fishing successfully for 16 y (1982-1998). The management histories of these two marine reserves are the longest and most detailed available for coral reefs. Scientific data spanning 1976-1993 for Sumilon and 1980-1993 for Apo have provided some of the best available evidence of the utility of such reserves as management tools in coral reef fisheries. At Sumilon, collapse of reserve protection in 1984, after 9.5 y of restrictions on fishing, led to significant declines in reef fisheries yields in areas adjacent to the reserve. At Ape, continuous protection from 1982 to 1993 has led to consistent build up of fish in the reserve and some evidence that local fish yields have increased. The unique time series of scientific data obtained from Sumilon and Apo islands are the result of their distinct management histories. The greater success of management at Apo was due to community support for the reserve concept being actively maintained: for the past 16 y. Socio-political factors caused the level of community support for the Sumilon reserve to wax nd wane over this period. Both case histories have had a profound effect on marine resource management in the Philippines. As marine reserve models they had substantial influence on the design of the National Integrated Protected Area System (NIPAS). Policy now encourages co-management between the National government and local communities, with a strong emphasis on decentralization of decision malting and recognition of local territorial use rights in fisheries.

AB Survival and growth of abalone postlarvae are greatly influenced by food quality and quantity. Abalone larvae settle on coralline algae, some diatoms films, and conspecific mucous trails. These substrata provide a wide range of potential food sources, which are used in different ways as postlarvae develop. We identify three major transitions in feeding and growth: (1) at metamorphosis, a shift from lecithotrophy/dissolved organic matter (DOM) absorption to particle feeding, with an overlap in nutrition sources; (2) at about 600-800 mu m shelf length (SL), postlarvae become responsive to the "digestibility'' of diatom diets and grow more rapidly on efficiently digested strains; (3) at around 5-10 mm SL juveniles shift from a biofilm-dominated diet to a macroalgae-dominated diet. We can make some tentative generalizations about growth rates of postlarvae fed ingestible diatoms. Rapid growth (20-30 mu m/day) in the first 10 days postsettlement often falls to 10-20 mu m/day in the following 1-2 wk, perhaps reflecting the exhaustion of nutrition from yolk/DOM. Postlarvae of 0.8-2 mm SL grow similar to 40-60 mu m/day on "digestible" diatoms and 15-30 mu m/day on "indigestible" ones. Rapidly growing juveniles over 3 mm SL will grow at 100 mu m/day or more, whereas poor diets can halve these growth rates. Growth rates of individual abalone will vary widely on both good and poor diets. Diatoms that are emerging as key species for abalone culture include Cylindrotheca closterium land needle-shaped Nitzschia spp.), Cocconeis spp., and Achnanthes spp., but caution is needed in extrapolating from the limited data avilable.

TI Biotic interactions in species distribution modelling: 10 questions to
   guide interpretation and avoid false conclusions

AB Aim
   Recent studies increasingly use statistical methods to infer biotic interactions from co-occurrence information at a large spatial scale. However, disentangling biotic interactions from other factors that can affect co-occurrence patterns at the macroscale is a major challenge.
   ApproachFindingsWe present a set of questions that analysts and reviewers should ask to avoid erroneously attributing species association patterns to biotic interactions. Our questions relate to the appropriateness of data and models, the causality behind a correlative signal, and the problems associated with static data from dynamic systems. We summarize caveats reported by macroecological studies of biotic interactions and examine whether conclusions on the presence of biotic interactions are supported by the modelling approaches used.
   Irrespective of the method used, studies that set out to test for biotic interactions find statistical associations in species' co-occurrences. Yet, when compared with our list of questions, few purported interpretations of such associations as biotic interactions hold up to scrutiny. This does not dismiss the presence or importance of biotic interactions, but it highlights the risk of too lenient interpretation of the data. Combining model results with information from experiments and functional traits that are relevant for the biotic interaction of interest might strengthen conclusions.
   Main conclusionsMoving from species- to community-level models, including biotic interactions among species, is of great importance for process-based understanding and forecasting ecological responses. We hope that our questions will help to improve these models and facilitate the interpretation of their results. In essence, we conclude that ecologists have to recognize that a species association pattern in joint species distribution models will be driven not only by real biotic interactions, but also by shared habitat preferences, common migration history, phylogenetic history and shared response to missing environmental drivers, which specifically need to be discussed and, if possible, integrated into models.

   VEGETATION; RESPONSES; PRECIPITATION
AB While global deforestation induced by human land use has been quantified, the drivers and extent of simultaneous woody plant encroachment (WPE) into open areas are only regionally known. WPE has important consequences for ecosystem functioning, global carbon balances and human economies. Here we report, using high-resolution satellite imagery, that woody vegetation cover over sub-Saharan Africa increased by 8% over the past three decades and that a diversity of drivers, other than CO2, were able to explain 78% of the spatial variation in this trend. A decline in burned area along with warmer, wetter climates drove WPE, although this has been mitigated in areas with high population growth rates, and high and low extremes of herbivory, specifically browsers. These results confirm global greening trends, thereby bringing into question widely held theories about declining terrestrial carbon balances and desert expansion. Importantly, while global drivers such as climate and CO2 may enhance the risk of WPE, managing fire and herbivory at the local scale provides tools to mitigate continental WPE.

AB Trait-based approaches provide a useful framework to investigate plant strategies for resource acquisition, growth, and competition, as well as plant impacts on ecosystem processes. Despite significant progress capturing trait variation within and among stems and leaves, identification of trait syndromes within fine-root systems and between fine roots and other plant organs is limited. Here we discuss three underappreciated areas where focused measurements of fine-root traits can make significant contributions to ecosystem science. These include assessment of spatiotemporal variation in fine-root traits, integration of mycorrhizal fungi into fine-root-trait frameworks, and the need for improved scaling of traits measured on individual roots to ecosystem-level processes. Progress in each of these areas is providing opportunities to revisit how below-ground processes are represented in terrestrial biosphere models. Targeted measurements of fine-root traits with clear linkages to ecosystem processes and plant responses to environmental change are strongly needed to reduce empirical and model uncertainties. Further identifying how and when suites of root and whole-plant traits are coordinated or decoupled will ultimately provide a powerful tool for modeling plant form and function at local and global scales.

AB 1. Ecological studies identifying a positive relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem services motivate projections that higher plant diversity will increase services from agroecosystems. While this idea is compelling, evidence of generalizable relationships between biodiversity and ecosystem services that could be broadly applied in agricultural systems is lacking.
   2. Cover crops grown in rotation with cash crops are a realistic strategy to increase agroecosystem diversity. We evaluated the prediction that further increasing diversity with cover crop polycultures would enhance ecosystem services and multifunctionality in a 2-year study of eighteen cover crop treatments ranging in diversity from one to eight species. Five ecosystem services were measured in each cover crop system and regression analysis used to explore the relationship between multifunctionality and several diversity indices.
   3. As expected, there was a positive relationship between species richness and multifunctionality, but it only explained a small fraction of variance in ecosystem services ( marginal R-2 = 0.05). In contrast, indices of functional diversity, particularly the distribution of trait abundances, were stronger predictors of multifunctionality (marginal R-2 = 0.15-0.38).
   4. Synthesis and application. In a corn production system, simply increasing cover crop species richness will have a small impact on agroecosystem services, but designing polycultures that maximize functional diversity may lead to agroecosystems with greater multifunctionality.

AB Three interrelated world trends may be exacerbating emerging zoonotic risks: income growth, urbanization, and globalization. Income growth is associated with rising animal protein consumption in developing countries, which increases the conversion of wild lands to livestock production, and hence the probability of zoonotic emergence. Urbanization implies the greater concentration and connectedness of people, which increases the speed at which new infections are spread. Globalization-the closer integration of the world economy-has facilitated pathogen spread among countries through the growth of trade and travel. High-risk areas for the emergence and spread of infectious disease are where these three trends intersect with predisposing socioecological conditions including the presence of wild disease reservoirs, agricultural practices that increase contact between wildlife and livestock, and cultural practices that increase contact between humans, wildlife, and livestock. Such an intersection occurs in China, which has been a "cradle" of zoonoses from the Black Death to avian influenza and SARS. Disease management in China is thus critical to the mitigation of global zoonotic risks.

AB Aims: The choice of environmental predictor variables in correlative models of plant species distributions (hereafter SDMs) is crucial to ensure predictive accuracy and model realism, as highlighted in multiple earlier studies. Because variable selection is directly related to a model's capacity to capture important species' environmental requirements, one would expect an explicit prior consideration of all ecophysiologically meaningful variables. For plants, these include temperature, water, soil nutrients, light, and in some cases, disturbances and biotic interactions. However, the set of predictors used in published correlative plant SDM studies varies considerably. No comprehensive review exists of what environmental predictors are meaningful, available (or missing) and used in practice to predict plant distributions. Contributing to answer these questions is the aim of this review.
   Methods: We carried out an extensive, systematic review of recently published plant SDM studies (years 2010-2015; n = 200) to determine the predictors used (and not used) in the models. We additionally conducted an in-depth review of SDM studies in selected journals to identify temporal trends in the use of predictors (years 2000-2015; n = 40).
   Results: A large majority of plant SDM studies neglected several ecophysiologically meaningful environmental variables, and the number of relevant predictors used in models has stagnated or even declined over the last 15 yr.
   Conclusions: Neglecting ecophysiologically meaningful predictors can result in incomplete niche quantification and can thus limit the predictive power of plant SDMs. Some of these missing predictors are already available spatially or may soon become available (e.g. soil moisture). However, others are not yet easily obtainable across whole study extents (e.g. soil pH and nutrients), and their development should receive increased attention. We conclude that more effort should be made to build ecologically more sound plant SDMs. This requires a more thorough rationale for the choice of environmental predictors needed to meet the study goal, and the development of missing ones. The latter calls for increased collaborative effort between ecological and geo-environmental sciences.

AB To investigate the comparative abilities of six different bioclimatic models in an independent area, utilizing the distribution of eight different species available at a global scale and in Australia. Global scale and Australia. We tested a variety of bioclimatic models for eight different plant species employing five discriminatory correlative species distribution models (SDMs) including Generalized Linear Model (GLM), MaxEnt, Random Forest (RF), Boosted Regression Tree (BRT), Bioclim, together with CLIMEX (CL) as a mechanistic niche model. These models were fitted using a training dataset of available global data, but with the exclusion of Australian locations. The capabilities of these techniques in projecting suitable climate, based on independent records for these species in Australia, were compared. Thus, Australia is not used to calibrate the models and therefore it is as an independent area regarding geographic locations. To assess and compare performance, we utilized the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves (AUC), true skill statistic (TSS), and fractional predicted areas for all SDMs. In addition, we assessed satisfactory agreements between the outputs of the six different bioclimatic models, for all eight species in Australia. The modeling method impacted on potential distribution predictions under current climate. However, the utilization of sensitivity and the fractional predicted areas showed that GLM, MaxEnt, Bioclim, and CL had the highest sensitivity for Australian climate conditions. Bioclim calculated the highest fractional predicted area of an independent area, while RF and BRT were poor. For many applications, it is difficult to decide which bioclimatic model to use. This research shows that variable results are obtained using different SDMs in an independent area. This research also shows that the SDMs produce different results for different species; for example, Bioclim may not be good for one species but works better for other species. Also, when projecting a "large" number of species into novel environments or in an independent area, the selection of the "best" model/technique is often less reliable than an ensemble modeling approach. In addition, it is vital to understand the accuracy of SDMs' predictions. Further, while TSS, together with fractional predicted areas, are appropriate tools for the measurement of accuracy between model results, particularly when undertaking projections on an independent area, AUC has been proved not to be. Our study highlights that each one of these models (CL, Bioclim, GLM, MaxEnt, BRT, and RF) provides slightly different results on projections and that it may be safer to use an ensemble of models.

AB Rapid adaptation of invasive species to novel habitats has puzzled evolutionary biologists for decades, especially as this often occurs in the face of limited genetic variability. Although some ecological traits common to invasive species have been identified, little is known about the possible genomic/genetic mechanisms that may underlie their success. A common scenario in many introductions is that small founder population sizes will often lead to reduced genetic diversity, but that invading populations experience large environmental perturbations, such as changes in habitat and environmental stress. Although sudden and intense stress is usually considered in a negative context, these perturbations may actually facilitate rapid adaptation by affecting genome structure, organization and function via interactions with transposable elements (TEs), especially in populations with low genetic diversity. Stress-induced changes in TE activity can alter gene action and can promote structural variation that may facilitate the rapid adaptation observed in new environments. We focus here on the adaptive potential of TEs in relation to invasive species and highlight their role as powerful mutational forces that can rapidly create genetic diversity. We hypothesize that activity of transposable elements can explain rapid adaptation despite low genetic variation (the genetic paradox of invasive species), and provide a framework under which thishypothesis can be tested using recently developed and emerging genomic technologies.

AB Forests provide humankind with essential raw materials and the demand for these materials is increasing. Further expanding forestry into unmanaged forests is environmentally costly and increasing forest area via plantations will not immediately lead to increased wood supply. Thus, just like in agriculture, forestry faces the challenge how to intensify forest management in existing production forests in sustainable ways. Yet, our current understanding of what determines forest management intensity is weak, particularly at broad scales, and this makes it difficult to assess the environmental and social trade-offs of intensification. Here, we analyse spatial patterns of forest harvesting intensity as one indicator for forest management intensity across Europe, a region where most forests suitable for production are already in use and where future intensification is likely. To measure forest harvesting intensity, we related harvested timber volumes to net annual increment for the period 2000-2010. We used boosted regression trees to analyse the spatial determinants of forest harvesting intensity using a comprehensive set of biophysical and socioeconomic explanatory variables. Our results show that forest harvesting intensity varied markedly across Europe and harvested timber volumes were well below the increment in most regions. Harvesting intensity was especially high in southern Finland, southern Sweden, southwestern France, Switzerland, and the Czech Republic. The spatial patterns of forest harvesting intensity were well explained by forest-resource related variables (i.e., the share of plantation species, growing stock, forest cover), site conditions (i.e., topography, accessibility), and country-specific characteristics, whereas socioeconomic variables were less important. We also found the relationship between forest harvesting intensity and some of its predictors (e.g., share of plantation species, accessibility) to be strongly non-linear and characterised by thresholds. In summary, our study highlights candidate areas where potentials for sustainably intensifying timber production may exist. Our analyses of the spatial determinants of harvesting intensity also provides concrete starting points for developing measures targeted at increasing regional wood supply from forests or lowering harvest pressure in regions where forests are heavily used. Finally, our study emphasises the importance for systems' understanding for designing and implementing effective sustainable forest management policies. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The ecosystem services concept provides both an analytical and communicative tool to identify and quantify the link between human welfare and the environment, and thus to evaluate the ramifications of management interventions. Marine spatial planning (MSP) and Ecosystem-based Management (EBM) are a form of management intervention that has become increasingly popular and important globally. The ecosystem service concept is rarely applied in marine planning and management to date which we argue is due to the lack of a well-structured, systematic classification and assessment of marine ecosystem services. In this paper we not only develop such a typology but also provide guidance to select appropriate indicators for all relevant ecosystem services. We apply this marine-specific ecosystem service typology to MSP and EBM. We thus provide not only a novel theoretical construct but also show how the ecosystem services concept can be used in marine planning and management. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We reviewed the literature on the effects of land use changes on mediterranean river ecosystems (med-rivers) to provide a foundation and directions for future research on catchment management during times of rapid human population growth and climate change. Seasonal human demand for water in mediterranean climate regions (med-regions) is high, leading to intense competition for water with riverine communities often containing many endemic species. The responses of river communities to human alterations of land use, vegetation, hydrological, and hydrochemical conditions are similar in mediterranean and other climatic regions. High variation in hydrological regimes in med-regions, however, tends to exacerbate the magnitude of these responses. For example, land use changes promote longer dry season flows, concentrating contaminants, allowing the accumulation of detritus, algae, and plants, and fostering higher temperatures and lower dissolved oxygen levels, all of which may extirpate sensitive native species. Exotic species often thrive in med-rivers altered by human activity, further homogenizing river communities worldwide. We recommend that future research rigorously evaluate the effects of management and restoration practices on river ecosystems, delineate the cause-effect pathways leading from human perturbations to stream biological communities, and incorporate analyses of the effects of scale, land use heterogeneity, and high temporal hydrological variability on stream communities.

AB Australia has a mostly dry, open, fire-shaped landscape of sclerophyllous and xeromorphic flora dominated by eucalypt and acacia trees, with diverse shrubs from a few families such as Myrtaceae, Proteaceae, and Fabaceae. Using molecular phylogenies to test hypotheses derived from the fossil record, we review the principal forces that transformed the ancestral Gondwanan rainforest through the Cenozoic. Today's vegetation is a mix of ancient radiations that have persisted in Australia through dramatic climate change since before the breakup of Gondwana, and more recent lineages whose ancestors arrived by trans-oceanic dispersal. Signatures in the fossil record of lineage turnover and trait evolutionary change are detected in phylogenies, but often at earlier dates. The Australian biota is a sample of the wider region, with extinction of some taxa and radiation of others (due to chance and opportunity), but biotic and abiotic interactions have resulted in a unique flora and fauna.

AB Conservation science strives to inform management decisions. Applying niche models in concert with future climate projections to project species vulnerability to extinction, range size loss, or distribution shifts has emerged as a potentially useful tool for informing resource management decisions. Making climate change niche modeling useful to conservation decisions requires centering studies on the types of decisions that are made regarding the focal taxa of a niche model study. Recent recommendations for climate adaptation strategies suggest four types of decision makers: policy, habitat protection, habitat management, species management. Targeting research to questions relevant for management decisions will increase utility of a niche model study. Constraints to the accuracy and precision of niche models to project potential future distributions are well-recognized. How to incorporate these uncertainties into management decision-making remains a challenge. Refining estimates and making sound management recommendations is critical because species that are generally modeled to be the most vulnerable to climate change (i.e., narrow endemics), are also the most vulnerable to bad decisions based on uncertain models. I review uncertainties of niche models to assert that there is an inherent bias for models to over-estimate climate-driven vulnerability to extirpation. Explicit recognition of this bias leads to a decision framework that accommodates unbalanced uncertainty. Namely, niche models may be more useful for identifying conservation opportunities identifying newly available habitats under changing climate than they are for asserting where current habitat will no longer exist under future climate states.

AB Current phylogenetic methods attempt to account for evolutionary rate variation across characters in a matrix. This is generally achieved by the use of sophisticated evolutionary models, combined with dense sampling of large numbers of characters. However, systematic biases and superimposed substitutions make this task very difficult. Model adequacy can sometimes be achieved at the cost of adding large numbers of free parameters, with each parameter being optimized according to some criterion, resulting in increased computation times and large variances in the model estimates. In this study, we develop a simple approach that estimates the relative evolutionary rate of each homologous character. The method that we describe uses the similarity between characters as a proxy for evolutionary rate. In this article, we work on the premise that if the character-state distribution of a homologous character is similar to many other characters, then this character is likely to be relatively slowly evolving. If the character-state distribution of a homologous character is not similar to many or any of the rest of the characters in a data set, then it is likely to be the result of rapid evolution. We show that in some test cases, at least, the premise can hold and the inferences are robust. Importantly, the method does not use a "starting tree" to make the inference and therefore is tree independent. We demonstrate that this approach can work as well as a maximum likelihood (ML) approach, though the ML method needs to have a known phylogeny, or at least a very good estimate of that phylogeny. We then demonstrate some uses for this method of analysis, including the improvement in phylogeny reconstruction for both deep-level and recent relationships and overcoming systematic biases such as base composition bias. Furthermore, we compare this approach to two well-established methods for reweighting or removing characters. These other methods are tree-based and we show that they can be systematically biased. We feel this method can be useful for phylogeny reconstruction, understanding evolutionary rate variation, and for understanding selection variation on different characters.

AB We explored the effects of prevalence, latitudinal range and clumping (spatial autocorrelation) of species distribution patterns on the predictive accuracy of eight state-of-the-art modelling techniques: Generalized Linear Models (GLMs), Generalized Boosting Method (GBM), Generalized Additive Models (GAMs), Classification Tree Analysis (CTA), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS), Mixture Discriminant Analysis (MDA) and Random Forest (RF). One hundred species of Lepidoptera, selected from the Distribution Atlas of European Butterflies, and three climate variables were used to determine the bioclimatic envelope for each butterfly species. The data set consisting of 2620 grid squares 30' x 60' in size all over Europe was randomly split into the calibration and the evaluation data sets. The performance of different models was assessed using the area under the curve (AUC) of a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) plot. Observed differences in modelling accuracy among species were then related to the geographical attributes of the species using GAM. The modelling performance was negatively related to the latitudinal range and prevalence, whereas the effect of spatial autocorrelation on prediction accuracy depended on the modelling technique. These three geographical attributes accounted for 19-61% of the variation in the modelling accuracy. Predictive accuracy of GAM, GLM and MDA was highly influenced by the three geographical attributes, whereas RF, ANN and GBM were moderately, and MARS and CTA only slightly affected. The contrasting effects of geographical distribution of species on predictive performance of different modelling techniques represent one source of uncertainty in species spatial distribution models. This should be taken into account in biogeographical modelling studies and assessments of climate change impacts. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Variations in leaf photosynthetic, morphological and biochemical properties with increasing plant height from seedlings to emergent trees were investigated in five dipterocarp species in a Malaysian tropical rain forest. Canopy openness increased significantly with tree height. Photosynthetic properties, such as photosynthetic capacity at light saturation. light compensation point, maximum rate of carboxylation and maximum rate of photosynthetic electron transport. all increased significantly with tree height. Leaf morphological and biochemical traits, such as leaf mass per area, palisade layer thickness, nitrogen concentration per unit area, chlorophyll concentration per unit dry mass and chlorophyll to nitrogen ratio, also changed significantly with tree height. Leaf properties had simple and significant relationships with tree height, with few intra- and interspecies differences. Our results therefore suggest that the photosynthetic capacity of dipterocarp trees depends on tree height, and that the trees adapt to the light environment by adjusting their leaf morphological and biochemical properties. These results should aid in developing models that can accurately estimate carbon dioxide flux and biomass production in tropical rain forests.

AB Background Life forms as diverse as unicellular algae, zooplankton, vascular plants, and mammals appear to obey quarter-power scaling rules. Among the most famous of these rules is Kleiber's (i.e. basal metabolic rates scale as the three-quarters power of body mass), which has a botanical analogue (i.e. annual plant growth rates scale as the three-quarters power of total body mass). Numerous theories have tried to explain why these rules exist, but each has been heavily criticized either on conceptual or empirical grounds.
   N,P-Stoichiometry Recent models predicting growth rates on the basis of how total cell, tissue, or organism nitrogen and phosphorus are allocated, respectively, to protein and rRNA contents may provide the answer, particularly in light of the observation that annual plant growth rates scale linearly with respect to standing leaf mass and that total leaf mass scales isometrically with respect to nitrogen but as the three-quarters power of leaf phosphorus. For example, when these relationships are juxtaposed with other allometric trends, a simple N,P-stoichiometric model successfully predicts the relative growth rates of 131 diverse C-3 and C-4 species.
   Conclusions The melding of allometric and N,P-stoichiometric theoretical insights provides a robust modelling approach that conceptually links the subcellular 'machinery' of protein/ribosomal metabolism to observed growth rates of uni- and multicellular organisms. Because the operation of this 'machinery' is basic to the biology of all life forms, its allometry may provide a mechanistic explanation for the apparent ubiquity of quarter-power scaling rules.

AB The current rapid spread of leishmaniases caused by Leishmania tropica and the complexity of its clinical spectrum call for this parasite's epidemiological and evolutionary investigation. Evaluation of its population structure by isoenzyme electrophoresis and previous molecular biological analysis has proved difficult. In this study, we used 21 microsatellite loci to type 117 strains from different African and Asian locations. Eighty-one different genotypes were found. A genetic bottleneck supported by a gradient in the number of alleles and consistent with the geographical structure of the Middle East suggests an African origin of this species. A Bayesian approach identified 10 genetic clusters that correlated predominantly with geographical origin. The strains in the 'Asia' cluster form a very heterogeneous sub-population, with a varied but inter-related genotype that is geographically very widely dispersed and consistent with anthroponotic transmission of the parasite. The other nine clusters were more homogenous. The propagation of L. tropica appears to be predominantly clonal. In Africa and the Middle East, anthroponotic and zoonotic systems of distribution may contribute to the development of overlapping, genetically distinct populations of L. tropica.

AB The European Union has adopted several environmental directives, strategies, recommendations, and agreements that require a shift from local-or regional-based regulations to more ecosystem-based, holistic environmental management. Over the next decade, environmental management in Europe is likely to focus more on biological and ecological conditions rather than physical and chemical conditions, with ecosystem health at the center of regulation and management decision making. Successful implementation of this new ecosystem management and strategic assessment process in Europe will require the integration of regulatory and technical information and extensive collaboration from among European Union member countries, between agencies, and across disciplines to an unprecedented degree. It will also require extensive efforts to adapt current systems of environmental assessment and management to the basin and ecosystem level, across media and habitats, and considering a much broader set of impacts on ecosystem status than is currently addressed in most risk assessments. This will require the understanding, integration, and communication of economic, ecological, hydrological, and other processes across many spatial and temporal scales. This article discusses these challenges and describes some of the research initiatives that will help achieve integrated ecosystem management in Europe.

AB Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) has undergone radical changes during the evolution of green plants, yet little is known about the dynamics of mtDNA evolution in this phylum. Land plant mtDNAs differ from the few green algal mtDNAs that have been analyzed to date by their expanded size, long spacers, and diversity of introns. We have determined the mtDNA sequence of Chara vulgaris (Charophyceae), a green alga belonging to the charophycean order (Charales) that is thought to be the most closely related alga to land plants. This 67,737-bp mtDNA sequence, displaying 68 conserved genes and 27 introns, was compared with those of three angiosperms, the bryophyte Marchantia polymorpha, the charophycean alga Chaetosphaeridium globosum (Coleochaetales), and the green alga Mesostigma viride. Despite important differences in size and intron composition, Chara mtDNA strikingly resembles Marchantia mtDNA; for instance, all except 9 of 68 conserved genes lie within blocks of colinear sequences. Overall, our genome comparisons and phylogenetic analyses provide unequivocal support for a sister-group relationship between the Charales and the land plants. Only four introns in land plant mtDNAs appear to have been inherited vertically from a charalean algar ancestor. We infer that the common ancestor of green algae and land plants harbored a tightly packed, gene-rich, and relatively intron-poor mitochondrial genome. The group II introns in this ancestral genome appear to have spread to new mtDNA sites during the evolution of bryophytes and charalean green algae, accounting for part of the intron diversity found in Chara and land plant mitochondria.

AB Results led to the development of a conceptual model, which describes that the presence of deep larger diameter roots in shrub areas form large open channels at deeper soil depths, facilitating deep-water percolation, while presence of thin shallow roots in grass areas form small open channels at shallow depths, causing water to remain within shallow depths. Over time these roots systems will alter their environment and facilitate storage and uptake of water and nutrient availability. The difference in rooting depth will decrease the competition for water between the shrub areas and grass areas and cause differences in water distribution and availability.

AB The potential effects of climate change on vegetation are of increasing concern. In the Mediterranean region, the dominant impact of climate change is expected to be through the modification of water balance. In this paper we present a model developed to predict drought-induced mortality of woody plants under different climatic scenarios. The model is physiologically-based and simulates water transport within individual woody plants, which can be isolated or competing for a common water resource. The model assumes that plant mortality is controlled by the carbon balance: when the plant is unable to transport water to the leaves it ceases to acquire carbon and, if this situation lasts long enough, it can no longer survive. In the particular application that we report in this study, two evergreen species are compared, Quercus ilex and Phillyrea latifolia, which were very differently affected by the acute drought that occurred in E Spain in summer 1994. While in some Q. ilex populations the amount of individuals that dried completely was up to 80%, P. latifolia showed almost no damage. During the years 1999 and 2000, canopy transpiration was monitored using sap-flow sensors in individuals of these two species in a Holm-oak forest from NE Spain. A Generalised Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation (GLUE) approach was used to calibrate the model against sap-flow measurements. The only difference between species that was introduced 'a priori' was that Q. ilex was more vulnerable to xylem embolism than P. latifolia (based on our own measurements in the study area). During the calibration process the information provided by the measured sap flows was used to retain the more likely parameter sets for each species. These parameter sets were used in all the following simulations. The model was able to accurately simulate transpiration dynamics of the two species in the study area. When the meteorological conditions of summer 1994 were introduced, the model outputs also reproduced the differential impact that drought had on the two species studied. In the simulations under climate change two factors were explored: the increase in mean temperature (+ 1.5, + 3 and + 4.5 degreesC) through its effect on ET, and the duration of summer drought. Under any of the scenarios, mortalities were much higher for Q. ilex: while this species was predicted to survive with less than 5% mortality droughts of up to 84-94 days, the mortality of P. latifolia reached 5% between days 133 and 150. For droughts longer than 3 months, which is approximately the current drought duration in the study area for dry years, the mortality of Q. ilex increased sharply. These results are discussed in relation to the possible long-term impacts of climate change on Q. ilex-dominated forests. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Examples of Mullerian mimicry, in which resemblance between unpalatable species confers mutual benefit, are rare in vertebrates. Strong comparative evidence for mimicry is found when the colour and pattern of a single species closely resemble several different model species simultaneously in different geographical regions. To demonstrate this, it is necessary to provide compelling evidence that the putative mimics do, in fact, form a monophyletic group. We present molecular phylogenetic evidence that the poison frog Dendrobates imitator mimics three different poison frogs in different geographical regions in Peru. DNA sequences from four different mitochondrial gene regions in putative members of a single species are analysed using parsimony; maximum-likelihood and neighbour-joining methods. The resulting hypotheses of phylogenetic relationships demonstrate that the different populations of D. imitator form a monophyletic group. To our knowledge, these results provide the first evidence for a Mullerian mimetic radiation in amphibians in which a single species mimics different sympatric species in different geographical regions.

AB The complete mitochondrial genomes of two microbats, the horseshoe bat Rhinolophus pumilus, and the Japanese pipistrelle Pipistrellus abramus, and that of an insectivore, the long-clawed shrew Sorex unguiculatus, were sequenced and analyzed phylogenetically by a maximum likelihood method in an effort to enhance our understanding of mammalian evolution. Our analysis suggested that (1) a sister relationship exists between moles and shrews, which form an eulipotyphlan clade; (2) chiropterans have a sister-relationship with eulipotyphlans; and (3) the Eulipotyphla/Chiroptera clade is closely related to fereuungulates (Cetartiodactyla, Perissodactyla and Carnivora). Divergence times on the mammalian tree were estimated from consideration of a relaxed molecular clock, the amino acid sequences of 12 concatenated mitochondrial proteins and multiple reference criteria. Moles and shrews were estimated to have diverged approximately 48 MyrBP, and bats and eulipotyphlans to have diverged 68 MyrBP. Recent phylogenetic controversy over the polyphyly of microbats, the monophyly of rodents, and the position of hedgehogs is also examined.

AB Mating has been found to be costly for females of some species because of toxic products that males transfer to females in their seminal fluid. Such mating costs seem paradoxical, particularly for species in which females mate more frequently than is necessary to fertilize their eggs. Indeed, some studies suggest that females may benefit from mating more frequently. The effect of male ejaculates on female lift: span and lifetime fecundity was experimentally tested in the variable field cricket, Gryllus lineaticeps. In field crickets, females will mate repeatedly with a given male and mate with multiple males Females that were experimentally mated either repeatedly or multiply lived more than 32% longer than singly mated females. In addition, multiply mated females produced 98% more eggs than singly mated females. Because females received only sperm and seminal fluid from males in the experimental matings. these life-span and fecundity benefits may result from beneficial seminal fluid products that males transfer to females during mating. Mating benefits rather than mating costs may be common in many animals, particularly in species where female mate choice has a larger effect on male reproductive success than does the outcome of sperm competition.

AB Leaf mass per unit area (LMA) and internal leaf anatomy often affect net gas exchange because of their effects on internal CO2 conductance to the site of carboxylation, internal shading, competition for CO2 among carboxylation sites, nitrogen concentration and its partitioning. To evaluate effects of LMA and leaf anatomy on CO2 assimilation, water-use efficiency (WUE) and nitrogen-use efficiency (NUE), we measured LMA, leaf thickness, the thickness of mesophyll components, and gas exchange rates at ambient CO2 concentration in leaves of six woody deciduous and evergreen species with different leaf life spans. In two species, CO2 assimilation was also estimated at saturating CO2 concentrations.
   There were interspecific differences in all morphological variables studied. Long-lived leaves had higher LMA and were thicker than short-lived leaves. Species with high LMA had low assimilation rates and NUE, both in ambient and saturating CO2 concentrations. Thus, in species with high LMA, assimilation was reduced by non-stomatal limitations, possibly because of a lower allocation of N to the photosynthetic machinery than in species with low LMA. Within a species, thicker leaves tended to have a lower tissue density. In intraspecific comparisons under field conditions, increasing internal air volume had positive effects on WUE, probably because of enhanced internal CO2 conductance to the site of carboxylation. We conclude that, in interspecific comparisons, different patterns of N partitioning strongly influence NUE, whereas in intraspecific comparisons, internal leaf anatomy is a key factor regulating resource-use efficiency.

Specifically, we examined equal rates, invariable sites, gamma-distributed rates, and site-specific rates (SSR) models, using mitochondrial DNA sequence data from three protein-coding genes and one tRNA gene from species of the New Zealand cicada genus Maoricicada. Estimates of topology were relatively insensitive to the substitution model used; however, estimates of bootstrap support, branch lengths, and R-matrices (underlying relative substitution rate matrix) were strongly influenced by the assumptions of the substitution model. We identified one situation where ME and Mt tree building became inaccurate when implemented with an inappropriate among-site rate Variation model. Despite the fact the SSR models often have a better fit to the data than do invariable sites and gamma rates models, SSR models have some serious weaknesses. First, SSR rate parameters are not comparable across data sets, unlike the proportion of invariable sites or the alpha shape parameter of the gamma distribution. Second, the extreme among-site rate variation within codon positions is problematic for SSR models, which explicitly assume rate homogeneity within each rate class. Third, the SSR models appear to give severe underestimates of R-matrices and branch lengths relative to invariable sites and gamma rates models in this example. We recommend performing phylogenetic analyses under a range of substitution models to test the effects of model assumptions not only on estimates of topology but also on estimates of branch length and nodal support.

AB Many insects carry maternally inherited bacteria which kill male offspring. Such bacteria will spread if male death benefits the female siblings who transmit the bacterium, and they are therefore expected in insects with antagonistic sibling interactions. We report that the butterfly Danaus chrysippus is host to a maternally inherited male-killing bacterium. Using diagnostic PCR and rDNA sequence, the bacterium was identified as a Spiroplasma closely related to 2 ladybird beetle male-killers and the tick symbiont Spiroplasma ixodetis. The male-killer was found to have a geographically restricted distribution, with up to 40% of females being infected in East Africa, but no detectable infection in small samples from other populations. Danaus chrysippus is a surprising host for a male-killer as its eggs are laid singly. This suggests that the ecological conditions permitting male-killers to invade may be more widespread than previously realized.

AB Elongation factor 1 alpha (EF-1 alpha) is a highly conserved ubiquitous protein involved in translation that has been suggested to have desirable properties fur phylogenetic inference. To examine the utility of EF-1 alpha as a phylogenetic marker for eukaryotes, we studied three properties of EF-1 alpha trees: congruency with other phyogenetic markers, the impact of species sampling, and the degree of substitutional saturation occurring between taxa. Our analyses indicate that the EF-1 alpha tree is congruent with some other molecular phylogenies in identifying both the deepest branches and some recent relationships in the eukaryotic line of descent. However, the topology of the intermediate portion of the EF-1 alpha tree, occupied by most of the protist lineages, differs for different phylogenetic methods, and bootstrap values for branches are low. Most problematic in this region is the failure of all phylogenetic methods to resolve the monophyly of two higher-order protistan taxa, the Ciliophora and the Alveolata. JACKMONO analyses indicated that the impact of species sampling on bootstrap support for most internal nodes of the eukaryotic EF-1 alpha tree is extreme. Furthermore, a comparison of observed versus inferred numbers of substitutions indicates that multiple overlapping substitutions have occurred, especially on the branch separating the Eukaryota from the Archaebacteria, suggesting that the rooting of the eukaryotic tree on the diplomonad lineage should be treated with caution. Overall, these results suggest that the phylogenies obtained from EF-1 alpha are congruent with other molecular phylogenies in recovering the monophyly of groups such as the Metazoa, Fungi, Magnoliophyta, and Euglenozoa. However, the interrelationships between these and other protist lineages are not well resolved. This lack of resolution may result from the combined effects of poor taxonomic sampling, relatively few informative positions, large numbers of overlapping substitutions that obscure phylogenetic signal, and lineage-specific rate increases in the EF-1 alpha data set. It is also consistent with the nearly simultaneous diversification of major eukaryotic lineages implied by the "big-bang" hypothesis of eukaryote evolution.

   ECOSYSTEM; PLANTS; CONSERVATION; DISTURBANCE
AB Fire has been a source of global biodiversity for millions of years. However, interactions with anthropogenic drivers such as climate change, land use, and invasive species are changing the nature of fire activity and its impacts. We review how such changes are threatening species with extinction and transforming terrestrial ecosystems. Conservation of Earth's biological diversity will be achieved only by recognizing and responding to the critical role of fire. In the Anthropocene, this requires that conservation planning explicitly includes the combined effects of human activities and fire regimes. Improved forecasts for biodiversity must also integrate the connections among people, fire, and ecosystems. Such integration provides an opportunity for new actions that could revolutionize how society sustains biodiversity in a time of changing fire activity.

AB Climate change is expected to intensify drought in many regions, but ecological impacts on stream communities are poorly understood. Many arid-land streams are characterised by predictable seasonal cycles of wetting and drying, to which species are adapted, but unpredictable supraseasonal droughts may constitute extreme events that challenge resident biota. In this article, we synthesise research conducted in arid-land streams of the Madrean Sky Islands (MSI) in Arizona, U.S.A, to evaluate the resistance and resilience of invertebrate communities to drying disturbances caused by normal seasonal drying and severe supraseasonal drought. We also highlight how spatial context (e.g. distance to perennial refuges) influences recovery patterns. Invertebrate community structure changes predictably as habitat contraction progresses from loss of lateral connectivity to complete drying of MSI streams. When drying events are predictable (e.g. seasonal drying), post-drought community recovery is often rapid, since most MSI taxa possess life history traits conferring high resistance and/or resilience to stream drying. Extreme supraseasonal droughts, in contrast, cause unprecedented transitions from perennial to intermittent flow in some MSI streams. While species richness may recover quickly following this flow regime shift, marked turnover in community structure can occur and may delay or preclude recovery to pre-drought conditions. In such cases, short-lived (<1year) strong dispersers replace relatively long-lived (1year) weak dispersers. As habitat isolation increases, the potential for community recovery from extreme drought decreases. Many MSI aquatic species are threatened by extreme drought. Extinctions of endemic aquatic species due to habitat drying have already been observed in nearby deserts. Further studies are urgently needed to identify drought-sensitive species and understand how the loss of such species may affect stream ecosystem functioning.

AB Patterns of tropical forest functional diversity express processes of ecological assembly at multiple geographic scales and aid in predicting ecological responses to environmental change. Tree canopy chemistry underpins forest functional diversity, but the interactive role of phylogeny and environment in determining the chemical traits of tropical trees is poorly known. Collecting and analyzing foliage in 2,420 canopy tree species across 19 forests in the western Amazon, we discovered (i) systematic, community-scale shifts in average canopy chemical traits along gradients of elevation and soil fertility; (ii) strong phylogenetic partitioning of structural and defense chemicals within communities independent of variation in environmental conditions; and (iii) strong environmental control on foliar phosphorus and calcium, the two rock-derived elements limiting CO2 uptake in tropical forests. These findings indicate that the chemical diversity of western Amazonian forests occurs in a regionally nested mosaic driven by long-term chemical trait adjustment of communities to large-scale environmental filters, particularly soils and climate, and is supported by phylogenetic divergence of traits essential to foliar survival under varying environmental conditions. Geographically nested patterns of forest canopy chemical traits will play a role in determining the response and functional rearrangement of western Amazonian ecosystems to changing land use and climate.

AB Aim Pyrogeographical theory suggests that fire is controlled by spatial gradients in resources to burn (fuel amount) and climatic conditions promoting combustion (fuel moisture). Examining trade-offs among these environmental constraints is critical to understanding future fire activity. We evaluate constraints on fire frequency in modern fire records over the entire Mediterranean biome and identify potential shifts in fire activity under an ensemble of global climate projections.
   Location The biome encompassing the Mediterranean-type ecosystems (MTEs).
   Methods We evaluate potential changes in fire over the 21st century in MTEs based on a standardized global framework. Future fire predictions are generated from statistical fire-climate models driven by ensembles of climate projections under the IPCC A2 emissions scenario depicting warmer-drier and warmer-wetter syndromes. We test the hypothesis that MTEs lie in the transition zone discriminating fuel moisture versus fuel amount as the dominant constraint on fire activity.
   Results Fire increases reported in MTEs in recent decades may not continue throughout the century. MTEs occupy a sensitive portion of global fire-climate relationships, especially for precipitation-related variables, leading to highly divergent fire predictions under drier versus wetter syndromes. Warmer-drier conditions could result in decreased fire activity over more than half the Mediterranean biome by 2070-2099, and the opposite is predicted under a warmer-wetter future. MTEs encompass, however, a climate space broad and complex enough to include spatially varied fire responses and potential conversions to non-MTE biomes.
   Main conclusions Our results strongly support the existence of both fuel amount and fuel moisture constraints on fire activity and show their geographically variable influence throughout MTEs. Climatic controls on fire occurrence in MTEs lie close to tipping points', where relatively small changes in future climates could translate into drastic and divergent shifts in fire activity over the Mediterranean biome, mediated by productivity alterations.

AB In the challenge to increase photosynthetic rate per leaf area mathematical models of photosynthesis can be used to help interpret gas exchange measurements made under different environmental conditions and predict underlying photosynthetic biochemistry. To do this successfully it is important to improve the modelling of temperature dependencies of CO2 assimilation and gain better understanding of internal CO2 diffusion limitations. Despite these shortcomings steady-state models of photosynthesis provide simple easy to use tools for thought experiments to explore photosynthetic pathway changes such as redirecting photorespiratory CO2, inserting bicarbonate pumps into C-3 chloroplasts or inserting C-4 photosynthesis into rice. Here a number of models derived from the C-3 model by Farquhar, von Caemmerer and Berry are discussed and compared.

AB Understanding the interactions between the Earth's microbiome and the physical, chemical and biological environment is a fundamental goal of microbial ecology. We describe a bioclimatic modeling approach that leverages artificial neural networks to predict microbial community structure as a function of environmental parameters and microbial interactions. This method was better at predicting observed community structure than were any of several single-species models that do not incorporate biotic interactions. The model was used to interpolate and extrapolate community structure over time with an average Bray-Curtis similarity of 89.7. Additionally, community structure was extrapolated geographically to create the first microbial map derived from single-point observations. This method can be generalized to the many microbial ecosystems for which detailed taxonomic data are currently being generated, providing an observation-based modeling technique for predicting microbial taxonomic structure in ecological studies.

TI Coastal and marine ecosystem services valuation for policy and

SO OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID FUTURE; CLASSIFICATION; ECONOMICS; SUPPORT; VALUES; CARBON; COSTS
AB The recognition of the economic value of nature and the services it provides to humanity has become increasingly essential in the context of coastal zone management. In this paper we review the progress to date on both the necessary conceptual framework and empirical valuation studies required to bolster decision support systems (DSS) targeted at integrated coastal zone management goals. We highlight the importance of using an ecosystem services approach and recommend some basic sequential, although overlapping, analytical steps for appropriate environmental valuation and policy assessment: spatial explicitness; marginal changes; double counting; non-linearities; and threshold effects. We illustrate the practical use of the DSS by reviewing an existing UK case study on managed coastal realignment along the Eastern coast of England, and a new UK case study on managed realignment implemented in a southern area on the same coast. Comparing the two studies, the importance of spatial explicitness and the need for a sequential decision support system when dealing with ecosystem services valuation and project policy appraisal become particularly evident.

AB Current climate change is a major threat to biodiversity. Species unable to adapt or move will face local or global extinction and this is more likely to happen to species with narrow climatic and habitat requirements and limited dispersal abilities, such as amphibians and reptiles. Biodiversity losses are likely to be greatest in global biodiversity hotspots where climate change is fast, such as the Iberian Peninsula. Here we assess the impact of climate change on 37 endemic and nearly endemic herptiles of the Iberian Peninsula by predicting species distributions for three different times into the future (2020, 2050 and 2080) using an ensemble of bioclimatic models and different combinations of species dispersal ability, emission levels and global circulation models. Our results show that species with Atlantic affinities that occur mainly in the North-western Iberian Peninsula have severely reduced future distributions. Up to 13 species may lose their entire potential distribution by 2080. Furthermore, our analysis indicates that the most critical period for the majority of these species will be the next decade. While there is considerable variability between the scenarios, we believe that our results provide a robust relative evaluation of climate change impacts among different species. Future evaluation of the vulnerability of individual species to climate change should account for their adaptive capacity to climate change, including factors such as physiological climate tolerance, geographical range size, local abundance, life cycle, behavioural and phenological adaptability, evolutionary potential and dispersal ability.

AB 1. Methods are needed to relate changing river flows to ecological response, particularly those which do not require collection of extensive new data for river segments that lack historical data. Using time-series of river biomonitoring data from wadeable lowland streams in Denmark and the East Midlands of the U. K., we describe how local-scale habitat features ( indexed through River Habitat Survey or Danish Habitat Quality Survey) and changing river flow ( discharge) influence the response of a macroinvertebrate community index. The approach has broad applicability in developing regional flow-ecological response models.
   2. We analysed the data using multilevel linear regression, combining sample-level and site-level characteristics as predictors. We focused on the potential for common responses across sites; hence for each sample, the macroinvertebrate community was summarised into an index, Lotic Invertebrate index for Flow Evaluation ( LIFE), an average of abundance-weighted flow groups which indicate the microhabitat preferences of each taxon for higher velocities and clean gravel/cobble substrata or slow/still velocities and finer substrata.
   3. For the Danish fauna, the LIFE score responded to three predictors in an additive manner: high flows in the preceding 4 months ( positive), substratum composition and whether the channel was meandering or straight. The East Midlands fauna responded to three predictors: high and low flows in the preceding 6 months ( positive) and the degree of resectioning of the channel ( negative). In both cases, LIFE responded negatively to features associated with historical channel modification. We suggest that there are several mechanisms for these relationships, including the narrower tolerances of taxa preferring high velocity habitat; these taxa are also continually recovering from extreme flow events over an inter-annual timescale.
   4. At the East Midlands sites, there was an interaction between degree of resectioning and antecedent low flow. At sites with a greater extent of resectioning, the LIFE-discharge relationship was also steeper than at less modified sites. Consideration of the underlying data suggests that there are two mechanisms for this response. Firstly, in less modified sites, refugia are present during low flows for taxa preferring higher velocities such as riffle beetles, caseless caddis, mayflies and Gammarus pulex. Secondly, high flows are associated with decreasing abundances of taxa such as molluscs, flatworms and leeches at more resectioned sites, but with stable or increasing abundances at less modified sites.
   5. The LIFE index responded to both antecedent flow and habitat modification in two separate data sets from lowland wadeable streams. This is the first time that the combined importance of these two factors has been demonstrated using routine invertebrate biomonitoring data. These results complement other site-specific studies that have shown how channel structure interacts with flow to create physical habitat, and should assist future work aiming to define flow-habitat-biota relationships.
   6. The derived models may be used to help guide environmental flow allocations, for example by predicting the slope of response of LIFE score to flow for comparable new locations which lack biological data.

AB Ecologists have long realized that stable species richness values can mask rapid turnover in species composition. Because turnover occurs as a consequence of both local and regional processes, understanding the responsible factors provides insight on processes influencing community structure at different scales. Despite the insights to be gained from data on species turnover, they remain relatively uncommon. We present data on the interannual turnover in species composition of larval amphibian communities in 37 ponds over seven years. Species composition of a given pond community was highly dynamic; about half of the species that could be found breeding in a particular pond were actually present in a given year. All species participated in this community turnover, but to different degrees. Using a model selection approach, we show that a statistical model including local environmental factors (pond area, hydroperiod, and canopy cover) and pond connectivity on the landscape provided the best predictions of turnover. Averaged parameter estimates were significant for area, hydroperiod, and connectivity and these same variables were identified by hierarchical partitioning as having significant independent effects on turnover. Area and hydroperiod were negatively related to turnover, whereas connectivity was positively related to turnover. Additionally, the average fraction of years a species was present in a pond was positively correlated with average local population size, but even more strongly correlated with regional population size, suggesting both local and regional influences on turnover. Of the measured biotic factors (biomass of fish, invertebrate predators, anuran and caudate larvae), presence of fish was the only factor that significantly affected rates of turnover. Several mechanism could be responsible for changes in species composition (species extinctions, skipped breeding and movement of choruses), but extinctions appear to be the major cause of turnover. These results have important implications to understanding long-term persistence of species on landscapes and the causes of patterns in species richness on environmental gradients.

AB A novel A-C-i curve (net CO2 assimilation rate of a leaf - A(n) - as a function of its intercellular CO2 concentration - C-i) analysis method (Plant, Cell & Environment 27, 137-153, 2004) was used to estimate the CO2 transfer conductance (g(i)) and the maximal carboxylation (V-cmax) and electron transport (J(max)) potentials of ageing, non-senescing Pseudotsuga menziesii leaves in relation to their nitrogen (N) content and protein and pigment composition. Both g(i) and the stomatal conductance (g(sc)) of leaves were closely coupled to V-cmax, J(max) and A(n) with all variables decreasing with increasing leaf age. Consequently, both C-i and C-c (chloroplastic CO2 concentration) remained largely conserved through successive growing seasons. The N content of leaves, as well as the amount of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) and other sodium dodecyl sulfate-soluble proteins, increased during the first three growing seasons, then stabilized or decreased only slightly afterwards. Thus, the age-related photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency (PNUE) decline of leaves was not a consequence of decreased allocation of N towards Rubisco and other proteins involved in bioenergetics and light harvesting. Rather, loss of photosynthetic capacity was the result of the decreased activation state of Rubisco and proportional down-regulation of electron transport towards the photosynthetic carbon reduction (PCR) and photorespiratory (PCO) cycles in response to a reduction of CO2 supply to the chloroplasts' stroma. This study emphasizes the regulatory potential and homeostaticity of C-c - rather than photosynthetic metabolites or C-i - in relation to the commonly observed correlation between photosynthesis and g(sc).

AB Ecological and genetic studies of marine turtles generally support the hypothesis of natal homing, but leave open the question of the geographical scale of genetic exchange and the capacity of turtles to shift breeding sites. Here we combine analyses of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variation and recapture data to assess the geographical scale of individual breeding populations and the distribution of such populations through Australasia. We conducted multiscale assessments of mtDNA variation among 714 samples from 27 green turtle rookeries and of adult female dispersal among nesting sites in eastern Australia. Many of these rookeries are on shelves that were flooded by rising sea levels less than 10 000 years (c. 450 generations) ago. Analyses of sequence variation among the mtDNA control region revealed 25 haplotypes, and their frequency distributions indicated 17 genetically distinct breeding stocks (Management Units) consisting either of individual rookeries or groups of rookeries in general that are separated by more than 500 km. The population structure inferred from mtDNA was consistent with the scale of movements observed in long-term mark-recapture studies of east Australian rookeries. Phylogenetic analysis of the haplotypes revealed five clades with significant partitioning of sequence diversity (Phi = 68.4) between Pacific Ocean and Southeast Asian/Indian Ocean rookeries. Isolation by distance was indicated for rookeries separated by up to 2000 km but explained only 12% of the genetic structure. The emerging general picture is one of dynamic population structure influenced by the capacity of females to relocate among proximal breeding sites, although this may be conditional on large population sizes as existed historically across this region.

AB The phylogeny of South American spiny rats (Rodentia; Echimyidae) was studied using the exon 28 of the von Willebrand Factor nuclear gene (vWF). Sequences were analysed separately and in combination with a mitochondrial dataset (cyt b, 12S and 16S rRNAs) used in previous publications. The basal polytomy of echimyids was partially resolved and unexpected intergeneric clades were recovered. Thus, the intimate nested position of Myocastor within echimyids is evidenced. A well-supported clade is identified, including all the arboreal genera, and a group formed by Myocastor, Thrichomys, and Proechimys + Hoplomys. The clustering of Euryzygomatomys + Clyomys with Trinomys is also suggested. On the opposite, the phylogenetic position of Capromys as well as the relationships among arboreal genera remain unclear. Molecular divergence times were estimated using a Bayesian relaxed molecular clock and suggest a Middle Miocene origin for most of modern genera. The ecomorphological diversification of echimyids is discussed in the light of these new results and past environmental modifications in South America. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The California Gnatcatcher (Polioptila californica) has become a flagship species in the dispute over development of southern California's unique coastal sage scrub habitat a fragile, geographically restricted ecosystem with high endemism. One aspect of the controversy concerns the status of the subspecies of this bird in southern California coastal sage scrub that is currently listed ns threatened under the U.S. Endangered Species Act. To investigate the recent population history of this species and the genetic distinctiveness of subspecies and to inform conservation planning, we used direct sequencing of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) for 64 individuals from 13 samples taken throughout the species' range. We found that coastal sage scrub populations of California Gnatcatchers are not genetically distinct from populations in Baja California, which are dense and continuously distributed throughout the peninsula. Rather, mtDNA sequences from this species contain the signatures of population growth and support a hypothesis of recent expansion of populations from a southern Baja California refugium northward into the southern coastal regions of California. During this expansion, stochastic events led to a reduction in genetic variation in the newly occupied range. Thus, preservation of coastal sage scrub cannot be linked to maintaining the genetic diversity of northern gnatcatcher populations, despite previous recognition of subspecies Our study suggests that not all currently recognized subspecies are equivalent to evolutionarily significant units and illustrates the danger of focusing conservation efforts for threatened habitats on a single species.

AB Phosphorus deficiency is a major yield limiting constraint in wheat cultivation on acid soils. The plant factors that influence P uptake efficiency (PUPE) are mainly associated with root characteristics. This study was conducted to analyze the genotypic differences and relationships between PUPE, root length density (RLD), colonization by vesicular arbuscular and arbuscular mycorrhizal (V)AM fungi and root excretion of phosphatases in a P-deficient Andisol in the Central Mexican Highlands. Forty-two semidwarf spring-bread-wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) genotypes from CIMMYT were grown without (-P) and with P fertilization (+P), and subsequently in subsets of 30 and 22 genotypes in replicated field trials over 2 and 3 years, respectively. Acid phosphatase activity at the root surface (APASE) was analyzed in accompanying greenhouse experiments in nutrient solution. In this environment, PUPE contributed more than P utilization efficiency, in one experiment almost completely, to the variation of grain yield among genotypes. Late-flowering genotypes were higher yielding, because the postanthesis period of wheat was extended due to the cold weather at the end of the crop cycles, and postanthesis P uptake accounted for 40-45% of total P uptake. PUPE was positively correlated with the numbers of days to anthesis (at -P r=0.57 and at +P r=0.73). The RLD in the upper soil layer (0-20 cm) of the wheat germplasm tested ranged from 0.5 to 2.4 cm cm(-3) at -P and 0.7 to 7.7 at +P. RLD was the most important root trait for improved P absorption, and it was positively genetically correlated with PUPE (at -P r=0.42 and at +P r=0.63) and the number of spikes m(-2) (at -P r=0.58 and at +P r=0.36). RLD in the upper soil layer was more important with P fertilizer application. Without P fertilization, root proliferation in the deeper soil profile secured access to residual, native P in the deeper soil layer. (V)AM-colonisation and APASE were to a lesser degree correlated with PUPE. Among genoptypes, the level of (V)AM-colonisation ranged from 14 to 32% of the RLD in the upper soil layer, and APASE from 0.5 to 1.1 nmol s(-1) plant(-1) 10(-2).

AB DNA sequences from ribosomal genes (rDNA) are the most widely exploited nuclear molecular markers in angiosperm systematics. In concert with various chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) sequences, ribosomal DNA sequences have revolutionised ideas on angiosperm evolution. The utility and popularity of ribosomal genes derives in part from the relative ease with which the sequences can be determined, which in turn derives from the large number of rDNA gene copies in the genome. More importantly, rDNA sequences collectively exhibit a broad range of phylogenetic signal. The relatively slowly-evolving 18S rDNA sequences in combination with the cpDNA genes rbcL and atpB have yielded unequivocal evidence for man: angiosperm interfamilial relationships not predicted from decades of research using non-molecular characters. Sequences from the rapidly evolving rDNA 18S-26S internal transcribed spacers (ITS), currently the most widely exploited molecular marker in angiosperm systematics, have had similar impact on the understanding of interspecific and intergeneric relationships, while also yielding insights on speciation and biogeography. ITS sequences appear to exhibit an unusual property of containing phylogenetic traits specific to many levels of angiosperm divergence, from the most recent to the most ancient. Current research suggests that 26S sequences will became an invaluable source of phylogenetic information spanning the divergence gap between 18S and ITS, while the 18S-26S 5' external transcribed spacer (ETS) will augment greatly the systematic utility of ITS at the lowest taxonomic levels. Sequences from the 5S rDNA non-transcribed spacer (NTS) have proven useful for dissecting origins of hybrid species. Their phylogenetic utility notwithstanding, rDNA sequences exhibit patterns that suggest peculiar evolutionary processes, and these inferred processes must he considered in phylogenetic reconstruction. These patterns include differential levels of homogenisation of rDNA gene copies among both the different gene regions and different rDNA loci within a genome. Incomplete homogenisation of the most rapidly evolving sequences can lead to infragenomic polymorphism, which, if not deterred, can yield incorrect phylogenetic interpretations, rDNA sequences also exhibit strong biases in patterns of substitution among bases and among sequence positions. Moreover, the patterns of bins sometimes appear to differ among members of a particular taxonomic sampling. These biases can mislead popular phylogenetic methods that assume no bias. provided that rDNA evolutionary processes are considered, however, phylogenetic results from rDNA sequences can be as robust as those using any other DNA sequence. Besides facilitating phylogenetic study, the ever-expanding database of angiosperm rDNA sequences contribute to studies of molecular evolution in general and likely will contribute also to advances in the understanding of ribosomal function.

AB Four tributaries of Lake St-Jean (Quebec, Canada) are used for spawning and juvenile habitat by land-locked Atlantic salmon. Spawning runs have drastically declined since the mid-1980s, and consequently, a supportive-breeding programme was undertaken in 1990. In this study, we analysed seven microsatellite loci and mtDNA, and empirically estimated effective population sizes to test the hypotheses that (i) fish spawning in different tributaries form genetically distinct populations and (ii) the supportive breeding programme causes genetic perturbations on wild populations. Allele frequency distribution, molecular variance and genetic distance estimates all supported the hypothesis of genetic differentiation among salmon from different tributaries. Gene flow among some populations was much more restricted than previously reported for anadromous populations despite the small geographical scale (40 km) involved. Both mtDNA and microsatellites revealed a more pronounced differentiation between populations from two tributaries of a single river compared with their differentiation with a population from a neighbouring river. The comparison of wild and F-1-hatchery fish (produced from breeders originating from the same river) indicated significant changes in allele frequencies and losses of low-frequency alleles but no reduction in heterozygosity. Estimates of variance and inbreeding population size indicated that susceptibility to genetic drift and inbreeding in one population increased by twofold after only one generation of supplementation.

AB The slow growth/high mortality hypothesis predicts that herbivorous insects feeding on suboptimal host plants are subjected to higher predation mortality owing to the longer time spent in the vulnerable juvenile stages compared with conspecifics feeding on optimal plants. We tested this hypothesis for the willow-feeding leaf beetle Galerucella lineola raised on one suitable (Salix viminalis) and one unsuitable (S. dasyclados) willow species as well as on plants from an interspecific cross between the two species, Cohorts of larvae raised on caged plants (protected from enemies) and uncaged plants (exposed to enemies) were monitored daily throughout larval development in two consecutive years. Larvae raised on S. viminalis developed faster, grew larger and survived better than those raised on S. dasyclados. The suitability of the hybrid plants was intermediate to that of their parents. Our results strongly support the slow growth/high mortality hypothesis. In both years, total predation during the larval period was higher on S. dasyclados than on S. viminalis. Furthermore, the daily predation rate (i.e. the proportion of larvae preyed upon per day) was higher on S. dasyclados than on S. viminalis. When hybrid plants were included in the analysis total predation was positively correlated with both larval development time and daily predation rate. We suggest that high predation on beetles on low-quality plants is the combined result of their longer development time and elevated daily predation rate. The results are discussed in relation to the evolution of host plant selection and the paradox of sublethal plant defenses.

AB The diet of coral trout Plectropomus leopardus (Serranidae) was studied over a two year period at One Tree Island, Great Barrier Reef, Australia. Rapid visual counts demonstrated that P. leopardus were most abundant on the reef slope habitat and inner edge of the enclosed lagoon. Few P. leopardus were found at sites from "inner" lagoon. It was hypothesized that diet would vary among habitats, times and size classes of coral trout. Ninety-two percent of P. leopardus that contained prey had consumed fish and 87% had only eaten fish. Many types of reef fish were taken by P. leopardus (e.g. Pomacentridae, Scaridae, Blenniidae and Labridae). Most pelagic prey (Clupeidae and Engraulididae) were taken on the reef slope, while some prey were solely or pimarily taken in the lagoon (e.g. Blenniidae and crustaceans). Most pelagic prey were taken on the reef slope in summer by P. leopardus > 250 mm (SL). Plectropomus leopardus (< 200 mm) from the lagoon had a higher proportion of invertebrates in the diet than fish from the reef slope. Plectropomus leopardus of all sizes ate small fish, while largest fish generally consumed largest prey (especially adult scarids and labrids). I argue that interactions among multiple species of prey and predators need more attention, because piscivores may respond to prey in different ways according to habitat type as well as the number and type of other prey types present. Furthermore, different sizes of fish (e.g. coral trout) may impact assemblages of prey in different ways.

AB Research focusing on among-individual differences in behaviour ('animal personality') has been blooming for over a decade. Central theories explaining the maintenance of such behavioural variation posits that individuals expressing greater "risky" behaviours should suffer higher mortality. Here, for the first time, we synthesize the existing empirical evidence for this key prediction. Our results did not support this prediction as there was no directional relationship between riskier behaviour and greater mortality; however there was a significant absolute relationship between behaviour and survival. In total, behaviour explained a significant, but small, portion (5.8%) of the variance in survival. We also found that risky (vs. "shy") behavioural types live significantly longer in the wild, but not in the laboratory. This suggests that individuals expressing risky behaviours might be of overall higher quality but the lack of predation pressure and resource restrictions mask this effect in laboratory environments. Our work demonstrates that individual differences in behaviour explain important differences in survival but not in the direction predicted by theory. Importantly, this suggests that models predicting behaviour to be a mediator of reproduction-survival trade-offs may need revision and/or empiricists may need to reconsider their proxies of risky behaviours when testing such theory.

AB Trait variability in space and time allows plants to adjust to changing environmental conditions. However, we know little about how this variability is distributed and coordinated at different organizational levels. For six dominant tree species in northeastern Spain (three Fagaceae and three Pinaceae) we quantified the inter- and intraspecific variability of a set of traits along a water availability gradient. We measured leaf mass per area (LMA), leaf nitrogen (N) concentration, carbon isotope composition in leaves (delta C-13), stem wood density, the Huber value (Hv, the ratio of cross-sectional sapwood area to leaf area), sapwood-specific and leaf-specific stem hydraulic conductivity, vulnerability to xylem embolism (P-50) and the turgor loss point (P-tlp). Differences between families explained the largest amount of variability for most traits, although intraspecific variability was also relevant. Species occupying wetter sites showed higher N, P-50 and P-tlp, and lower LMA, delta C-13 and Hv. However, when trait relationships with water availability were assessed within species they held only for Hv and P-tlp. Overall, our results indicate that intraspecific adjustments along the water availability gradient relied primarily on changes in resource allocation between sapwood and leaf area and in leaf water relations.

AB Managing the nonlethal effects of disturbance on wildlife populations has been a long-term goal for decision makers, managers, and ecologists, and assessment of these effects is currently required by European Union and United States legislation. However, robust assessment of these effects is challenging. The management of human activities that have nonlethal effects on wildlife is a specific example of a fundamental ecological problem: how to understand the population-level consequences of changes in the behavior or physiology of individual animals that are caused by external stressors. In this study, we review recent applications of a conceptual framework for assessing and predicting these consequences for marine mammal populations. We explore the range of models that can be used to formalize the approach and we identify critical research gaps. We also provide a decision tree that can be used to select the most appropriate model structure given the available data. Synthesis and applications: The implementation of this framework has moved the focus of discussion of the management of nonlethal disturbances on marine mammal populations away from a rhetorical debate about defining negligible impact and toward a quantitative understanding of long-term population-level effects. Here we demonstrate the framework's general applicability to other marine and terrestrial systems and show how it can support integrated modeling of the proximate and ultimate mechanisms that regulate trait-mediated, indirect interactions in ecological communities, that is, the nonconsumptive effects of a predator or stressor on a species' behavior, physiology, or life history.

AB Roughly 3% of the Earth's land surface burns annually, representing a critical exchange of energy and matter between the land and atmosphere via combustion. Fires range from slow smouldering peat fires, to low-intensity surface fires, to intense crown fires, depending on vegetation structure, fuel moisture, prevailing climate, and weather conditions. While the links between biogeochemistry, climate and fire are widely studied within Earth system science, these relationships are also mediated by fuels-namely plants and their litter-that are the product of evolutionary and ecological processes. Fire is a powerful selective force and, over their evolutionary history, plants have evolved traits that both tolerate and promote fire numerous times and across diverse clades. Here we outline a conceptual framework of how plant traits determine the flammability of ecosystems and interact with climate and weather to influence fire regimes. We explore how these evolutionary and ecological processes scale to impact biogeochemical and Earth system processes. Finally, we outline several research challenges that, when resolved, will improve our understanding of the role of plant evolution in mediating the fire feedbacks driving Earth system processes. Understanding current patterns of fire and vegetation, as well as patterns of fire over geological time, requires research that incorporates evolutionary biology, ecology, biogeography, and the biogeosciences.

AB Concerns over the ecological impacts of invasive alien plant species have generated great research interest in understanding the mechanisms that underlie the capacity of such plants to occupy a broad range of habitats. It has been repeatedly suggested that rapid evolution of local adaptation to novel environments may enable invasive plants to occupy a broad range of habitats. However, the classical Darwinian view on evolution by natural selection is that the process is slow and gradual, occurring over thousands of years. Invasive plants typically have a relatively short residence time in their introduced ranges (decades or just a few centuries). Besides the time constraint, founder effects (reduction in population size and genetic diversity) may also limit the capacity of invasive plants to rapidly evolve local adaption. Thus, invasive plants may be less likely than native plants to evolve local adaptation. Interestingly, however, an expanding body of literature documents the existence of local adaptation in invasive plant species within their exotic ranges. Here, we did a phylogenetically controlled meta-analysis to compare invasive and native plant species for differences in the frequency and magnitude of local adaptation. The meta-analysis was based on different experiments performed in various habitats including grasslands, steppes, deserts, forests, mountains, wetlands and dunes, and used a total of 134 plant species in 52 families. Forty seven of these species (in 24 families) are alien invaders in the region where the studies were undertaken, while the other 91 species (in 38 families) are native. On average, local plants performed better than foreign plants, and invasive plant species expressed local adaptation just as frequently, and at least as strongly as that exhibited by native plant species. An analysis performed while taking into account different plant life-history traits showed that self-incompatible invasive plants exhibited significantly higher frequencies of local adaptation than native plants characterized by the same breeding system.Synthesis. The present results support the suggestion that rapid evolution of local adaptation may enable invasive plant species to occupy a broad range of novel habitats.

AB Assessing the impacts of land use and land cover change (LUCC) on regional climate is essential for understanding land-atmosphere interactions and for designing climate adaptation andmitigation strategies. Using the weather research and forecasting (WRF) model, we examined how different land use and land cover patterns affect regional climate in the agro-pastoral transitional zone of North China, whose environmental and socioeconomic conditions are sensitive to climate change. We parameterized WRF using land use and land cover maps corresponding to 2001 and 2010 conditions, which differ in the representation of four land surface biophysical parameters: vegetation fraction, leaf area index (LAI), albedo, and emissivity. From 2001 to 2010, vegetation fraction and LAI increased in summer, emissivity increased and albedo decreased in winter. Our WRF simulations show that differences in land use and land cover patterns led to widespread reduction in summer temperature with local cooling on the order of 1 degrees C, and extensive increase in winter temperature with local warming exceeding 0.8 degrees C. By contrast, simulations using the default landscape representation, provided by WRF itself, show only minor and random changes in temperature. Model evaluation further reveals that our simulations with appropriate land surface properties improve the performance of the WRF model. Our findings demonstrate that LUCC in Northern China has altered the regional climate over the past decade. The magnitude and spatial patterns of temperature changes quantified by our simulations provide useful information for understanding the impacts of LUCC on climate and for developing mitigation and adaptation strategies in arid and semiarid regions.

AB Landscapes are closely linked to human well-being, but they are undergoing rapid and fundamental change. Understanding the societal transformation underlying these landscape changes, as well as the ecological and societal outcomes of landscape transformations across scales are prime areas for landscape research. We review and synthesize findings from six important areas of landscape research in Europe and discuss how these findings may advance the study of ecosystem change and society and its thematic key priorities. These six areas are: (1) linkages between people and the environment in landscapes, (2) landscape structure and land-use intensity, (3) long-term landscape history, (4) driving forces, processes, and actors of landscape change, (5) landscape values and meanings, and (6) landscape stewardship. We propose that these knowledge areas can contribute to the study of ecosystem change and society, considering nested multiscale dynamics of social-ecological systems; the stewardship of these systems and their ecosystem services; and the relationships between ecosystem services, human well-being, wealth, and poverty. Our synthesis highlights that knowledge about past and current landscape patterns, processes, and dynamics provides guidance for developing visions to support the sustainable stewardship of social-ecological systems under future conditions.

AB Understanding recent biogeographic responses to climate change is fundamental for improving our predictions of likely future responses and guiding conservation planning at both local and global scales. Studies of observed biogeographic responses to 20th century climate change have principally examined effects related to ubiquitous increases in temperature - collectively termed a warming fingerprint. Although the importance of changes in other aspects of climate - particularly precipitation and water availability - is widely acknowledged from a theoretical standpoint and supported by paleontological evidence, we lack a practical understanding of how these changes interact with temperature to drive biogeographic responses. Further complicating matters, differences in life history and ecological attributes may lead species to respond differently to the same changes in climate. Here, we examine whether recent biogeographic patterns across California are consistent with a warming fingerprint. We describe how various components of climate have changed regionally in California during the 20th century and review empirical evidence of biogeographic responses to these changes, particularly elevational range shifts. Many responses to climate change do not appear to be consistent with a warming fingerprint, with downslope shifts in elevation being as common as upslope shifts across a number of taxa and many demographic and community responses being inconsistent with upslope shifts. We identify a number of potential direct and indirect mechanisms for these responses, including the influence of aspects of climate change other than temperature (e. g., the shifting seasonal balance of energy and water availability), differences in each taxon's sensitivity to climate change, trophic interactions, and land-use change. Finally, we highlight the need to move beyond a warming fingerprint in studies of biogeographic responses by considering a more multifaceted view of climate, emphasizing local-scale effects, and including a priori knowledge of relevant natural history for the taxa and regions under study.

AB The degradation and loss of vital ecosystem functions and services have been an uncontested result of urbanisation. An understanding of how ecosystem services are provided along rural-urban gradients is crucial in the task of conserving and enhancing vital services in urban environments, increasing the quality of life of urban dwellers, and working towards a sustainable future. Focusing on nine ecosystem services - aesthetic, spiritual, recreation, water flow regulation, carbon sequestration, climate change adaptation, pollination, biodiversity potential, and noise attenuation - regarded as important to urban areas the authors detail the changes in the values of these services along a gradient comprising four categories of urbanisation: urban, suburban, pen-urban and rural, in Greater Manchester, UK. The data on which the discussion is based are derived from an interdisciplinary assessment tool, developed from a selection of previously used assessment methods including the Residential Environment Assessment Tool and the Green Flag Award. Based on a mixture of a field and desktop study, the new tool assigns non-economic values of 0-10 to the selected services, allowing for evaluation of quality between, as well as within, each category of ecosystem service. Trends in the results are discussed, as are drivers for the changes in values along the rural-urban gradient. It is foreseen that this new body of knowledge will allow both practitioners and academics to gain further insight into the provision of ecosystem services along a rural-urban gradient to allow them to tackle the problems associated with them and to optimise open space planning.

AB Aim
   We test how productivity, disturbance rate, plant functional composition and species richness gradients control changes in the composition of high-latitude vegetation during recent climatic warming.
   Location
   Northern Fennoscandia, Europe.
   Methods
   We resampled tree line ecotone vegetation sites sampled 26 years earlier. To quantify compositional changes, we used generalized linear models to test relationships between compositional changes and environmental gradients.
   Results
   Compositional changes in species abundances are positively related to the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)-based estimate of productivity gradient and to geomorphological disturbance. Competitive species in fertile sites show the greatest changes in abundance, opposed to negligible changes in infertile sites. Change in species richness is negatively related to initial richness, whereas geomorphological disturbance has positive effects on change in richness. Few lowland species have moved towards higher elevations.
   Main conclusions
   The sensitivity of vegetation to climate change depends on a complex interplay between productivity, physical and biotic disturbances, plant functional composition and richness. Our results suggest that vegetation on productive sites, such as herb-rich deciduous forests at low altitudes, is more sensitive to climate warming than alpine tundra vegetation where grazing may have strong buffering effects. Geomorphological disturbance promotes vegetation change under climatic warming, whereas high diversity has a stabilizing effect.

AB We have compared the transcriptomic profiles of microdissected live ovules at four developmental stages between a diploid sexual and diploid apomictic Boechera. We sequenced >2 million SuperSAGE tags and identified (1) heterochronic tags (n = 595) that demonstrated significantly different patterns of expression between sexual and apomictic ovules across all developmental stages, (2) stage-specific tags (n = 577) that were found in a single developmental stage and differentially expressed between the sexual and apomictic ovules, and (3) sex-specific (n = 237) and apomixis-specific (n = 1106) tags that were found in all four developmental stages but in only one reproductive mode. Most heterochronic and stage-specific tags were significantly downregulated during early apomictic ovule development, and 110 were associated with reproduction. By contrast, most late stage-specific tags were upregulated in the apomictic ovules, likely the result of increased gene copy number in apomictic (hexaploid) versus sexual (triploid) endosperm or of parthenogenesis. Finally, we show that apomixis-specific gene expression is characterized by a significant overrepresentation of transcription factor activity. We hypothesize that apomeiosis is associated with global downregulation at the megaspore mother cell stage. As the diploid apomict analyzed here is an ancient hybrid, these data are consistent with the postulated link between hybridization and asexuality and provide a hypothesis for multiple evolutionary origins of apomixis in the genus Boechera.

AB 'Who comes first' is decisive for plant community assembly and ecosystem properties. Early arrival or faster initial development of a species leads to space occupancy both above and below ground and contributes to species success. However, regular disturbance (e.g. biomass removal) might permit later-arriving or slower-developing species to catch up.
   Here, artificial communities of grassland species belonging to the plant functional types (PFTs) herb, grass and legume were used to test the effect of stepwise arrival (sowing) of PFTs.
   Dramatic effects were found as a result of a 3 wk arrival difference on composition and above-ground biomass that persisted over four harvests and two seasons. Priority effects, such as unequal germination time (arrival), and thus differences in community age structure, had lasting effects on PFT biomass contribution and associated ecosystem functioning. These effects were robust against above-ground disturbance. Benefits of earlier root formation outweighed above-ground species interaction.
   Earlier space occupancy and bigger reserve pools are the likely causes. Natural populations commonly exhibit age diversity and asynchrony of development among taxa. In experiments, artificial synchrony of arrival (sowing) may thus induce assembly routes favouring faster-establishing taxa, with consequences for ecosystem functioning (e.g. productivity). Founder effects, such as those observed here, could be even greater in communities of slow-growing species or forests, given their longer generation time and minor disturbance.

AB Knowing the geographic extents of species is crucial for understanding the causes of diversity distributions and modes of speciation and extinction. Species geographic ranges are often viewed as approximately constant in size in geological time, even though climate change studies have shown that historical and modern species geographic distributions are not static. Here, we use an extensive global microfossil database to explore the temporal trajectories of geographic extents over the entire lifespan of marine nannoplankton, diatom, planktic foraminifer and radiolarian species. We show that geographic extents are not static over geological time-scales. Temporal trajectories of species geographic ranges are asymmetric: the rise is quicker than the fall. We propose that once a species has overcome its initial difficulties in geographic establishment, it rises to its peak geographic extent. However, once this peak value is reached, it will also have a maximal number of species to interact with. The negative of these biotic interactions could then cause a gradual geographic decline. We discuss the multiple implications of our findings with reference to macroecological and macroevolutionary studies.

AB The determinants of plant species richness and composition of meadows are often mutually related, showing joint effects on plant diversity. Thus, the specific objective of this paper was to evaluate the relative importance of soil, topography, and field management explanatory variables on plant species richness and composition of mown meadows in an area of the Southern Alps. The data consisted of 159 taxa sampled during the summer of 2003 in 56 10 x 10 m(2) sampling plots. For each plot, 25 explanatory variables were recorded. The variation in species richness and composition was divided into the three sets of explanatory variables using a variation partitioning method. Species richness was mostly controlled both by the short-term effect of nitrogen fertilisation, and, as stressed by studies in other landscape contexts in Europe, by the long-term effect of soil phosphorus accumulation. The decrease of plant species number on the most fertile meadows was the consequence of the dominance of few competitors or ruderals, which prevented the establishment of small stress-tolerant species. In contrast to species richness, plant species composition presented an important pure effect of topography (altitude and slope). Species composition depended on several topography, soil, and field management factors. Thus, for both conservation and restoration of species-rich hay meadows, it is necessary to maintain a low level of soil P content, and to prevent the abandonment of parcels on steep slopes and in marginal areas, because these hosted the highest level of plant diversity.

AB The huge ecological and economic impact of biological invasions creates an urgent need for knowledge of traits that make invading species successful and factors helping indigenous populations to resist displacement by invading species or genotypes. High genetic diversity is generally considered to be advantageous in both processes. Combined with sex, it allows rapid evolution and adaptation to changing environments.
   We combined paleogenetic analysis with continent-wide survey of genetic diversity at nuclear and mitochondrial loci to reconstruct the invasion history of a single asexual American water flea clone (hybrid Daphnia pulex X Daphnia pulicaria) in Africa. Within 60 years of the original introduction of this invader, it displaced the genetically diverse, sexual population of native D. pulex in Lake Naivasha (Kenya), despite a formidable numerical advantage of the local population and continuous replenishment from a large dormant egg bank. Currently, the invading clone has spread throughout the range of native African D. pulex, where it appears to be the only occurring genotype.
   The absence of genetic variation did not hamper either the continent-wide establishment of this exotic lineage or the effective displacement of an indigenous and genetically diverse sibling species.

AB The evolutionary potential of a species is determined by its genetic diversity. Thus, management plans should integrate genetic concerns into active conservation efforts. The copper redhorse (Moxostoma hubbsi) is an endangered species, with an endemic distribution limited to the Richelieu River and a short section of the St Lawrence River in Quebec, Canada. The population, gradually fragmented since 1849, is characterized by a decline in population size and a lack of recruitment. A total of 269 samples were collected between 1984 and 2004 and genotyped using 22 microsatellite loci, which indicated that these fish comprise a single population, with a global F(ST) value of only 0.0038. Despite a small census size (similar to 500), a high degree of genetic diversity was observed compared to common values for freshwater fishes (average number of 12.5 alleles/locus and average H(O) of 0.77 +/- 0.08). No difference was observed between expected and observed pairwise values of relatedness (r(xy): -0.00013 +/- 0.11737), suggesting an outbred population. Long-term N(e) was estimated at 4476 whereas contemporary N(e) values ranged from 107 to 568, suggesting a pronounced yet gradual demographic decline of the population, as no bottleneck could be detected for the recent past. By means of simulations, we estimated N(e) would need to remain at more than similar to 400 to retain 90% of the genetic diversity over 100 years. Overall, these observations corroborate other recent empirical studies confirming that long generation times may act as a buffering effect contributing to a reduction in the pace of genetic diversity erosion in threatened species.

AB To reconstruct the phylogenetic position of the extinct cave lion (Panthera leo spelaea), we sequenced 1 kb of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene from two Pleistocene cave lion DNA samples (47 and 32 ky B.P.). Phylogenetic analysis shows that the ancient sequences form a clade that is most closely related to the extant lions from Africa and Asia; at the same time, cave lions appear to be highly distinct from their living relatives. Our data show that these cave lion sequences represent lineages that were isolated from lions in Africa and Asia since their dispersal over Europe about 600 ky B.P., as they are not found among our sample of extant populations. The cave lion lineages presented here went extinct without mitochondrial descendants on other continents. The high sequence divergence in the cytochrome b gene between cave and modern lions is notable. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Although sclerophylly is defined by textural properties, its adaptive significance has been debated without a strong base of mechanical data. We measured a wide range of mechanical properties across a diverse range of species and leaf forms, including highly scleromorphic leaves, and compared these with sclerophylly indices to determine the mechanical properties of sclerophylls.
   Fracture and flexure tests were used to determine leaf strength, toughness (work to fracture) and flexural stiffness ('structural' properties), and specific strength, specific toughness and Young's modulus of elasticity ('material' properties, i.e. normalized per unit leaf thickness).
   Leaves varied considerably in all properties tested, and in the way they combined various 'structural' and 'material' properties. However, on average, highly scleromorphic leaves were stronger, tougher and stiffer than soft leaves. 'Structural' properties correlated more strongly with sclerophylly than 'material' properties, and the ratio of stiffness to strength and toughness increased in sclerophyllous species.
   Of the structural properties, strength, toughness and flexural stiffness each made substantial independent contributions to the variation in sclerophylly indices, but the best individual explanators were flexural stiffness and strength, with the best predictive model being a combination of these two properties. This model should now be tested on leaves from contrasting environments.

AB It has been hypothesized that plants cannot tolerate combined shade and drought, as a result of morphological trade-offs. However, numerous plant species are reportedly widespread in shaded forest understories that face drought, whether seasonal or occasional. We studied juveniles of six plant species that cope with strong summer drought in the understoreys of mixed Quercus forests in southern Spain: the tall-shrubs Phillyrea latifolia and Viburnum tinus, the perennial herb Rubia peregrina, the small shrub Ruscus aculeatus, and climbers Hedera helix and Smilax aspera. All of these species persist in evergreen shade (c. 3% daylight). Two other species were studied as comparators, Ruscus hypoglossum, less tolerant of drought, and Ceratonia siliqua, less tolerant of shade. Morphological and chemical variables relevant to shade and drought tolerance were measured for juveniles in a range of sizes, and also for the leaves of mature plants. The species converge in features that confer tolerance of shade plus drought by reducing demand for resources. Demand for water is reduced through a moderate to high below-ground mass fraction and low to moderate specific leaf area (respectively 0.22-0.52 and 112-172 cm(2) g(-1) at 1.00 g total dry mass). Demand for both irradiance and water is reduced through a low to moderate foliar nitrogen concentration and long-lived, physically protected leaves (greater than or equal to2 yr). The species also converge in features that confer tolerance of either low irradiance or drought through specialized capture of resource, without precluding the other tolerance. These features include deep roots relative to shoot size, moderately higher specific leaf area in shade (1.2-2.0 x that in sun) and higher chlorophyll: nitrogen ratio in shade. Foliar chlorophyll per unit mass was higher in shade, but chlorophyll was not necessarily synthesized in greater amounts; rather, it was higher apparently due to shade effects on structural features linked with specific leaf area. In contrast, N per unit mass was higher in sun leaves independently of specific leaf area. Despite these convergences, the species diverge considerably in their root mass allocation and architecture, leaf saturated water content, density of stomata and guard cell size. No single narrowly defined functional type is needed for tolerance of shade plus drought.

AB 1. Patterns of species richness along latitudinal, elevational and depth gradients often exhibit a mid-gradient peak. Similar patterns with a mid-domain peak in richness are produced, as a result of geometric constraints on species distributions, by models that randomize species range size and placement over a bounded gradient.
   2. Proponents of these so-called mid-domain models argue that they provide an appropriate null hypothesis for examining species richness patterns along spatial gradients. Furthermore, some claim that because these models seem to explain a large proportion of the large-scale spatial variation in richness, geometric constraints on species distribution are in fact the cause of these patterns.
   3. A critical examination of model assumptions reveals that some are unrealistic, conceptually flawed or internally inconsistent. Additionally, tests of mid-domain models have suffered from methodological deficiencies derived from arbitrariness and circularity in the definition of domain boundaries, collapsing two-dimensional (2-D) patterns into a single dimension (1-D), and the use of interpolated ranges, all of which can bias test results in favour of the models. Tests have also been statistically naive by using fairly insensitive measures of deviation between observed and predicted patterns and ignoring the increased probability of Type I error that can result in analyses of spatially autocorrelated data.
   4. In spite of this, a review of the empirical evidence indicates that most studies do not show a high degree of concordance between observed and predicted species richness patterns, particularly in 2-D. Additionally, spatial patterns of variation in range size and species turnover do not unequivocally support mid-domain models. Thus, the models do not adequately describe observed species richness gradients and thus fail to explain them.
   5. Although mid-domain models have served a useful purpose in drawing attention to the need to clarify the null expectation in the study of species richness gradients, their use appears to be severely limited by difficulties associated with the treatment of ranges, boundary definitions and a lack of clarity regarding the extent to which the observed data should be used to generate the null patterns.

AB The phylogeny of Rosoideae was investigated using 44 species. Here we report new sequence data from the chloroplast trnL/F region as well as an increased sample of species. The analysis of these new data, along with previously used data from the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacers (ITS), significantly increased resolution as well as confidence for Rosoideae phylogeny. Using both Bayesian inference and parsimony methods, we conducted analyses on the data sets separately and in combination. The resulting phylogenies are congruent with all well-supported clades of Rosoideae found in previous analyses of ITS or rbcL data. The support for these and other clades is improved, and we consider several clades to be supported well enough to be named. The following clades are given phylogenetic definitions: Sanguisorbeae and its subclades Agrimoniinae and Sanguisorbinae, Potentilleae and its subclades Fragariinae and Potentilla, Roperculina (Rosa + Sanguisorbeae + Potentilleae), and Sanpotina (Sanguisorbeae + Potentilleae). Potentilla includes the Potentilla anserina clade (Argentina) in our trnL/F and combined analyses, but this relationship is not resolved by ITS alone. The previously used genera Duchesnea (Potentilla indica), Horkelia, and Ivesia are strongly supported as nested within Potentilla. Comarum (Potentilla palustris and Potentilla salesowianum), Sibbaldiopsis (Potentilla tridentata), Dasiphora (Potentilla fruticosa), and Drymocallis (Potentilla arguta) join Alchemilla, Aphanes, Sibbaldia, Chamaerhodos, and Fragaria in the well-supported Fragariinae clade outside of Potentilla. The monophyly of both Potentilleae and Sanguisorbeae is well supported, and the clades correspond to previously named tribes with the exception of Alchemilla and its segregate Aphanes, which are nested within Potentilleae instead of in Sanguisorbeae. The position of Rubus is still not securely resolved.

AB Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) seedlings were grown for 50 days in growth chambers in an ambient or twice ambient carbon dioxide concentration ([CO2]) at a day/night temperature of 19/12 degreesC or 23/16 degreesC. Although elevated [CO2] (EC) had only slight effects on the growth parameters measured, elevated temperature (ET) increased aboveground dry mass of both species. Among treatments, biomass accumulation of both species was greatest in the combined EC + ET treatment. The EC treatment induced thylakoid swelling and increased numbers of plastoglobuli observed in Scots pine needles. Although EC had little effect on Rubisco protein or N concentration of needles, ET had a large effect on N-containing compounds and enhanced N allocation from I-year-old needles. Terpenoids were more responsive to EC and ET than total phenolics. Generally, terpene concentrations were reduced by EC and increased by ET. Increased terpenoid concentrations in response to ET might be associated with thermotolerance of photosynthesis. In Norway spruce, EC decreased total phenolic concentrations in needles, probably as a result of increased growth. We conclude that, in seedlings of these boreal species, the effects of elevated [CO2] on the studied parameters were small compared with the effects of elevated temperature.

AB Positive relationships between species richness and ecosystem processes such as productivity or nitrogen cycling can be the result of a number of mechanisms. We examined how species richness, biomass, and legume presence, diversity, and abundance explained nitrogen dynamics in experimental grassland plots in northern Sweden. Nitrogen concentrations and delta(15)N values were measured in plants grown in 28 mixtures (58 plots) including 1, 2, 4, 8 or 12 local grassland species over four years. Values for delta(15)N declined over time for all three functional groups (grasses, legumes, and non-leguminous forbs), suggesting greater reliance on N fixed by legumes over time by all species. Above ground percent nitrogen (%N) also declined over time but root %N and total N did not. Path analysis of above ground data suggested that two main factors affected %N and the size of the N pool. First, higher plant diversity (species richness) increased total N through increased biomass in the plot. Although in the first two years of the experiment this was the result of a greater probability of inclusion of at least one legume, in the last two years diversity had a significant effect on biomass beyond this effect. Second, percent legumes planted in the plots had a strong effect on above ground %N and delta(15)N, but a much smaller effect on above ground biomass. In contrast, greater plant diversity affected N in roots both by increasing biomass and by decreasing %N (after controlling for effects mediated by root biomass and legume biomass). Increased legume biomass resulted in higher %N and lower delta(15)N for both non-legume forbs and grasses in the first year, but only for grasses in the third year. We conclude that a sampling effect (greater probability of including a legume) contributed towards greater biomass and. total N in high-diversity communities early on in the experiment, but that over time this effect weakened and other positive effects of diversity became more important.

AB The last decade has witnessed a growing awareness that fishes can not only be severely overfished but could also be threatened with extinction through over-exploitation. Among commercially important species, those particularly at risk are large and slow to mature, iteroparous and may have sporadic recruitment. The threat of extirpation or extinction may be greater if species are particularly valuable, have a limited geographical range, are part of mixed-species fisheries, or are distributed solely within areas of intense fishing activity. Significantly, there is little empirical or theoretical basis for hypothesizing that highly fecund species are any less at risk than those of low fecundity as is often assumed. Indeed, the use of fecundity in estimating reproductive output in long-lived, highly fecund, pelagic egg-producing species may be deeply flawed. A general resistance to accepting that fecund marine fishes could become endangered through exploitation stems from poor understanding of population dynamics, especially in the early post-settlement phase, coupled with assumptions of fishers models that ignore critical components of life history theory. Moreover, faith in the ability to manage exploited species effectively leads to the perception that severe declines are management. rather than conservation. issues. The growing list of threatened marine species and a realization of the many factors that place them at risk indicate the need to be precautionary about the possibility of extinction. and about the criteria used to assess such risk. with important implications for research. monitoring and Management.

AB Culicoides imicola, a vector of bluetongue virus and African horse sickness virus, is principally Afro-Asian in distribution, but has recently been found in parts of Europe. A logistic regression model based on climate data (temperature, saturation deficit, rainfall and altitude) and the published distribution of C. imicola in Iberia was developed and then applied to other countries in Europe, to identify locations where C. imicola could become established. The model identified three temperature variables as significant determinants of the distribution of C. imicola in Iberia (minimum of the monthly minimum temperatures, maximum of the monthly maximum temperatures and number of months per year with a mean temperature greater than or equal to 12.5 degreesC). The model indicated that under current conditions, the distribution of C. imicola in Spain, Greece and Italy could be extended and the vector could potentially invade parts of Albania, Yugoslavia, Bosnia and Croatia. To simulate the effect of global warming, temperature values in the model were increased by 2 degreesC. Under these conditions, the potential spread of C. imicola in Europe would be even more extensive.

AB The primary objective of this study was to use highly polymorphic microsatellite loci to estimate individual reproductive success in Atlantic salmon based on the number of surviving juveniles (young of the year) at the population level under natural conditions. We inferred reproductive strategies adopted by both sexes by applying a maximum likelihood method to determine parent-offspring genotype relationships. A high degree of variance in individual reproductive success for both males and females was revealed. The high number of mates used by both sexes is not concordant with previous behavioral studies proposing that females are mainly monogamous in this species. We found little evidence supporting the prediction from previous reports of a positive relationship between individual size and realized reproductive success for either males or females. For both sexes, however, there was a significant correlation between the number of mates and the number of offspring. These results indicate that this species' mating system is more flexible than previously thought and suggest that factors such as potential genetic benefits or environmental uncertainty may also be driving the evolution and the plasticity of mating systems in Atlantic salmon.

AB Good management models and good models for understanding biology differ in basic philosophy. Management models must facilitate management decisions despite large amounts of uncertainty about the managed populations. Such models must be based on parameters that can be estimated readily must explicitly account for uncertainty, and should be simple to understand and implement In contrast biological models are designed to elucidate the workings of biology,and should not be constrained by management concerns. We illustrate the need to incorporate uncertainty in management models by reviewing the inadequacy of using standard biological models to manage marine mammals in the United States. Past management was based on a simple model that, although it may have represented population dynamics adequately,failed as a management tool because the parameter that triggered management action was extremely difficult to estimate for the majority of populations. Uncertainty in parameter estimation resulted in few conservation actions We describe a recently adopted management scheme that incorporates uncertainty and its resulting implementation. The approach used in this simple management scheme, which was tested by using simulation models, incorporates uncertainty and mandates monitoring abundance and human-caused mortality. Although the entire scheme may be suitable for application to some terrestrial and marine problems, two features are broadly applicable: the incorporation of uncertainty through simulations of management and the use of quantitative management criteria to translate verbal objectives into levels of acceptable risk.

AB Acclimation by the photosynthetic system to the gradient in irradiance through a leaf canopy was investigated with a plot of lucerne (Medicago sativa L. cv. Aurora). The aims were to determine the extent to which acclimation occurred in a natural canopy and to quantify the changes in the partitioning of nitrogen within the leaf that are associated with acclimation. The canopy grew up around light sensors placed at 10 cm height increments which logged the irradiance at 1 min intervals for the 4 days that preceded sampling. Photosynthetic capacity was measured with leaf disc oxygen electrodes and the chlorophyll, soluble protein and nitrogen contents of the leaves were determined. Daily irradiance declined exponentially down through the canopy. Nitrogen content and photosynthetic capacity both declined down through the canopy. Photosynthetic acclimation by the lower leaves was evident from the lower chlorophyll a/b ratios and reduced photosynthetic capacity per unit chlorophyll. The lower photosynthetic capacity per unit of chlorophyll was offset by an increased proportion of leaf nitrogen present in the thylakoids. Consequently, the photosynthetic capacity per unit leaf nitrogen was nearly independent of irradiance.
   Based on a comparison of the response of many species to different irradiances during growth, it is generally the case that the proportion of thylakoid nitrogen increases for leaves grown under lower irradiance so as to maintain a constant ratio of photosynthetic capacity to total leaf nitrogen. However, the ratio of photosynthetic capacity to total leaf nitrogen varies widely between species.

AB We tested the hypothesis that environmental stresses decrease overall plant resistance to insect herbivory in the field and evaluated biochemical mechanisms proposed to explain insect response to stressed plants. To impose a stress treatment, we severed lateral roots and rhizomes of a native crucifer (bittercress, Cardamine cordifolia) and quantified plant and herbivore responses for treatment and control clones. Severing roots and rhizomes once, early in the growing season: (1) produced moderate, but detectable, changes in plant physiological traits, specifically greater transient leaf water deficits at midday (P < .05) and elevated nitrate-nitrogen concentrations (P < .05); (2) altered plant quality, by causing an increase in soluble carbohydrates (P < .003), isoleucine concentrations in leaves (P < .01), and possibly glucosinolate concentration (P < . 10), but made no differences in most primary nutrient concentrations, including total nitrogen, total free amino nitrogen, total amino acids, proline, and leaf water content; and (3) led to increased herbivory by chewing and leaf-mining (P < .001), but not by sap-feeding, insect herbivores. Trends toward decreased plant stature and fruit reproduction were not significant after 1 mo. In addition to the significant effect of our treatment, we found extensive variation in the magnitude of response to stress and herbivory among replicates. We hypothesize that environmentally induced physiological variation among plants within a plant population commonly distributes insect herbivory disproportionately onto a subset of the individuals, and in so doing influences the demography, distribution, and evolution of that plant population.

Larvae must contact live L. glaciale or its spores for metamorphosis to occur; the inducer is not sensed in the water column. However, aqueous extracts of L. glaciale can induce metamorphosis, suggesting that the inducing factor is chemical. Neither ashed nor boiled L. glaciale induces metamorphosis, indicating that the factor is heat-labile and that thigmotaxis, per se, is not important in the response. The amino-acid, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which induces settlement of other marine invertebrate larvae, also induces significant rates of metamorphosis of S. droebachiensis at concentrations-lesser-than-or-greater-than-10(-4) M. A reduction (with antibiotics) in the number of live bacteria on the surface of L. glaciale does not affect the rate of metamorphosis of larvae.

AB International trade and movement of people are largely responsible for increasing numbers of non-native insect introductions to new environments. For forest insects, trade in live plants and transport of wood packaging material (WPM) are considered the most important pathways facilitating long-distance invasions. These two pathways as well as trade in firewood, logs, and processed wood are commonly associated with insect infestations, while hitchhiking insects can be moved on cargo, in the conveyances used for transport (e.g., containers, ships), or associated with international movement of passengers and mail. Once established in a new country, insects can spread domestically through all of the above pathways. Considerable national and international efforts have been made in recent years to reduce the risk of international movement of plant pests. International Standards for Phytosanitary Measures (ISPMs) No. 15 (WPM), 36 (plants for planting), and 39 (wood) are examples of phytosanitary standards that have been adopted by the International Plant Protection Convention to reduce risks of invasions of forest pests. The implementation of ISPMs by exporting countries is expected to reduce the arrival rate and establishments of new forest pests. However, many challenges remain to reduce pest transportation through international trade, given the ever-increasing volume of traded goods, variations in quarantine procedures between countries, and rapid changes in distribution networks. It is therefore likely that many more human-assisted invasions of forest insects will take place. New geographic expansions by natural modes are also made possible due to changes in host distribution and/or climate.

AB One of the major challenges in ecology is to predict how multiple global environmental changes will affect future ecosystem patterns (e.g. plant community composition) and processes (e.g. nutrient cycling). Here, we highlight arguments for the necessary inclusion of land-use legacies in this endeavour. Alterations in resources and conditions engendered by previous land use, together with influences on plant community processes such as dispersal, selection, drift and speciation, have steered communities and ecosystem functions onto trajectories of change. These trajectories may be modulated by contemporary environmental changes such as climate warming and nitrogen deposition. We performed a literature review which suggests that these potential interactions have rarely been investigated. This crucial oversight is potentially due to an assumption that knowledge of the contemporary state allows accurate projection into the future. Lessons from other complex dynamic systems, and the recent recognition of the importance of previous conditions in explaining contemporary and future ecosystem properties, demand the testing of this assumption. Vegetation resurvey databases across gradients of land use and environmental change, complemented by rigorous experiments, offer a means to test for interactions between land-use legacies and multiple environmental changes. Implementing these tests in the context of a trait-based framework will allow biologists to synthesize compositional and functional ecosystem responses. This will further our understanding of the importance of land-use legacies in determining future ecosystem properties, and soundly inform conservation and restoration management actions.

AB The concept of ecosystem services is becoming increasingly influential in environmental research and policy - reshaping human-environment interactions. In this paper, we trace the rapid growth of ecosystem services across academic disciplines and amongst organizations at the boundary of science and policy. We approach ecosystem services as an evolving discourse and track its evolution across key institutional time frames. The review shows how the concept emerged in the United States as an economic and ecological response to ecosystem degradation, and has since expanded to incorporate a wide array of disciplinary perspectives across multiple countries. A discursive-institutional analysis identifies four key moments when ideas and initiatives from academia and policy became institutionalized. Using a spiral metaphor, we argue such moments shape subsequent research, policy and practice. The foundations of economics and ecology remain dominant, however there are emerging opportunities for other disciplines who have been marginal to this discourse up until now to contribute to what is becoming an increasingly powerful and global concept. We argue that social scientists must become more involved to ensure issues of poverty, justice, equality, differentiated wellbeing, governance, rights, and marginality are to influence the next institutional spiral of this important and influential discourse.

AB Projecting biogeochemical responses to global environmental change requires multi-scaled perspectives that consider organismal diversity, ecosystem processes, and global fluxes. However, microbes, the drivers of soil organic matter decomposition and stabilization, remain notably absent from models used to project carbon (C) cycle-climate feedbacks. We used a microbial trait-based soil C model with two physiologically distinct microbial communities, and evaluate how this model represents soil C storage and response to perturbations. Drawing from the application of functional traits used to model other ecosystems, we incorporate copiotrophic and oligotrophic microbial functional groups in the MIcrobial-MIneral Carbon Stabilization (MIMICS) model; these functional groups are akin to 'gleaner' vs. 'opportunist' plankton in the ocean, or r- vs. K-strategists in plant and animal communities. Here we compare MIMICS to a conventional soil C model, DAYCENT (the daily time-step version of the CENTURY model), in cross-site comparisons of nitrogen (N) enrichment effects on soil C dynamics. MIMICS more accurately simulates C responses to N enrichment; moreover, it raises important hypotheses involving the roles of substrate availability, community-level enzyme induction, and microbial physiological responses in explaining various soil biogeochemical responses to N enrichment. In global-scale analyses, we show that MIMICS projects much slower rates of soil C accumulation than a conventional soil biogeochemistry in response to increasing C inputs with elevated carbon dioxide (CO2) - a finding that would reduce the size of the land C sink estimated by the Earth system. Our findings illustrate that tradeoffs between theory and utility can be overcome to develop soil biogeochemistry models that evaluate and advance our theoretical understanding of microbial dynamics and soil biogeochemical responses to environmental change.

AB Background and Aims Abiotic properties of soil are known to be major drivers of the microbial community within it. Our understanding of how soil microbial properties are related to the functional structure and diversity of plant communities, however, is limited and largely restricted to above-ground plant traits, with the role of below ground traits being poorly understood. This study investigated the relative contributions of soil abiotic properties and plant traits, both above-ground and below-ground, to variations in microbial processes involved in grassland nitrogen turnover.
   Methods In mountain grasslands distributed across three European sites, a correlative approach was used to examine the role of a large range of plant functional traits and soil abiotic factors on microbial variables, including gene abundance of nitrifiers and denitrifiers and their potential activities.
   Key Results Direct effects of soil abiotic parameters were found to have the most significant influence on the microbial groups investigated. Indirect pathways via plant functional traits contributed substantially to explaining the relative abundance of fungi and bacteria and gene abundances of the investigated microbial communities, while they explained little of the variance in microbial activities. Gene abundances of nitrifiers and denitrifiers were most strongly related to below-ground plant traits, suggesting that they were the most relevant traits for explaining variation in community structure and abundances of soil microbes involved in nitrification and denitrification.
   Conclusions The results suggest that consideration of plant traits, and especially below-ground traits, increases our ability to describe variation in the abundances and the functional characteristics of microbial communities in grassland soils.

AB Tropical forests play a significant role in the global carbon cycle and global climate. However, tropical carbon cycling and the feedbacks from tropical ecosystems to the climate system remain critical uncertainties in the current generation of carbon-climate models. One of the major uncertainties comes from the lack of representation of phosphorus (P), currently believed to be the most limiting nutrient in tropical regions. Here we introduce P dynamics and C-N-P interactions into the CLM4-CN (Community Land Model version 4 with prognostic Carbon and Nitrogen) model and investigate the role of P cycling in controlling the productivity of tropical ecosystems. The newly developed CLM-CNP model includes all major biological and geochemical processes controlling P availability in soils and the interactions between C, N, and P cycles. Model simulations at sites along a Hawaiian soil chronosequence indicate that the introduction of P limitation greatly improved the model performance at the P-limited site. The model is also able to capture the shift in nutrient limitation along this chronosequence (from N limited to P limited), as shown in the comparison of model simulated plant responses to fertilization with the observed data. Model simulations at Amazonian forest sites show that CLM-CNP is capable of capturing the overall trend in NPP (net primary production) along the P availability gradient. This comparison also suggests a significant interaction between nutrient limitation and land use history. Model experiments under elevated atmospheric CO2 ([CO2]) conditions suggest that tropical forest responses to increasing [CO2] will interact strongly with changes in the P cycle. We highlight the importance of two feedback pathways (biochemical mineralization and desorption of secondary mineral P) that can significantly affect P availability and determine the extent of P limitation in tropical forests under elevated [CO2]. Field experiments with elevated CO2 are therefore needed to help quantify these important feedbacks. CO2 doubling model experiments show that tropical forest response to elevated [CO2] can only be predicted if the interactions between C cycle and nutrient dynamics are well understood and represented in models. Predictive modeling of C-nutrient interactions will have important implications for the prediction of future carbon uptake and storage in tropical ecosystems and global climate change.

AB In temperate ecosystems, acidic forest soils are among the most nutrient-poor terrestrial environments. In this context, the long-term differentiation of the forest soils into horizons may impact the assembly and the functions of the soil microbial communities. To gain a more comprehensive understanding of the ecology and functional potentials of these microbial communities, a suite of analyses including comparative metagenomics was applied on independent soil samples from a spruce plantation (Breuil-Chenue, France). The objectives were to assess whether the decreasing nutrient bioavailability and pH variations that naturally occurs between the organic and mineral horizons affects the soil microbial functional biodiversity. The 14 Gbp of pyrosequencing and Illumina sequences generated in this study revealed complex microbial communities dominated by bacteria. Detailed analyses showed that the organic soil horizon was significantly enriched in sequences related to Bacteria, Chordata, Arthropoda and Ascomycota. On the contrary the mineral horizon was significantly enriched in sequences related to Archaea. Our analyses also highlighted that the microbial communities inhabiting the two soil horizons differed significantly in their functional potentials according to functional assays and MG-RAST analyses, suggesting a functional specialisation of these microbial communities. Consistent with this specialisation, our shotgun metagenomic approach revealed a significant increase in the relative abundance of sequences related glycoside hydrolases in the organic horizon compared to the mineral horizon that was significantly enriched in glycoside transferases. This functional stratification according to the soil horizon was also confirmed by a significant correlation between the functional assays performed in this study and the functional metagenomic analyses. Together, our results suggest that the soil stratification and particularly the soil resource availability impact the functional diversity and to a lesser extent the taxonomic diversity of the bacterial communities.

AB Irrespective of which side is taken in the densification-sprawl debate, insights into the relationship between urban green space coverage and urbanization have been recognized as essential for guiding sustainable urban development. However, knowledge of the relationships between socio-economic variables of urbanization and long-term green space change is still limited. In this paper, using simple regression, hierarchical partitioning and multi-regression, the temporal trend in green space coverage and its relationship with urbanization were investigated using data from 286 cities between 1989 and 2009, covering all provinces in mainland China with the exception of Tibet. We found that: [1] average green space coverage of cities investigated increased steadily from 17.0% in 1989 to 373% in 2009; [2] cities with higher recent green space coverage also had relatively higher green space coverage historically; [3] cities in the same region exhibited similar long-term trends in green space coverage; [4] eight of the nine variables characterizing urbanization showed a significant positive linear relationship with green space coverage, with 'per capita GDP' having the highest independent contribution (242%); [5] among the climatic and geographic factors investigated, only mean elevation showed a significant effect; and [6] using the seven largest contributing individual factors, a linear model to predict variance in green space coverage was constructed. Here, we demonstrated that green space coverage in built-up areas tended to reflect the effects of urbanization rather than those of climatic or geographic factors. Quantification of the urbanization effects and the characteristics of green space development in China may provide a valuable reference for research into the processes of urban sprawl and its relationship with green space change.

AB Most impacts on providing ecosystem services (ESs) are related to land use changes that may cause ecosystem fragmentation and loss of ecosystem functions. Spatial planning, focusing on sustainable landscape development, should consider the local potential for providing ESs as well possible impacts due to land use changes. The results of a large number of recent studies on ES assessment are difficult to replicate and integrate into landscape planning or definition of land use policies. The time and resource constraints, needed in data gathering and analysis, limit local administrations in the concern about ES.
   Extending the approach of spatially explicit benefit transfer, we present an expert-based estimation of land use potential in providing ES. We enhanced ES estimations related to different land use classes (in terms of (sic)/ha year) by considering "local conditions" such as elevation and distance from urban areas, assuming these spatial characteristics can affect ES provisioning. The adaptation for "local conditions" was performed through expert consultation, using Delphi survey and focus groups, involving 46 experts from 10 Italian research institutions. In detail, we used land cover maps for 1990 and 2000, and aggregated the results on the province scale. The results show spatial pattern of gains and losses in ES values for Italian provinces. The province level of aggregation seems to be effective for dealing with strategic phase of spatial planning. By eliciting possible consequences of land use changes, this knowledge framework may foster strategies for sustainable landscape planning and management. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB P>1. Biological invasions, still occurring worldwide at an alarming rate, are widely acknowledged as threats to the integrity and functioning of ecosystems. In addition to introducing disease, biological invasions have also been linked to sudden increases in the incidence or severity of previously existing diseases. We review and illustrate the potential direct and indirect impacts of introduced species on the dynamics of endemic parasites in freshwater ecosystems.
   2. Introduced species may trigger and sustain disease emergence by acting as competent hosts for endemic parasites in which infection is amplified and then 'spilled back' to native hosts. In contrast, if introduced species are not suitable hosts for endemic parasites but become infected anyway, they may act as sinks for parasites and thus dilute disease risk for native hosts.
   3. Another mechanism by which introduced species can influence endemic parasitic diseases is by altering the relative abundance of one of the parasite's hosts in ways that could either enhance or reduce disease transmission to other native hosts in the parasite's life cycle.
   4. Introduced species may also alter disease incidence and severity in native hosts through trait-mediated indirect effects. For example, the introduced species could change the exposure or susceptibility of native hosts to infection by causing alterations in their behaviour or immunocompetence. Also, by directly changing physicochemical conditions and modifying environmental stressors introduced species may indirectly affect native host exposure and/or resistance to disease.
   5. A survey of parasites infecting introduced freshwater fish in four distinct geographical areas revealed that use of non-indigenous hosts by endemic parasites is widespread, mostly involving parasites transmitted via the food chain.
   6. We conclude by presenting a framework, based on risk assessment, for the prediction and possible mitigation of the impact of introduced species on endemic diseases and by calling for greater recognition of the potential role of invasive species as triggers of endemic disease emergence.

AB The ability to generate large molecular datasets for phylogenetic studies benefits biologists, but such data expansion introduces numerous analytical problems. A typical molecular phylogenetic study implicitly assumes that sequences evolve under stationary, reversible and homogeneous conditions, but this assumption is often violated in real datasets. When an analysis of large molecular datasets results in unexpected relationships, it often reflects violation of phylogenetic assumptions, rather than a correct phylogeny. Molecular evolutionary phenomena such as base compositional heterogeneity and among-site rate variation are known to affect phylogenetic inference, resulting in incorrect phylogenetic relationships. The ability of methods to overcome such bias has not been measured on real and complex datasets. We investigated how base compositional heterogeneity and among-site rate variation affect phylogenetic inference in the context of a mitochondrial genome phylogeny of the insect order Coleoptera. We show statistically that our dataset is affected by base compositional heterogeneity regardless of how the data are partitioned or recoded. Among-site rate variation is shown by comparing topologies generated using models of evolution with and without a rate variation parameter in a Bayesian framework. When compared for their effectiveness in dealing with systematic bias, standard phylogenetic methods tend to perform poorly, and parsimony without any data transformation performs worst. Two methods designed specifically to overcome systematic bias, LogDet and a Bayesian method implementing variable composition vectors, can overcome some level of base compositional heterogeneity, but are still affected by among-site rate variation. A large degree of variation in both noise and phylogenetic signal among all three codon positions is observed. We caution and argue that more data exploration is imperative, especially when many genes are included in an analysis.

AB Long-term data are needed to assess spatial and temporal variability of communities and their resilience to natural and anthropogenic disturbances, particularly in climatic regions marked by high interannual variability (e.g. mediterranean-climate). A long-term study at four sites on two streams in mediterranean-climate California (annual sampling over 20 yr) allowed us to quantify the influence of a 5-yr prolonged drought on stream invertebrate and fish communities. Invertebrate community composition did not show recovery following drought. The primary environmental factors influencing community composition, identified through principle components and multiple correspondence analyses were precipitation and flow permanence. Invertebrate taxon richness and abundance exhibited few responses (some site specific) and recovered quickly. Native fish abundance was lowest during the drought period and highest during the wet years that occurred at the end of the study period. Importantly, the prolonged drought facilitated the establishment and success of the invasive green sunfish (Centrarchidae: Lepomis cyanellus) that was then resilient to subsequent large flow events. There was high spatial synchrony in the temporal changes among all four sites, and three distinct periods were identified: early drought, late drought, and post-drought years. However, we still found differences among sites along the flow permanence gradient from temporary to perennial in the response to drought of both invertebrate and fish assemblages likely as a result of changes in substrate, vegetation, and other habitat characteristics. The observed lack of resilience and negative impacts to biodiversity due to prolonged drought associated with long-term habitat changes is important because hydroclimatic extremes are predicted to increase in frequency and magnitude with global climate change.

AB The discovery of deep-sea hydrothermal vent fauna, kilometres deep in the oceans, is a great achievement of 20th-century marine biology. The deep-sea hydrothermal food web does not directly depend on the sun's energy. Vent communities rely primarily on trophic associations between chemoautotrophic bacteria and consumers A small. number of endemic taxa are adapted to the inhospitable vent environments that are distributed along ridge crests. Where these vent communities originated and how they dispersed are among the important questions ecologists must answer. Here, by statistical analysis of the most comprehensive database ever assembled about deep-sea hydrothermal fauna, we delineate six major hydrothermal provinces in the world ocean and identify seven possible dispersal pathways between adjacent provinces. Our model suggests that the East-Pacific Rise may have played a pivotal role as a centre of dispersal for the hydrothermal fauna. Our data-driven conclusion will have to be tested by phylogenetic studies and completed by surveys of less-explored fields. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Genetic variation is considered critical for allowing natural populations to adapt to their changing environment, and yet the effects of human disturbance on genetic variation in the wild are poorly understood. Different types of human disturbances may genetically impact natural populations in a predictable manner and so the aim of this study was to provide an overview of these changes using a quantitative literature review approach. I examined both allozyme and microsatellite estimates of genetic variation from peer-reviewed journals, using the mean number of alleles per locus and expected heterozygosity as standardized metrics. Populations within each study were categorized according to the type of human disturbance experienced ("hunting/harvest", "habitat fragmentation", or "pollution"), and taxon-specific, as well as time- and context-dependent disturbance effects were considered. I found that human disturbances are associated with weak, but consistent changes in neutral genetic variation within natural populations. The direction of change was dependent on the type of human disturbance experienced, with some forms of anthropogenic challenges consistently decreasing genetic variation from background patterns (e.g., habitat fragmentation), whereas others had no effect (e.g., hunting/harvest) or even slightly increased genetic variation (e.g., pollution). These same measures appeared sensitive to both the time of origin and duration of the disturbance as well. This suggests that the presence or absence, strength, type, as well as the spatial and temporal scale of human disturbance experienced may warrant careful consideration when conservation management plans are formulated for natural populations, with particular attention paid to the effects of habitat fragmentation.

AB We manipulated the number of saprotrophic fungi in either a complex multi-resource substratum (sterilized forest soil), or a single-resource substratum (powdered cellulose). The substrates were inoculated with five common species of soil fungi in all possible combinations (from monocultures to five species in combination). In both substrates, the rate of organic matter decomposition was positively associated with species richness. The effect of fungal diversity was much stronger in the uniform single-resource substrate (r(2) = 0.455, P < 0.0001) than in soil (r(2) = 0.154, P < 0.0001). The results document that species richness of microbial decomposers strongly affects decomposition processes, at least at the species poor end of the diversity gradient. Both, 'sampling effect' and 'species complementarity effect' contributed to the community response with the latter being much more pronounced in uniform substrate than in soil. This indicates that facilitative interactions are more important than resource partitioning for positive effects of species richness.

AB Human activities are impacting coral reefs physically, biologically, and chemically. Nutrification, sedimentation, chemical pollution, and overfishing are significant local threats that are occurring worldwide. Ozone depletion and global warming are triggering mass coral-bleaching events; corals under temperature stress lose the ability to synthesize protective sunscreens and become more sensitive to sunlight. Photo-oxidative stress also reduces fitness, rendering reef-building organisms more susceptible to emerging diseases. Increasing concentration of atmospheric CO2 has already reduced CaCO3 saturation in surface waters by more than 10%. Doubling of atmospheric CO2 concentration over pre-industrial concentration in the 21st century may reduce carbonate production in tropical shallow marine environments by as much as 80%.
   As shallow-water reefs decline worldwide, opportunities abound for researchers to expand understanding of carbonate depositional systems. Coordinated studies of carbonate geochemistry with photozoan physiology and calcification, particularly in cool subtropical-transition zones between photozoan-reef and heterotrophic carbonate-ramp communities, will contribute to understanding of carbonate sedimentation under environmental change, both in the future and in the geologic record. Cyanobacteria are becoming increasingly prominent on declining reefs, as these microbes can tolerate strong solar radiation, higher temperatures, and abundant nutrients. The responses of reef-dwelling cyanobacteria to environmental parameters associated with global change are prime topics for further research, with both ecological and geological implications.

AB 1. Abundance trends provide key guidance when setting conservation priorities, whether indicating population decline, stability or recovery. Knowledge of the power of surveys to detect trends is essential, as the consequences of not detecting a real trend can be profound.
   2. Unfortunately, some surveys have been established with no assessment of power, and others are used to study species that were not their original focus. The latter is common in the marine environment, where rare fish are monitored using catch data from surveys that target more abundant commercially fished species.
   3. We calculated the power of a large-scale annual monitoring survey (the English North Sea bottom trawl survey) to detect decline and recovery of species that are vulnerable to fishing. As fisheries exploitation invariably precedes scientific investigation, the survey began after many vulnerable species had already been depleted.
   4. The power of the survey to detect declines in the abundance of vulnerable species on time scales of < 10 years was low and the survey often failed to detect declines that would lead to listings under the IUCN A1 Red List criteria. Thus conservation prioritization based solely on survey data may fail to identify species at risk of regional extinction.
   5. If conservation measures were effective, and vulnerable populations recovered at the maximum potential rate, 5-10 years of monitoring would often be required to detect recovery.
   6. Power to detect trends in abundance was increased by developing a composite indicator that reflected trends in abundance of several vulnerable species. This indicator provided an overview of their conservation status.
   7. Synthesis and applications. Consistent with the precautionary principle, conservation prioritization and management action should not depend on the statistical significance of recent abundance trends when low power is a consequence of historical depletion. If the conservation prioritization and management of rare and/or vulnerable species have to be predicated on evidence of significant declines, then higher type 1 error rates (falsely detecting a decline) should be acceptable. This is because the costs of type 1 errors are lower than those of type 2 (failure to detect a real decline).

AB Demographically open communities are often viewed as stochastically structured assemblages because most colonizing juveniles arrive via unpredictable dispersal mechanisms. However, interactions between established residents and incoming juveniles may affect juvenile persistence in species-specific ways and could therefore impose a degree of determinism on future Community structure.
   Using 16 spatially isolated communities of, coral reef fishes, I conducted two experiments to determine how prior residency by two guilds of fishes affected juvenile recruitment. Each experiment factorially manipulated the presence and absence of two guilds: resident piscivores (groupers and moray eels) and interference competitors (territorial damselfishes).
   In the first experiment, guilds were manipulated via selective removals, and subsequent recruitment (larval settlement minus mortality) was monitored for 44 days. In the second experiment, guilds Were placed within large cages to prevent direct resident-juvenile interactions, while allowing for any cues produced by enclosed fishes, thereby testing whether incoming larvae used resident-derived cues to select or reject settlement sites. Colonizing juveniles were collected from each reef over 42 days to prevent confounding resident- and recruit-derived cues. In the first experiment, piscivores inhibited recruitment of a damselfish (Pomacentridae) and a surgeonfish (Acanthuridae), and enhanced recruitment of a wrasse (Labridae). In contrast, territorial damselfishes inhibited recruitment of the damselfish and the wrasse, and enhanced recruitment of the surgeonfish. Observations of early recruitment patterns suggested that recruitment differences were established rapidly during the night or dawn periods shortly after settlement and before each daily census. In the second experiment, there was no evidence that larvae used resident-derived cues to select settlement sites, suggesting that recruitment differences in the first experiment resulted from differential mortality caused by direct resident-recruit interactions rather than differential larval settlement.
   These results demonstrate that interactions between established residents and newly arrived juveniles can have a strong influence on juvenile persistence, and that such interactions appear to be strongest within hours of larval, settlement. Furthermore, because resident effects were species specific, the present composition of these communities may impose a previously undocumented degree of determinism on their future structure.

AB 1. In the deserts of the south-western United States of America, as in many ecoregions around the world, invasion of non-native plants is modifying the structure and composition of riparian vegetation.
   2. Restoration of native plant species frequently proves to be ecologically and economically difficult. In the Muddy River drainage in the Mojave Desert (Nevada, USA), eradication of one the most aggressive invasive plants, Tamarix ramosissima (salt-cedar), often reduces the structural and compositional diversity of the remaining vegetation. This can have negative effects on native animals, including birds.
   3. The objectives of our work were (i) to examine relationships between avian diversity and measures of vegetational diversity (species richness, dominance of non-native plants and vegetation structure [total vegetation volume]), (ii) to explore the extent to which avian community composition was associated with vegetation composition (floristics) or vegetation structure (physiognomy), and (iii) to consider the potential effects of alternative land management and ecological restoration strategies on the biodiversity of birds and other native fauna in watersheds in the arid south-western USA.
   4. Species richness of all birds and of breeding birds was best modelled by total vegetation volume alone. Neither species richness of plants nor dominance of non-native plants had a statistically significant effect on species richness, abundance or evenness of birds.
   5. Species composition of birds between sites was more similar when floristics was more similar, and vice versa. Species composition of birds was not correlated with physiognomy.
   6. Species richness of native birds in the Muddy River drainage appears not to suffer from invasion of non-native plants, provided that the vegetational community retains sufficient structural diversity.
   7. The composition of the bird community is closely related to floristics, and other taxonomic groups may exhibit different responses to vegetation structure and composition. Therefore, explicit strategies for landscape-scale management, restoration and maximization of native faunal diversity should consider how removal of invasive plants may affect physiognomy and floristics of the vegetational community as a whole.

AB Recent studies in terrestrial, plant-dominated systems have shown that reductions in diversity can affect essential ecosystem processes, especially productivity. however, the exact form of the relationship between diversity and ecosystem functions remains unknown, as does the relevance of these studies to other systems. We studied the relationships between macroinvertebrate species richness and ecosystem functions in a soft-bottom, intertidal system. We also considered, as a separate variable, the effects of macro invertebrate biomass on ecosystem functions. A field experiment was conducted at Blackness, a mudflat in the Firth of Forth, Scotland, United Kingdom, using cages with different mesh sizes (195, 300, and 3000 mum) to establish low, medium, and high species richness treatments through differential colonization of defaunated sediments. Low, medium, and high biomass treatments were established by enclosing differing amounts of ambient sediment in defaunated plots. Other treatments controlled for the effects of defaunation and caging. The experiment ran for six weeks in the summer of 1999. All treatments contained species within the same five main functional groups of macroinvertebrate, but species' identity varied both within and between treatments (thus species richness was considered a random, rather than fixed, variable). A total of 27 macroinvertebrate species were sampled across all treatments; 37% of these occurred in the low, 52% in the medium, and 74% in the high diversity treatments.
   At the end of the experiment, the following physical variables were measured as indicators of ecosystem functions such as sediment stabilization and nutrient fluxes: sediment shear strength (a measure of sediment cohesiveness), water content, silt/clay content, organic content, redox potential (a measure of anoxia), nitrate, nitrite, phosphate and ammonium fluxes, and community respiration. Changes in biomass. and species richness were found to have significant effects on oxygen consumption; these relationships were driven in particular by the presence of the largest species in our study, Nephtys hombergii. All other variables were not significantly affected by the treatments. These results support the null hypotheses of no relationship between ecosystem functions and diversity and biomass.. However, our experiment was necessarily limited in both spatial and temporal scale; the implications of this when scaling up to larger. scale generalizations are discussed. Our results suggest that diversity/biomass/ecosystem function relationships in the soft sediment benthos are likely to be very complex and may depend more on functional groups than species richness.

AB Increasing evidence suggests that climate change has consequences on avian breeding phenology. Here, variations in laying date and clutch size of great tit Parus major and blue tit Parus caeruleus within and between breeding populations through the western Palaearctic are examined in relation to climatic fluctuations, measured by the winter North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index. Within and across breeding sites, laying date was related to winter-NAO index such that great and blue tit females lay earlier after warmer, moister winters (positive values of winter NAO-index). The present study shows that for most populations there is an advancement of laying date, but the rate of change with respect to NAO significantly differed geographically across the western Palaearctic and did not differ between species. However, clutch size of great and blue tits was not affected by climatic fluctuations, presumably because the whole season is being shifted, but not in relation to food supplies. These combined analyses for the two species controlled for potentially confounding variables such as latitude, longitude, elevation and habitat of each study site.

AB Photosynthetic acclimation of deciduous broadleaved tree species was studied along a vertical gradient within the canopy of a multi-species deciduous forest in northern Japan. We investigated variations in (1) local light regime and CO2 concentration ([CO2]), and (2) morphological (area, thickness and area per mass), biochemical (nitrogen and chlorophyll concentrations) and physiological (light-saturated photosynthetic rate) attributes of leaves of seven major species on three occasions (June, August and October). We studied early successional species, alder (Alnus hirsuta (Spach) Rupr.) and birch (Betula platyphylla var. japonica (Miq.) Hara); gap phase species, walnut (Juglans ailanthifolia Carriere) and ash (Fraxinus mandshurica var. japonica Rupr.); mid-successional species, basswood (Tilia japonica (Miq.) Simonk.) and elm (Ulmus davidiana var. japonica (Rehd.) Nakai); and the late-successional species, maple (Acer mono Bunge). All but maple initiated leaf unfolding from the lower part of the crown. The [CO2] within the vertical profile ranged from 320-350 ppm in the upper canopy to 405-560 ppm near the ground. The lowest and highest ambient [CO2] occured during the day and during the night, respectively. This trend was observed consistently during the summer, but not when trees were leafless. Chlorophyll concentration was positively related to maximum photosynthetic rate within, but not among, species. Leaf senescence started from the inner part of the crown in alder and birch, but started either in the outer or top portion of the canopy of ash, basswood and maple. Chlorophyll (Chl) to nitrogen ratio in leaves increased with decreasing photon flux density. However, Chl b concentration in all species remained stable until the beginning of leaf senescence. Maximum photosynthetic rates observed in sun leaves of early successional species, gap phase or mid-successional species, and late successional species were 12.5-14.8 mu mol m-(2) s(-1), 4.1-7.8 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) and 3.1 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), respectively.

AB Polar benthic communities are subject to a range of disturbance levels from a variety of sources, principal amongst which is ice. This occurs in four main forms: the ice-foot, ice scour, anchor ice and fast ice, each of which influences benthos in a very different temporal and spatial manner. The four described forms of ice disturbance are all seasonal, but combined, influence communities throughout the year. The magnitude of ice mediated disturbance is often catastrophic and as a result both dominates benthic community structure and makes recolonization and development rates critical. This disturbance extremity results in high temporal and spatial heterogeneity very low intertidal zone diversity and in places low mid-sublittoral diversity It may also, however, be important in generating and maintaining thr typically high sublittoral zone diversity observed at many polar localities. Intermediate frequencies or magnitudes of disturbance have been controversially discussed as important in maintaining diversity by prevention of space monopolization by overgrowth dominants in such environments as the deep sea. The shelf areas examined to date certainly suggest intermediate disturbance is important in maintaining polar sublittoral zone diversity The combination of slow colonization and development with high frequencies of disturbance means most polar nearshore environments that hal-e been described are permanently in a state of change or recovery.

AB Climate shapes geographic and seasonal patterns in global fire activity by mediating vegetation composition, productivity, and desiccation in conjunction with land-use and anthropogenic factors. Yet, the degree to which climate variability affects interannual variability in burned area across Earth is less understood. Two decades of satellite-derived burned area records across forested and nonforested areas were used to examine global interannual climate-fire relationships at ecoregion scales. Measures of fuel aridity exhibited strong positive correlations with forested burned area, with weaker relationships in climatologically drier regions. By contrast, cumulative precipitation antecedent to the fire season exhibited positive correlations to nonforested burned area, with stronger relationships in climatologically drier regions. Climate variability explained roughly one-third of the interannual variability in burned area across global ecoregions. These results highlight the importance of climate variability in enabling fire activity globally, but also identify regions where anthropogenic and other influences may facilitate weaker relationships. Empirical fire modeling efforts can complement process-based global fire models to elucidate how fire activity is likely to change amidst complex interactions among climatic, vegetation, and human factors.

AB Soils represent a significant reservoir of biological diversity that underpins a broad range of key processes and moderate ecosystem service provision. Our understanding of the role that soil organisms play in ecosystems is still developing, but the increased investigation into biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships in soils over the past couple of decades has provided insights that have greatly enhanced our ability to sustainably manage soil biodiversity. In this review, we synthesize emerging knowledge of soil biodiversity as a natural resource that supports the functioning of terrestrial ecosystems and their delivery of ecosystem services. We explore how environmental changes alter soil biodiversity and how this in turn can affect ecosystem processes as well as resistance and resilience to environmental changes. We then discuss ways to include soil biodiversity in management strategies for sustainable production and biodiversity conservation. We conclude by highlighting key research challenges to further improve our knowledge of soil biodiversity and its management.

AB Disentangling the mechanisms mediating the coexistence of habitat specialists and generalists has been a long-standing subject of investigation. However, the roles of species traits and environmental and spatial factors have not been assessed in a unifying theoretical framework. Theory suggests that specialist species are more competitive in natural communities. However, empirical work has shown that specialist species are declining worldwide due to habitat loss and fragmentation. We addressed the question of the coexistence of specialist and generalist species with a spatially explicit metacommunity model in continuous and heterogeneous environments. We characterized how species' dispersal abilities, the number of interacting species, environmental spatial autocorrelation, and disturbance impact community composition. Our results demonstrated that species' dispersal ability and the number of interacting species had a drastic influence on the composition of metacommunities. More specialized species coexisted when species had large dispersal abilities and when the number of interacting species was high. Disturbance selected against highly specialized species, whereas environmental spatial autocorrelation had a marginal impact. Interestingly, species richness and niche breadth were mainly positively correlated at the community scale but were negatively correlated at the metacommunity scale. Numerous diversely specialized species can thus coexist, but both species' intrinsic traits and environmental factors interact to shape the specialization signatures of communities at both the local and global scales.

AB This paper tests the steps required to transform a theoretical natural capital/ecosystem service framework for soils into an operational model. Each of the services provided by a volcanic soil under a pastoral dairy use are quantified and valued. The six guiding principles underpinning the method developed include differentiating soil services from supporting processes; identifying key soil properties and processes behind each service; distinguishing natural capital from added/built capital; identifying how external drivers affect natural capital stocks; analysing the impact of degradation processes on soil properties and basing the economic valuation on measured proxies. Proxies to quantify ecosystem services focus on the part played by soil in generating each service. This new approach highlights the importance of soil change in quantifying services, and goes beyond simply determining the status of soil natural capital. The total value of the ecosystem services provided by a volcanic soil under dairy in the Waikato region in New Zealand was estimated at $16,390/ha/year on average over 35 consecutive years. The services with the highest value were the filtering of nutrients and contaminants (58-63% of total value), followed by the provision of food and then flood mitigation. Regulating services had an economic value 2.5 times more important than provisioning services. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Coral loss and declines in the physical structure of reef habitats have marked effects on the abundance of coral reef fishes which will be become even more pronounced as coral cover continues to decline. Further, changes in the abundance and composition of fish assemblages may have consequences for ecosystem function and fisheries productivity. Even if fisheries species are generally resilient to habitat degradation, harvesting of larger fishes may threaten ecosystem functions that are critical to coral reef resilience. Ultimately, managers will need to explicitly address conflicts between increasing demand for fish and the need to maintain ecosystem services.

AB The structure of coral reef habitat has a pronounced influence on the diversity, composition and abundance of reef-associated fishes. However, the particular features of the habitat that are most critical are not always known. Coral habitats can vary in many characteristics, notably live coral cover, topographic complexity and coral diversity, but the relative effects of these habitat characteristics are often not distinguished. Here, we investigate the strength of the relationships between these habitat features and local fish diversity, abundance and community structure in the lagoon of Lizard Island, Great Barrier Reef. In a spatial comparison using sixty-six 2m(2) quadrats, fish species richness, total abundance and community structure were examined in relation to a wide range of habitat variables, including topographic complexity, habitat diversity, coral diversity, coral species richness, hard coral cover, branching coral cover and the cover of corymbose corals. Fish species richness and total abundance were strongly associated with coral species richness and cover, but only weakly associated with topographic complexity. Regression tree analysis showed that coral species richness accounted for most of the variation in fish species richness (63.6%), while hard coral cover explained more variation in total fish abundance (17.4%), than any other variable. In contrast, topographic complexity accounted for little spatial variation in reef fish assemblages. In degrading coral reef environments, the potential effects of loss of coral cover and topographic complexity are often emphasized, but these findings suggest that reduced coral biodiversity may ultimately have an equal, or greater, impact on reef-associated fish communities.

AB Burkholderia comprises more than 60 species of environmental, clinical, and agro-biotechnological relevance. Previous phylogenetic analyses of 16S rRNA, recA, gyrB, rpoB, and acdS gene sequences as well as genome sequence comparisons of different Burkholderia species have revealed two major species clusters. In this study, we undertook a multilocus sequence analysis of 77 type and reference strains of Burkholderia using atpD, gltB, lepA, and recA genes in combination with the 16S rRNA gene sequence and employed maximum likelihood and neighbor-joining criteria to test this further. The phylogenetic analysis revealed, with high supporting values, distinct lineages within the genus Burkholderia. The two large groups were named A and B, whereas the B. rhizoxinica/B. endofungorum, and B. andropogonis groups consisted of two and one species, respectively. The group A encompasses several plant-associated and saprophytic bacterial species. The group B comprises the B. cepacia complex (opportunistic human pathogens), the B. pseudomallei subgroup, which includes both human and animal pathogens, and an assemblage of plant pathogenic species. The distinct lineages present in Burkholderia suggest that each group might represent a different genus. However, it will be necessary to analyze the full set of Burkholderia species and explore whether enough phenotypic features exist among the different clusters to propose that these groups should be considered separate genera.

AB The concept of ecosystem services introduced a new view on the relationship between biodiversity and human well being. But are both concepts, biodiversity and ecosystem services, mutually beneficial? We will try to unravel part of this much debated question in three steps.
   Firstly, a general hypothesis describing the present link between biodiversity, ecosystem services and land use intensity is tested for the region of Flanders (13.682 km(2)). The spatial exercise illustrates that even in a densely populated area as Flanders (539 inhabitants/km(2)), scores for biodiversity and ecosystem services show a clear decline with an increase in land use intensity. Despite the overall congruence of the rough indicators of biodiversity and ecosystem services used in this exercise, the need for new indicators integrating key structural and functional aspects of the ecosystem is highlighted.
   In a second step a target scheme is proposed describing the relation between biodiversity and land use intensity, for the long-term future. In this conceptual framework the need for the conservation and restoration of biodiversity hot spots is emphasized. At the same time the importance of the search for an environmental 'bottom line' is stressed. What is the minimum amount of biodiversity needed to reach sustainable use? And what is the critical point for human impact beyond which society will largely depend on the import of ecosystem services to sustain or increase its well-being?
   In a third step, ecosystem management is used as a concept to bridge the gap between the present and the target scheme. Ecosystem management is divided into three focal zones. (1) For the remaining zones with a high biodiversity and a low intensity of land use, a biodiversity conservation based approach is needed. (2) For most rural areas with multifunctional uses and a good state as a future perspective, a focus on ecosystem services is a good point of departure. (3) In the built-up areas and intensively used agricultural sites, beyond the minimum standards for land use intensity, a technological service based approach will be necessary.
   A division of ecosystem management into these three zones confirms the complementarity of biodiversity and ecosystem services for policy and management strategies. The concept of this triple division can help to facilitate the discussion of a joint achievement of the goals for biodiversity and ecosystem services in the field. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The phylogeny and taxonomy of mammalian species were originally based upon shared or derived morphological characteristics. However, genetic analyses have more recently played an increasingly important role in confirming existing or establishing often radically different mammalian groupings and phylogenies. The two most commonly used genetic loci in species identification are the cytochrome oxidase I gene (COI) and the cytochrome b gene (cyt b). For the first time this study provides a detailed comparison of the effectiveness of these two loci in reconstructing the phylogeny of mammals at different levels of the taxonomic hierarchy in order to provide a basis for standardizing methodologies in the future. Interspecific and intraspecific variation is assessed and for the first time, to our knowledge, statistical confidence is applied to sequence comparisons. Comparison of the DNA sequences of 217 mammalian species reveals that cyt b more accurately reconstructs their phylogeny and known relationships between species based on other molecular and morphological analyses at Super Order, Order, Family and generic levels. Cyt b correctly assigned 95.85% of mammal species to Super Order, 94.31% to Order and 98.16% to Family compared to 78.34%, 93.36% and 96.93% respectively for COI. Cyt b also gives better resolution when separating species based on sequence data. Using a Kimura 2-parameter p-distance (x100) threshold of 1.5-2.5, cyt b gives a better resolution for separating species with a lower false positive rate and higher positive predictive value than those of COI.

AB We analyzed fisher interview data collected in the Raja Ampat archipelago of Eastern Indonesia to demonstrate a perceived decline in the abundance of living marine resources targeted by commercial and artisanal fisheries. The decline appeared ubiquitous among all tested species and a clear trend emerged in which older fishers recall greater past abundance than younger fishers. This provides evidence for the shifting baseline syndrome, a dangerous cognitive condition in which each generation of fishery stakeholders accepts a lower standard of resource abundance as normal. We used a fuzzy expert system to standardize and quantify the anecdotal evidence, and combine it with additional depletion indicators to produce a decadal time series of resource abundance from 1970 to present. Using governmental catch-per-unit-effort data from more recent years we hindcasted to establish an absolute scale with which to interpret the perceived decline. The interview information suggested that some exploited species may have declined by as much as an order of magnitude since 1970. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB 1. Refugia are critical to the persistence of individuals, populations and communities in disturbed environments, yet few studies have considered how the position of refugia within the landscape interacts with the behavioural responses of component species to determine the influence of disturbance events on mobile animals.
   2. An 18-month quantitative electrofishing survey was undertaken on the Selwyn River, a stream that is intermittent in its middle reaches, to determine how the direction and distance to refugia affect the response of fish populations to drying, and how landscape context interacts with flow permanence to produce spatial patterns in communities.
   3. Overall, the propensity of fish to take refuge in perennial reaches during drying episodes, and the rate and extent of recolonization from these refugia upon rewetting, depended upon the direction and distance to refugia and the behaviour of component species.
   4. In the upper river, Canterbury galaxias (Galaxias vulgaris), upland bullies (Gobiomorphus breviceps) and brown trout (Salmo trutta) migrated upstream to permanent water as the stream dried from the bottom up, but frequent drying and slow recolonization by most species combined to produce a fish community in intermittent reaches that was quantitatively and qualitatively different to that in neighbouring perennial reaches.
   5. In the lower river, fish did not appear to migrate downstream to permanent water as the stream dried from the top down, but a lower frequency of drying episodes and faster recolonization by upland bullies and eels (Anguilla spp.) from downstream refugia allowed the fish community in intermittent reaches to converge with that in neighbouring perennial reaches during prolonged wetted periods.
   6. Longitudinal patterns of increasing fish density and species richness with flow permanence are interpreted as the product of species-specific responses to drying events and the spatial position of refugia within the riverscape.

AB Reduced genetic variation at marker loci in small populations has been well documented, whereas the relationship between quantitative genetic variation and population size has attracted little empirical investigation. Here we demonstrate that both neutral and quantitative genetic variation are reduced in small populations of a fragmented plant metapopulation, and that both drift and selective change are enhanced in small populations. Measures of neutral genetic differentiation (F-ST) and quantitative genetic differentiation (Q(ST)) in two traits were higher among small demes, and Q(ST) between small populations exceeded that expected from drift alone. This suggests that fragmented populations experience both enhanced genetic drift and divergent selection on phenotypic traits, and that drift affects variation in both neutral markers and quantitative traits. These results highlight the need to integrate natural selection into conservation genetic theory, and suggests that small populations may represent reservoirs of genetic variation adaptive within a wide range of environments.

AB 1. Flow variation can drive major abiotic changes in stream environments between seasons. Theoretically, disparate biotic communities could be maintained during different seasons at a single site if suitable refuges and colonist sources were available. Using isolated montane desert streams in south-east Arizona as a model system, we hypothesised that two disparate aquatic insect faunas (montane temperate and neotropical) could be maintained at the same sites through strong seasonal variation in abiotic conditions.
   2. We collected aquatic insects representing 59 families from seven streams during high-flow (March-April) and low-flow (June) sampling periods across two years. We assessed changes in aquatic insect community and functional feeding group composition by habitat (riffle, pool) and season (high flow, low flow).
   3. Within sites, wetted stream area decreased by an average of 97% between high-flow (predominately riffles) and low-flow (predominately pools) seasons. Community composition likewise showed strong seasonal patterns; the montane temperate fauna was strongly associated with the high-flow season while neotropical hemipterans and coleopterans were associated with the low-flow season. Increased water temperature was significantly associated with this shift from temperate to neotropical assemblages.
   4. Functional feeding group composition shifted dramatically by season. The proportion of predators increased from 24.5% (high flow) to 75.2% (low flow) while collector-filterers and shredders declined from 38.4% (high flow) to 1.7% (low flow).
   5. We suggest that habitat 'time-sharing' by disparate communities is facilitated via strong seasonal variation in temperature and flow and the presence of high elevation refuges or diapause stages for temperate montane taxa to survive the dry season.

AB In response to the scarcity of tools to make quantitative forecasts of the loss of aquatic species from anthropogenic effects, we present a statistical model that relates fish species richness to river discharge. Fish richness increases logarithmically with discharge, an index of habitat space, similar to a species-area curve in terrestrial systems. We apply the species-discharge model as a forecasting tool to build scenarios of changes in riverine fish richness from climate change, water consumption, and other anthropogenic drivers that reduce river discharge. Using hypothetical reductions in discharges (of magnitudes that have been observed in other rivers), we predict that reductions of 20-90% in discharge would result in losses of 2-38% of the fish species in two biogeographical regions in the United States (Lower Ohio-Upper Mississippi and Southeastern). Additional data on the occurrence of specific species relative to specific discharge regimes suggests that fishes found exclusively in high discharge environments (e.g., Shovelnose sturgeon) would be most vulnerable to reductions in discharge. Lag times in species extinctions after discharge reduction provide a window of opportunity for conservation efforts. Applications of the species-discharge model can help prioritize such management efforts among species and rivers.

AB Stomatal density, anatomy and nutrient concentrations of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) needles were studied during 3 years of growth at elevated CO2 (693 +/- 30 mu mol mol(-1)), at elevated temperature (ambient +2.8-6.2 degrees C depending on the time of the year) and in a combination of elevated CO2 and temperature in closed-top chambers. The treatments were started in August 1996. At elevated temperature, the needles that were grown in the first year (i.e. the 1997 cohort) were thinner, had thinner mesophyll in the abaxial side, thinner vascular cylinder and lower stomatal density than those grown at ambient temperature. The proportion of mesophyll area occupied by vascular cylinder or intercellular spaces were not changed. Lower stomatal density apparently did not lead to decreased use of water, as these needles had higher concentrations of less mobile nutrients (Ca, Mg, B, Zn and Mn), which could indicate increased total transpiration. In the 1997 and 1998 cohorts, elevation of temperature decreased concentrations of N, P, K, S and Cu. In the 1999 cohort, contradictory, higher concentrations of N and S at elevated temperature may be related to increased nutrient mineralization in the soil. Elevation of CO2 did not affect stomatal density, needle thickness, thickness of epidermis or hypodermis, vascular cylinder or intercellular spaces. Concentrations of N, P, S and Cu decreased at elevated CO2. Reductions were transient and most distinct in the 1997 cohort. The effects of CO2 and temperature were in some cases interactive, which meant that in the combined treatment stomatal density decreased less than at elevated temperature, and concentrations of nutrients decreased less than expected on the basis of separate treatments, whereas the thickness of the epidermis and hypodermis decreased more than in the separate treatments. In conclusion, alterations in the anatomy and stomatal density of Scots pine needles were more distinct at elevated temperature than at elevated CO2. Both elevated CO2 and temperature-induced changes in nutrient concentrations that partly corresponded to the biochemical and photosynthetic alterations in the same cohorts (Luomala et al. Plant, Cell and Environment26, 645-660, 2003) Reductions in nutrient concentrations and alterations in the anatomy were transient and more evident in the needle cohort that was grown in the first treatment year.

AB We tested the biological cause of density-dependent mortality in the bridled goby (Coryphopterus glaucofraenum), a small coral reef fish, and evaluated whether this knowledge allowed us to detect density dependence at different spatial scales in natural habitats. To identify the biological cause of density dependence, we manipulated both population density and the availability of shelter (crevices used as refuges from predators) in small plots of continuous reef. We detected strong density-dependent mortality in plots with few refuges, but mortality was density independent in plots with abundant refuges, indicating that limited shelter causes density dependence. Predator density was unrelated to the density of gobies and refuges, suggesting that predators displayed a type III functional response in patches with few refuges. In a second experiment, we manipulated goby density within replicate plots of three sizes (4, 16, and 64 m(2)) that varied naturally in the availability of refuges. If refuge availability was ignored, mortality appeared to be density independent at all scales. If, however, plots were grouped by refuge availability, mortality was density dependent in plots with few refuges, but low and density independent in plots with many refuges at all spatial scales. Understanding the mechanism of density dependence (refuge shortage) was thus required to measure the strength of density dependence in natural, spatially variable, habitat. We suggest that density dependence was detectable in plots of different sizes because the relationships between the densities of gobies, refuges, and goby predators were similar across the spatial scales we studied. Our work demonstrates that identifying the biological interactions that cause density dependence, and characterizing the spatial domains at which those interactions operate, will be important to accurately assess the effects of density dependence on population dynamics.

AB Morphological and photosynthetic acclimation of current-year needles to canopy gradients in light availability (seasonal mean integrated quantum flux density, Q(int)) was studied in the temperate conifer, Pinus sylvestris L., at two sites of contrasting nutrient availability. The nutrient-rich site supported a monospecific P. sylvestris stand on an old-field. The trees were approximately 30 years old and 19-21 m tall. Mean foliar N and P contents (+/- SD) were 1.53 +/- 0.11 % and 0.196 +/- 0.017%, respectively. The nutrient-poor site was located on a raised bog supporting a sparse stand of 50- to 100-year-old trees, with a height of 1-2 m, and mean needle N and P contents of 0.86 +/- 0.12% and 0.074 +/- 0.010%, respectively. At both sites, needle thickness (T) and width (W) increased with increasing Q(int), and leaf dry mass per unit leaf area (M-A) was also greater at higher irradiance. The light effects on M-A-the product of needle density (D) and volume to total area ratio (V/A(T))-resulted primarily from large increases in V/A(T) with Q(int) rather than from modifications of D, which was relatively insensitive to light. Although needle morphology versus light relationships were qualitatively similar at both sites, needles were shorter, and the slopes of W, T, M-A and V/A(T) versus light relationships were lower, at the nutrient-poor than at the nutrient-rich site, indicating that the plasticity of foliar morphological characteristics was affected by nutrient availability. As a result of lower plasticity, needles at the nutrient-poor site were narrower, thinner, and had lower MA at high irradiance than needles at the nutrient-rich site. The maximum carboxylase activity of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (V-cmax) and the maximum photosynthetic electron transport rate (J(max)) scaled positively with foliar N and P contents. The correlations were generally stronger with P than with N, suggesting that needle photosynthetic capacity was more heavily limited by the availability of P than of N. The J(max)/V-cmax ratio was positively related to the foliar P/N ratio, indicating that J(max) was more strongly suppressed than V-cmax under conditions of low P availability. Phosphorus and N deficiency also limited the plasticity of foliar photosynthetic characteristics. There was a moderate increase in needle photosynthetic capacity of up to 1.6-fold from the bottom to the top of the canopy at the nutrient-rich site, but net assimilation rates were essentially independent of canopy position at the nutrient-poor site. Stomatal constraints on photosynthesis were similar between the sites, indicating that photosynthetic acclimation was curtailed at the biochemical level. We conclude that the foliar capacity for morphological and physiological acclimation to high light significantly decreases with decreasing nutrient availability in P. sylvestris, and that both N and P availability are potentially important determinants of foliar carbon gain capacities.

AB Ongoing debate about proper interpretation of DNA sequence polymorphisms and their ability to reconstruct human population history illustrates a important change in perspective that we have achieved in the past 20 years of population genetics. To what extent does the history of a Locus represent the history of a population? Tools originally developed for molecular systematics, where genetic Lineages have been separated by speciation events, are routinely applied to the analysis of variation within our species, with conflicting results. Because of automated technologies and linkage analysis, we are poised to harvest a wealth of information about our past, if we are successful in moving beyond a current polarization regarding models of human evolution. Rather than just suggesting that true resolution will only come by considering fossil or archaeological evidence, the realistic and appropriate application of genetic models for analysis of population structure is also necessary. Three examples from different dispersal events are highlighted here.

AB Balancing selection maintains high levels of polymorphism and heterozygosity in genes of the MHC (major histocompatibility complex) of vertebrate organisms, and promotes long evolutionary persistence of individual alleles and strongly differentiated allelic lineages. In this study, genetic variation at the MHC class II DAB-beta1 locus was examined in 31 populations of sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) inhabiting the Fraser River drainage of British Columbia, Canada. Twenty-five percent of variation at the locus was partitioned among sockeye populations, as compared with 5% at neutral genetic markers. Geographic heterogeneity of balancing selection was detected among four regions in the Fraser River drainage and among lake systems within regions. High levels of beta1 allelic diversity and heterozygosity, as well as distributions of alleles and allelic lineages that were more even than expected for a neutral locus, indicated the presence of balancing selection in populations throughout much of the interior Fraser drainage. However, proximate populations in the upper Fraser region, and four of six populations from the lower Fraser drainage, exhibited much lower levels of genetic diversity and had beta1 allele frequency distributions in conformance with those expected for a neutral locus, or a locus under directional selection. Pairwise FST values for beta1 averaged 0.19 and tended to exceed the corresponding values estimated for neutral loci at all levels of population structure, although they were lower among populations experiencing balancing selection than among other populations. The apparent heterogeneity in selection resulted in strong genetic differentiation between geographically proximate populations with and without detectable levels of balancing selection, in stark contrast to observations at neutral loci. The strong partitioning and complex structure of beta1 diversity within and among sockeye populations on a small geographic scale illustrates the value of incorporating adaptive variation into conservation planning for the species.

AB Information on overlap in resource use is central to understanding of interspecific exploitation competition and resource partitioning. Despite this, measures of diet overlap among northern ruminants in Fennoscandia is limited to one earlier study (reindeer and sheep). Diet overlap between sympatric moose and roe deer calculated with Schoener's index was 20.7% and 33.6% during summer (data from one area) and winter (data from two areas), respectively, whereas average diet overlap between moose and red deer was 32.0% during winter (data from four areas). Diet overlap between a coastal island population of red deer and sheep was 59.3% during summer and 63.9% during winter. Summer diet overlap between a sheep and a goat population and a sheep and a reindeer population calculated with data on main types of forage plants was 77.0% and 55.1%, respectively. However, overlap calculated with main plant groups was sometimes considerably higher than when calculated for individual forage species. Neither difference in feeding type nor body mass successfully predicted diet overlap between species pairs (n=9), although there tended to be negative correlation (r(p)=-0.586, P=0.098) between diet overlap of main plant groups (calculated across studies) and difference in feeding type.

AB We investigated the response of spring wheat and oilseed rape to nitrogen (N) supply, focusing on the critical period for grain number definition and grain filling. Crops were grown in containers under a shelter and treated with five combinations of applied N. Wheat and oilseed rape produced comparable amounts of biomass and yield when corrected for the costs of biomass synthesis (SC). From the responses of biomass and yield to late N applications and the apparent contribution of mobilised biomass to yield, it seems that the yield of oilseed rape was more source-limited during grain filling than that of wheat, particularly at the medium and high N levels. Both species recovered equal amounts of N from the total available N in the soil and had similar N use efficiencies, expressed as yield per unit of N absorbed. However, oilseed rape had higher efficiency to convert absorbed N in biomass, but lower harvest index of N than wheat. Oilseed rape had similar or lower root biomass than wheat, depending on N level, but higher root length per unit soil volume and specific root length. The specific uptake rate of N per unit root dry weight during the critical period for grain number determination was higher in oilseed rape than in wheat. In wheat, N limitation affected growth through a similar or lower reduction in radiation use efficiency corrected for synthesis costs (RUESC) than in the cumulative amount of intercepted photosynthetically active radiation (IPARc). In oilseed rape, lower growth due to N shortage was associated more with RUESC than IPARc, during flowering while during grain filling both components contributed similarly to decreased growth. RUESC and the concentration of N in leaves and inflorescence (LIN%) decreased from flowering to maturity and were curvilinearly related. Oilseed rape tended to have higher RUESC than wheat at high N supply during the critical period for grain number determination, and generally lower during grain filling. The reasons for these differences and possibilities to increase yield potential are discussed in terms of the photosynthetic efficiency of the different organs and changes in source-sink ratio during reproductive stages.

AB Possible impacts and mechanisms of response by Australian rodents to fire are identified and discussed in relation to the literature. Although there is considerable information on patterns of population response, there is little concerning the effect of fire on individual behaviour, mortality, or interactions at the community level. The evidence that links observed responses of rodents to habitat variables is largely correlative, and theories on mechanisms of recovery are often simplified or speculative. Experimental manipulations of resources, competitive interactions and predation rates are proposed as the best way to clarify which factors are most influential upon individuals, populations and communities in the post-fire environment.

AB When the rate variation among sites is described by a gamma distribution, an important problem is how to estimate the shape parameter alpha, which is an index of the degree of among-site rate variation. The parsimony-based methods for estimating alpha are simple but biased, i.e., alpha tends to be overestimated. On the other hand, the likelihood-based methods are asymptotically unbiased but take a huge amount of computational time. In this paper, we have developed a new method to solve this problem: we first estimate the expected number of substitutions at each site, which is corrected for multiple hits, and then estimate the parameter alpha. Our method is computationally as fast as the parsimony method, and the estimation accuracy is much higehr than that of parsimony and similar to that of the likelihood method.

AB Distinct gender-associated mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) lineages (i.e., lineages which are transmitted either through males or through females) have been demonstrated in two families of bivalves, the Mytilidae (marine mussels) and the Unionidae (freshwater mussels), which have been separated for more than 400 Myr. The mode of transmission of these M (for male-transmitted) and F (for female-transmitted) molecules has been referred to as doubly uniparental inheritance (DUI), in contrast to standard maternal inheritance (SMI), which is the norm in animals. A previous study suggested that at least three distinct origins of DUI are required to explain the phylogenetic pattern of M and F lineages in freshwater and marine mussels. Here we present phylogenetic evidence based on partial sequences of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene and the 16S RNA gene that indicates that DUI is a dynamic phenomenon. Specifically, we demonstrate that F lineages in three species of Mytilus mussels, M. edulis, M, trossulus, and M. californianus, have spawned separate lineages which are now associated only with males. This process is referred to as ''masculinization'' of F mtDNA. By extension, we propose that DUI may be a primitive bivalve character and that periodic masculinization events combined with extinction of previously existing M types effectively reset the time of divergence between conspecific gender-associated mtDNA lineages.

AB We measured adult density, settlement, post-settlement survival, recruitment success, predation risk and growth rate of the cunner Tautogolabrus adspersus in 4 distinct habitat types (rocky reef, cobble, seagrass and sand) in St. Margaret's Bay, Nova Scotia, Canada. Settlement was not affected by habitat type or by adult density. Post-settlement survival, recruitment success (defined as the density of juveniles present after an arbitrary period following settlement) and adult density varied with habitat and were positively correlated with habitat complexity. This pattern was diametrically opposed to the pattern of predation risk, which was negatively correlated with habitat complexity. Growth of juvenile cunner differed between habitats but was unrelated to habitat complexity. Since the initial pattern of settlement was dramatically altered within a very short time, we concluded that habitat-mediated post-settlement processes play an important role in the population dynamics of cunner. The results of this study demonstrate the importance of habitat in determining growth rates, rates of post-settlement mortality and recruitment success.

AB Norms of reaction for a number of growth and reproductive characters were determined for 15 randomly sampled Polygonum persicaria genotypes, from two natural populations originating in sites with very different nutrient availabilities. Under severely limiting nutrient conditions, these genotypes shared not only plastic responses such as increased root-to-shoot ratio, but a surprising constancy in such functionally essential characters as leaf area ratio, leaf nitrogen concentration, and propagule nitrogen content. Because functional homeostasis depends on flexibility in underlying characters, similar homeostatic results can be achieved through different combinations of underlying plastic and fixed responses in genetically different entities. For example, plants in each population maintained a relatively constant propagule nitrogen content under extreme low-nitrogen conditions by varying either the size or the tissue nitrogen concentration of propagules. These genotypes also tolerated excessive nutrient levels toxic to many plants, evidently by storing excess nutrients in shoots. Although development was altered under such circumstances, reproductive fitness was maintained.
   Genotypes of both populations thus were universally able to tolerate very limited as well as excessive nutrient supplies and to exploit favorable nutrient conditions. This capacity of individual genotypes to accommodate diverse nutrient environments reflects the specific nature of mineral resources and of plant physiology: because nutrient availability can be manipulated via root-system adjustments and facultative uptake mechanisms, and ions can be differentially allocated and translocated among plant parts, nutrient supply may be to a considerable extent mediated by the plant individual. The results further suggest that the response mechanisms conferring ecological breadth for nutrient environment may entail neither physiological costs nor fitness trade-offs, conditions favoring the evolution of plasticity rather than genetic specialization. The evolution of such plasticity also reflects the highly variable nutrient environment plants experience, because of fluctuations not only in soil minerals but in complex interacting factors such as moisture.
   General conclusions based on the entire, three-part study follow the discussion.

AB A classic problem in population genetics is the characterization of discrete population structure in the presence of continuous patterns of genetic differentiation. Especially when sampling is discontinuous, the use of clustering or assignment methods may incorrectly ascribe differentiation due to continuous processes (e.g., geographic isolation by distance) to discrete processes, such as geographic, ecological, or reproductive barriers between populations. This reflects a shortcoming of current methods for inferring and visualizing population structure when applied to genetic data deriving from geographically distributed populations. Here, we present a statistical framework for the simultaneous inference of continuous and discrete patterns of population structure. The method estimates ancestry proportions for each sample from a set of two-dimensional population layers, and, within each layer, estimates a rate at which relatedness decays with distance. This thereby explicitly addresses the "clines versus clusters" problem in modeling population genetic variation, and remedies some of the overfitting to which nonspatial models are prone. The method produces useful descriptions of structure in genetic relatedness in situations where separated, geographically distributed populations interact, as after a range expansion or secondary contact. We demonstrate the utility of this approach using simulations and by applying it to empirical datasets of poplars and black bears in North America.

AB Analysis of anchored hybrid enrichment (AHE) data under a variety of analytical parameters for a broadly representative sample of taxa (136 species representing all extant families) recovered a well-resolved and strongly supported tree for the higher phylogeny of Neuropterida that is highly concordant with previous estimates based on DNA sequence data. Important conclusions include: Megaloptera is sister to Neuroptera; Coniopterygidae is sister to all other lacewings; Osmylidae, Nevrorthidae and Sisyridae are recovered as a monophyletic Osmyloidea, and Rhachiberothidae and Berothidae were recovered within a paraphyletic Mantispidae. Contrary to previous studies, Chrysopidae and Hemerobiidae were not recovered as sister families and morphological similarities between larvae of both families supporting this assumption are reinterpreted as symplesiomorphies. Relationships among myrmeleontoid families are similar to recent studies except Ithonidae are placed as sister to Nymphidae. Notably, Ascalaphidae render Myrmeleontidae paraphyletic, again calling into question the status of Ascalaphidae as a separate family. Using statistical binning of partitioned loci based on a branch-length proxy, we found that the diversity of phylogenetic signal across partitions was minimal from the slowest to the fastest evolving loci and varied little over time. Ancestral character-state reconstruction of the sclerotization of the gular region in the larval head found that although it is present in Coleoptera, Raphidioptera and Megaloptera, it is lost early in lacewing evolution and then regained twice as a nonhomologous gula-like sclerite in distantly related clades. Reconstruction of the ancestral larval habitat also indicates that the ancestral neuropteridan larva was aquatic, regardless of the assumed condition (i.e., aquatic or terrestrial) of the outgroup (Coleopterida).

AB Much ecosystem service (ES) research is structured around four often implicit assumptions about ES, benefits, and stakeholders' conceptions of these: 1) ES assessors can identify and characterize priority ES across stakeholders without local participation; 2) Stakeholders derive one kind of benefit from each ES in a one-to-one, production function manner; 3) Most ESs are amenable to market or non-market economic valuation; and 4) Stakeholders primarily conceive of the importance of nature in terms of ecosystems' production of benefits. We empirically evaluated these assumptions with a map-based interview protocol to characterize what can be managed (ES and related activities), what matters (benefits) and why (valueS). Based on interviews with residents of coastal communities in British Columbia, 87% of responses to cultural ES interview prompts conveyed bundles of linked services, benefits and values. Many ES-related values (e.g., transformative and identity) matter in ways that are not adequately expressed using market or non-market valuation. Respondents used diverse metaphors about why the ocean is important, not only the ES production metaphor, which assumes that values are a function of ecosystem processes. Our research demonstrates the utility of our interview protocol for providing a fuller representation of ecosystem-related values and benefits, potentially informing environmental decision-making processes.

AB This paper presents a method for mapping the nitrogen (N) status in a maize field using hyperspectral remote sensing imagery. An airborne survey was conducted with an AISA Eagle hyperspectral sensor over an experimental farm where maize (Zea mays L.) was grown with two N fertilization levels (0 and 100 kg N ha(-1)) in four replicates. Leaf and canopy field data were collected during the flight. The nitrogen (N) status has been estimated in this work based on the Nitrogen Nutrition Index (NNI), defined as the ratio between the leaf actual N concentration (%N-a) of the crop and the minimum N content required for the maximum biomass production (critical N concentration (%N-c)) calculated through the dry mass at the time of the flight (W-flight). The inputs required to calculate the NNI (i.e., % N-a and W-flight) have been estimated through regression analyses between field data and remotely sensed vegetation indices. MCARI/MTVI2 (Modified Chlorophyll Absorption Ratio Index/Modified Triangular Vegetation Index 2) showed the best performances in estimating the % Na (R-2 = 0.59) and MTVI2 in estimating the W-flight (R-2 = 0.80). The % Na and the W-flight were then mapped and used to compute the NNI map over the entire field. The NNI map agreed with the NNI estimated using field data through traditional destructive measurements (R-2 = 0.70) confirming the potential of using remotely sensed indices to assess the crop N condition. Finally, a method to derive a pixel based variable rate N fertilization map was proposed as the difference between the actual N content and the optimal N content. We think that the proposed operational methodology is promising for precision farming since it represents an innovative attempt to derive a variable rate N fertilization map based on the actual crop N status from an aerial hyperspectral image.

AB Civic ecology practices are community based, environmental stewardship actions taken to enhance green infrastructure, ecosystem services, and human well-being in cities and other human-dominated landscapes. Examples include tree planting in post-Katrina New Orleans, oyster restoration in New York City, community gardening in Detroit, friends of parks groups in Seattle, and natural area restoration in Cape Flats, South Africa. Whereas civic ecology practices are growing in number and represent a participatory approach to management and knowledge production as called for by global sustainability initiatives, only rarely are their contributions to ecosystem services measured. In this paper, we draw On literature sources and our prior research in urban social-ecological systems to explore protocols for monitoring biodiversity, functional measures of ecosystem services, and ecosystem services valuation that can be adapted for use by practitioner-scientist partnerships in civic ecology settings. Engaging civic ecology stewards in collecting such measurements presents opportunities to gather data that can be used as feedback in an adaptive co-management process. Further, we suggest that civic ecology practices not only create green infrastructure that produces ecosystem services, but also constitute social-ecological processes that directly generate ecosystem services (e.g., recreation, education) and associated benefits to human well-being.

AB Increased habitat diversity is often predicted to promote the diversity of animal communities because a greater variety of habitats increases the opportunities for species to specialize on different resources and coexist. Although positive correlations between the diversities of habitat and associated animals are often observed, the underlying mechanisms are only now starting to emerge, and none have been tested specifically in the marine environment. Scleractinian corals constitute the primary habitat-forming organisms on coral reefs and, as such, play an important role in structuring associated reef fish communities. Using the same field experimental design in two geographic localities differing in regional fish species composition, we tested the effects of coral species richness and composition on the diversity, abundance, and structure of the local fish community. Richness of coral species overall had a positive effect on fish species richness but had no effect on total fish abundance or evenness. At both localities, certain individual coral species supported similar levels of fish diversity and abundance as the high coral richness treatments, suggesting that particular coral species are disproportionately important in promoting high local fish diversity. Furthermore, in both localities, different microhabitats (coral species) supported very different fish communities, indicating that most reef fish species distinguish habitat at the level of coral species. Fish communities colonizing treatments of higher coral species richness represented a combination of those inhabiting the constituent coral species. These findings suggest that mechanisms underlying habitat-animal interaction in the terrestrial environment also apply to marine systems and highlight the importance of coral diversity to local fish diversity. The loss of particular key coral species is likely to have a disproportionate impact on the biodiversity of associated fish communities.

AB Habitat thresholds are usually defined as "points of abrupt change" in the species-habitat relationships. Habitat thresholds can be a key tool for understanding species requirements, and provide an objective definition of conservation targets, by identifying when habitat loss leads to a rapid loss of species, and the minimum amount of habitat necessary for species persistence. However, a large variety of statistical methods have been used to analyse them. In this context, we reviewed these methods and, using simulated data sets, we tested the main models to compare their performance on the identification of thresholds. We show that researchers use very different analytical tools, corresponding to different operational definitions of habitat thresholds, which can considerably affect their detection. Piecewise regression and generalized additive models allow both the distinction between linear and nonlinear dynamics, and the correct identification of break point position. In contrast, other methods such as logistic regression fail because they may incorrectly detect thresholds in gradual patterns, or they may over or underestimate the threshold position. In conservation or habitat modelling, it is important to focus efforts efficiently and the inappropriate choice of statistical methods may have detrimental consequences.

AB The Balkan Peninsula is one of three major European refugial areas. It has high biodiversity and endemism, but data on the age and origin of its fauna, especially endemics, are limited. Mitochondrial sequence data (COI and 16S genes) were used to study the population structure and phylogeography of the caddisfly Drusus croaticus and the phylogeny and divergence of seven other Drusus species, mostly range-restricted endemics of the Dinaric region of the Balkan Peninsula. The divergence of D. croaticus populations in Croatia and allopatric Drusus species in Bosnia dated to the Pleistocene, showing the importance of this time period for the origin and diversification of Balkan endemic taxa. The divergence of more distantly related species dated to the Late Miocene/Early Pliocene. Population genetic and phylogeographic analysis of 115 individuals from 11 populations of D. croaticus revealed a high level of genetic differentiation and absence of gene flow between populations separated by more than 10 km. The existence of allopatrically fragmented lineages in D. croaticus and the endemic Bosnian species is most likely the result of long-term isolation in multiple microrefugia, probably due to the specific habitat requirements and life-history traits of Drusinae coupled with the topographic complexity and historical changes in geomorphology of the region. Overall, these findings shed light on the processes generating the high genetic complexity of this refugial region that parallels the 'refugia within refugia' pattern widely reported from the Iberian refugium.

AB Some 1339 trees from 48 Pinus pinaster stands were characterized by five chloroplast microsatellites, detecting a total of 103 distinct haplotypes. Frequencies for the 16 most abundant haplotypes (p(k) > 0.01) were spatially interpolated over a lattice made by 430 grid points. Fitting of spatially interpolated values on raw haplotype frequencies at the same geographical location was tested by regression analysis. A range-wide 'diversity map' based on interpolated haplotype frequencies allowed the identification of one 'hotspot' of diversity in central and southeastern Spain, and two areas of low haplotypic diversity located in the western Iberian peninsula and Morocco. Principal component analysis (PCA) carried out on haplotypes frequency surfaces allowed the construction of a colour-based 'synthetic' map of the first three PC components, enabling the detection of the main range-scale genetic trends and the identification of three main 'gene pools' for the species: (i) a 'southeastern' gene pool, including southeastern France, Italy, Corsica, Sardinia, Pantelleria and northern Africa; (ii) an 'Atlantic' gene pool, including all the western areas of the Iberian peninsula; and (iii) a 'central' gene pool, located in southeastern Spain. Multivariate and amova analyses carried out on interpolated grid point frequency values revealed the existence of eight major clusters ('gene zones'), whose genetic relationships were related with the history of the species. In addition, demographic models showed more ancient expansions in the eastern and southern ranges of maritime pine probably associated to early postglacial recolonization. The delineation of the gene zones provides a baseline for designing conservation areas in this key Mediterranean pine.

AB The relationships among families of catfishes are poorly understood and have yet to be the subject of a comprehensive investigation with molecular data. Existing phylogenetic hypotheses are based on morphological data and incompletely resolved. This study analyzed complete sequences of mitochondrial gene cytochrome b for 170 species from 29 of 33 extant families, and focused on the relationships of Ictakiridae to other catfishes. In addition to previous phylogenetic studies, the fossil record, paleogeography, biogeography, and distribution of extant catfish families collectively suggest the location (if extant) of the ictalurid sister taxon to be Northern or Eastern Asia. Of the extant catfishes currently native to this area and included in this analysis, parsimony and Bayesian likelihood analyses recovered Cranoglanis bouderius as the most proximal sister taxon of Icuiluride. Seemingly, ictalurids and cranoglaniclids represent another biogeographic component linking freshwater fishes of North America and eastern Asia, e.g., catostomids and paddlefishes. The results coupled with present-day catfish distributions and inferences from the fossil record collectively suggest the ancestor of Ictaluridae to have invaded freshwaters of North America at the close of the Cretaceous through northeastern Asia and northwestern North America. Other superfamilial nodes supported the results of previous phylogenetic studies of narrower taxonomic scope. Several novel relationships were recovered (including a clade composed of Pimelodidae, Pseudopimelodidae, and Heptapteridae) and these along with sources of systematic error are discussed. A broad sampling of Bagriclae permitted an examination of intergeneric relationships within this family and in light of recent morphological and molecular studies. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

AB Temperate forests are predicted to play a key role as important sinks for atmospheric carbon dioxide, which could be enhanced by nitrogen (N) deposition, However, experimental evidence suggests flat the impact of N deposition on temperate forest productivity may not be as great as originally assumed. We investigated how chronic N addition affects needle morphology, nitrogen metabolism (or partitioning) photosynthetic capacity and foliage productivity. The investigation is based at the Harvard Forest (MA) as part of a now 15-year long N amendment study. Foliar N content in red pine (Pinus resinosa) of the high N treatment has significantly increased, but this increase was accompanied by a de-coupling of the photosynthesis-N relationship. In addition needle longevity in the high N trees was significantly lower compared to the control trees. Conifers of the hi-h N treatment did not use the surplus of N to optimize the amount of photosynthetically active metabolites. Instead N accumulated as soluble protein (other than Rubisco), amino acids and chlorophyll. Photosynthetic capacity in the control trees was about 50% higher than in the fertilized trees. These results indicate that the increase in leaf N is not accompanied by a greater capacity for carbon assimilation in the high N treatment. Using a simple model (PnET-Day) of canopy photosynthesis and carbon allocation, we assessed the long-term effect of these physiological changes on ecosystem carbon balance. The model results emphasize and reinforce the large difference between rates of carbon accumulation predicted to occur if net photosynthesis remained linearly related to foliar N concentration, and rates measured in the field.

AB Bearded vulture populations in the Western Palearctic have experienced a severe decline during the last two centuries that has led to the near extinction of the species in Europe. In this study we analyse the sequence variation at the mitochondrial control region throughout the species range to infer its recent evolutionary history and to evaluate the current genetic status of the species. This study became possible through the extensive use of museum specimens to study populations now extinct. Phylogenetic analysis revealed the existence of two divergent mitochondrial lineages, lineage A occurring mainly in Western European populations and lineage B in African, Eastern European and Central Asian populations. The relative frequencies of haplotypes belonging to each lineage in the different populations show a steep East-West clinal distribution with maximal mixture of the two lineages in the Alps and Greece populations. A genealogical signature for population growth was found for lineage B, but not for lineage A; futhermore the Clade B haplotypes in western populations and clade A haplo-types in eastern populations are recently derived, as revealed by their peripheral location in median-joining haplotype networks. This phylogeographical pattern suggests allopatric differentiation of the two lineages in separate Mediterranean and African or Asian glacial refugia, followed by range expansion from the latter leading to two secondary contact suture zones in Central Europe and North Africa. High levels of among-population differentiation were observed, although these were not correlated with geographical distance. Due to the marked genetic structure, extinction of Central European populations in the last century re-sulted in the loss of a major portion of the genetic diversity of the species. We also found direct evidence for the effect of drift altering the genetic composition of the remnant Pyrenean population after the demographic bottleneck of the last century. Our results argue for the management of the species as a single population, given the apparent ecological exchangeability of extant stocks, and support the ongoing reintroduction of mixed ancestry birds in the Alps and planned reintroductions in Southern Spain.

AB Whether resources (bottom-up forces), natural enemies (top-down forces), or both, determine the abundance of insect herbivore populations in plant-insect herbivore-natural enemy systems remains a major issue in population ecology. Unlike recent surveys of the tritrophic literature we do not seek to quantify whether top-down or bottom-up forces predominate in any given set of experimental systems. Acknowledging the dearth of empirical synthesis we employ two contrasting literature surveys to determine whether the plant-insect herbivore-natural enemy literature is currently adequate to form a conceptual synthesis of the relative roles of top-down and bottom-up forces.
   The emergence of a synthesis of the relative roles of top-down and bottom-up forces in plant-insect herbivore-natural enemy systems appears to have been largely prevented by (1) the absence of appropriate empirical data; (2) failure to appreciate the merits of existing data; (3) a continued desire to emphasise either top-down ol bottom-up forces to the exclusion of the other; and (4) confusion regarding which processes regulate and which influence the abundance of insect herbivores.

AB Despite the resolving power of DNA markers, pelagic and migratory marine fish species generally show very little geographical population structuring. In mackerel (Scomber scombrus L.) population differentiation has been detected only at a transatlantic scale. By applying two regions in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) (D-loop and cytochrome b (cytb)) in combination with genealogical and frequency-based statistical approaches, our data suggest population differentiation among eastern Atlantic spawning stocks. In contrast, and indicative of homing behaviour, no genetic structuring was observed among shoals of individuals outside the spawning season. Among spawning stocks, mtDNA D-loop sequences detected differentiation within the eastern Atlantic, while the cytb gene detected transatlantic differentiation. The impact of recurrent events (e.g. gene flow restricted by isolation by distance) and historic events (e.g. population range expansions) among spawning stocks was investigated applying a nested cladistic analysis of geographical distribution of cytb haplotype lineages. In the eastern Atlantic, historical population range expansion, presumably in connection with recolonization of northern areas after the last glaciation, is suggested to be the main factor determining mtDNA lineage distribution. This was supported by estimates of mtDNA nucleotide diversity, where the highest diversity was observed for the stock spawning in the Bay of Biscay, for which the size estimate is only 15% of the largest stock (Celtic Sea). In addition to revealing population differentiation,, our data demonstrate the importance of sampling strategy and the power of applying statistical methods addressing both ongoing and historical population processes.

AB We explore the extent to which a simple mechanistic model of short-term plant carbon (C) dynamics can account for a number of generally observed plant phenomena. For an individual, fully expanded leaf, the model predicts that the fast-turnover labile C, starch and protein pools are driven into an approximate or moving steady state that is proportional to the average leaf absorbed irradiance on a time-scale of days to weeks, even under realistic variable light conditions, in qualitative agreement with general patterns of leaf acclimation to light observed both temporally within the growing season and spatially within plant canopies, When the fast-turnover pools throughout the whole plant (including stems and roots) also follow this moving steady state, the model predicts that the time-averaged whole-plant net primary productivity is proportional to the time-averaged canopy absorbed irradiance and to gross canopy photosynthesis, and thus suggests a mechanistic explanation of the observed approximate constancy of plant light-use efficiency (LUE) and carbon-use efficiency. Under variable light conditions, the fast-turnover pool sizes and the LUE are predicted to depend negatively on the coefficient of variation of irradiance, We also show that the LUE has a maximum,vith respect to the fraction of leaf labile C allocated to leaf protein synthesis (a(lp)), reflecting a trade-off between leaf photosynthesis and leaf respiration. The optimal value of a(lp) is predicted to decrease at elevated [CO2](a), suggesting an adaptive interpretation of leaf acclimation to CO2. The model therefore brings together a number of empirical observations within a common mechanistic framework.

AB Minirhizotrons have proved useful to understand the dynamics and function of fine roots. However, they have been used comparatively infrequently in forests and other natural plant communities. Several factors have contributed to this situation, including anomalous root distributions along the minirhizotron surface and the difficulty of extracting data from minirhizotron images. Technical and methodological advances have ameliorated some of these difficulties, and minirhizotrons have considerable potential to address some questions of long standing interest. These questions include more fully understanding the role of roots in carbon and nutrient cycling, rates of root decomposition, responses to resource availability and the functional significance of interactions between plant roots and soil organisms. Maximizing the potential for minirhizotrons to help us better understand the functional importance of fine roots in natural plant communities depends upon using them to answer only those questions appropriate to both their inherent strengths and limitations.

AB Context The karst region of southwestern China, one of the largest continuous karsts in the world, is known for its unique landscapes and rich biodiversity. This region has suffered severe environmental degradation (e.g., vegetation cover loss, soil erosion and biodiversity loss). In recent decades, Chinese governments at different levels have initiated several ecological programs (e.g., Green for Grain, Mountain Closure) to restore the degraded environment and to alleviate poverty. Objectives This study summarizes landscape studies of karst landscapes patterns, their dynamics and interactions among landscape pattern, hydrological processes and ecosystem services (ES). Methods We conducted a systematic literature review of science and land use policy to identify knowledge gaps and recommend future research and policy directions. Results Karst landscapes have experienced rapid turnover in recent decades due largely to the overlap of intense human activity on the fragile karst ecosystems. Many studies have comprehensively examined hydrology, soil processes and ecosystem services (ES) and their relationships with landscape pattern. Most of these studies have found that karst ecosystems recover with improved ES. However, the importance of epikarst in hydrological and soil processes, intense anthropogenic disturbance and landscape heterogeneity in landscape models remains elusive. Conclusions Future research should focus on in-depth examination and modelling of karst specific hydrological and soil processes, investigating relationships between climatic change, landscape change, ecological processes, and region-specific ES assessments. Results from such research should provide the necessary scientific support for a comprehensive, national karst rocky desertification treatment project (Stage II) and poverty alleviation initiatives.

AB Loss of biodiversity caused by intensive agriculture is a major worldwide concern. Crop rotation can enhance crop productivity and increase soil microbial diversity. However, the functional significances of changes in soil microbial communities are poorly understood.
   Soil microbial communities from a cucumber monoculture system and the cucumber season of a two-year rotation system (tomato-celery-cucumber-Chinese cabbage) were analyzed by quantitative PCR and high throughput amplicon sequencing. Then, feedback effects of soil biota on cucumber seedlings were evaluated through soil sterilization, addition of soil inoculum, and application of bactericide and fungicide.
   Crop rotation increased cucumber yield and bacterial diversity, but decreased fungal diversity and abundance. The bacterial and fungal community compositions also differed between the two cropping systems. Abundances of potential plant pathogens and antagonistic microorganisms were lower while potential plant-growth-promoting microorganisms were higher in the rotation system. The overall effect of soil biota was positive on cucumber seedling growth, and was stronger in the rotation system.
   Increasing temporal plant diversity can change soil microbial communities and enhance crop productivity through positive plant-soil feedbacks mediated by soil biota.

AB The restoration of degraded vegetation can effectively improve ecosystem services, increase human well-being, and promote regional sustainable development. Understanding the changing trends in ecosystem services and their drivers is an important step in informing derision makers for the development of reasonable landscape management measures. From 2001 to 2014, we analyzed the changing trends in five critical ecosystem services in the Xilingol Grassland, which is typical of grasslands in North China, including net primary productivity (NPP), soil conservation (SC), soil loss due to wind (SL), water yield (WY) and water retention (WR). Additionally, we quantified how climatic factors and landscape patterns affect the five ecosystem services on both annual and seasonal time scales. Overall, the results indicated that vegetation restoration can effectively improve the five grassland ecosystem services, and precipitation (PPT) is the most critical climatic factor. The impact of changes in the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was most readily detectable on the annual time scale, whereas the impact of changes in landscape pattern was most readily detectable on the seasonal time scale. A win-win situation in terms of grassland ecosystem services (e.g., vegetation productivity, SC, WR and reduced SL) can be achieved by increasing grassland aggregation, partitioning the largest grasslands, dividing larger areas of farmland into smaller patches, and increasing the area of appropriate forest stands.

AB The notion that relationships between community-weighted mean (CWM) traits (i.e. plot-level trait values weighted by species abundances) and environmental conditions reflect selection towards locally optimal phenotypes is challenged by the large amount of interspecific trait variation typically found within ecological communities. Reconciling these contrasting patterns is a key to advancing predictive theories of functional community ecology. We combined data on geographical distributions and three traits (wood density, leaf mass per area and maximum height) of 173 tree species in Puerto Rico. We tested the hypothesis that species are more likely to occur where their trait values are more similar to the local CWM trait values (the 'CWM-optimality' hypothesis) by comparing species occurrence patterns (as a proxy for fitness) with the functional composition of forest plots across a precipitation gradient. While 70% of the species supported CWM-optimality for at least one trait, nearly 25% significantly opposed it for at least one trait, thereby contributing to local functional diversity. The majority (85%) of species that opposed CWM-optimality did so only for one trait and few species opposed CWM-optimality in multivariate trait space. Our study suggests that constraints to local functional variation act more strongly on multivariate phenotypes than on univariate traits.

AB Apomixis in angiosperms is asexual reproduction from seed. Its importance to angiospermous evolution and biodiversity has been difficult to assess mainly because of insufficient taxonomic documentation. Thus, we assembled literature reporting apomixis occurrences among angiosperms and transferred the information to an internet database (http://www.apomixis.uni-goettingen.de). We then searched for correlations between apomixis occurrences and well-established measures of taxonomic diversity and biogeography. Apomixis was found to be taxonomically widespread with no clear tendency to specific groups and to occur with sexuality at all taxonomic levels. Adventitious embryony was the most frequent form (148 genera) followed by apospory (110) and diplospory (68). All three forms are phylogenetically scattered, but this scattering is strongly associated with measures of biodiversity. Across apomictic-containing orders and families, numbers of apomict-containing genera were positively correlated with total numbers of genera. In general, apomict-containing orders, families, and subfamilies of Asteraceae, Poaceae, and Orchidaceae were larger, i.e., they possessed more families or genera, than non-apomict-containing orders, families or subfamilies. Furthermore, many apomict-containing genera were found to be highly cosmopolitan. In this respect, 62% occupy multiple geographic zones. Numbers of genera containing sporophytic or gametophytic apomicts decreased from the tropics to the arctic, a trend that parallels general biodiversity. While angiosperms appear to be predisposed to shift from sex to apomixis, there is also evidence of reversions to sexuality. Such reversions may result from genetic or epigenetic destabilization events accompanying hybridization, polyploidy, or other cytogenetic alterations. Because of increased within-plant genetic and genomic heterogeneity, range expansions and diversifications at the species and genus levels may occur more rapidly upon reversion to sexuality. The significantly-enriched representations of apomicts among highly diverse and geographically-extensive taxa, from genera to orders, support this conclusion.

AB Wildfire is a major driver of spatio-temporal variation in terrestrial ecosystems. Large wildfires are predicted to occur more frequently due to climate change. The mechanisms by which post-fire recovery proceeds are influenced by the abundance of survivors, and their distribution in relation to habitat variability and refugia. Thus, characterising early post-fire demographic processes is critical to understanding the demographic and community-level responses of ecosystems to fire. The Black Saturday fires of February 2009 burnt an area of approximately 3500 km2 in Victoria, Australia. We quantified the effects of this high severity forest fire on the habitat, abundance, sex ratio and body mass of two small mammal species, the agile antechinus Antechinus agilis and bush rat Rattus fuscipes. We developed a hypothetical framework to distinguish in situ survival and rapid recolonisation as the processes underlying short-term post-fire distributions. These hypotheses were based on expected patterns of abundance over increasing distances from unburnt sources, and the estimated recolonisation capabilities of each species and sex. The agile antechinus and bush rat were present in burnt sites at 30% and 12% of the density observed in unburnt sites. In situ survival, and not recolonisation, was the most plausible explanation for our findings. Abundance and body mass data indicated a greater effect of fire on the bush rat than the agile antechinus. The bush rat showed a shift in topographic association, whereby drainage lines acted as post-fire refugia. Our findings suggest these species do not depend on recolonisation for recovery, and that the bush rat will follow a nucleated recovery, expanding from topographic refugia. Thus, connectivity-reducing management activities, such as salvage logging and firebreak and road construction, may not affect the early stages of population recovery in remaining stands of burnt forest. Rather, ongoing recovery is likely to be limited by demographic rates and resource availability.

AB Understanding the factors related to invasive exotic species distributions at broad spatial scales has important theoretical and management implications, because biological invasions are detrimental to many ecosystem functions and processes. Housing development facilitates invasions by disturbing land cover, introducing nonnative landscaping plants, and facilitating dispersal of propagules along roads. To evaluate relationships between housing and the distribution of invasive exotic plants, we asked (1) how strongly is housing associated with the spatial distribution of invasive exotic plants compared to other anthropogenic and environmental factors; (2) what type of housing pattern is related to the richness of invasive exotic plants; and (3) do invasive plants represent ecological traits associated with specific housing patterns? Using two types of regression analysis (best subset analysis and hierarchical partitioning analysis), we found that invasive exotic plant richness was equally or more strongly related to housing variables than to other human (e. g., mean income and roads) and environmental (e. g., topography and forest cover) variables at the county level across New England. Richness of invasive exotic plants was positively related to area of wildland-urban interface (WUI), low-density residential areas, change in number of housing units between 1940 and 2000, mean income, plant productivity (NDVI), and altitudinal range and rainfall; it was negatively related to forest area and connectivity. Plant life history traits were not strongly related to housing patterns. We expect the number of invasive exotic plants to increase as a result of future housing growth and suggest that housing development be considered a primary factor in plans to manage and monitor invasive exotic plant species.

AB Background: South America's western coastline, extending in a near-straight line across some 35 latitudinal degrees, presents an elegant setting for assessing both contemporary and historic influences on cladogenesis in the marine environment. Southern bull-kelp (Durvillaea antarctica) has a broad distribution along much of the Chilean coast. This species represents an ideal model taxon for studies of coastal marine connectivity and of palaeoclimatic effects, as it grows only on exposed rocky coasts and is absent from beaches and ice-affected shores. We expected that, along the central Chilean coast, D. antarctica would show considerable phylogeographic structure as a consequence of the isolating effects of distance and habitat discontinuities. In contrast, we hypothesised that further south - throughout the region affected by the Patagonian Ice Sheet at the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) - D. antarctica would show relatively little genetic structure, reflecting postglacial recolonisation.
   Results: Mitochondrial (COI) and chloroplast (rbcL) DNA analyses of D. antarctica from 24 Chilean localities (164 individuals) revealed two deeply divergent (4.5 - 6.1% for COI, 1.4% for rbcL) clades from the centre and south of the country, with contrasting levels and patterns of genetic structure. Among populations from central Chile (32 degrees - 44 degrees S), substantial phylogeographic structure was evident across small spatial scales, and a significant isolation-by-distance effect was observed. Genetic disjunctions in this region appear to correspond to the presence of long beaches. In contrast to the genetic structure found among central Chilean populations, samples from the southern Chilean Patagonian region (49 degrees - 56 degrees S) were genetically homogeneous and identical to a haplotype recently found throughout the subantarctic region.
   Conclusions: Southern (Patagonian) Chile has been recolonised by D. antarctica relatively recently, probably since the LGM. The inferred trans-oceanic ancestry of these Patagonian populations supports the notion that D. antarctica is capable of long-distance dispersal via rafting. In contrast, further north in central Chile, the correspondence of genetic disjunctions in D. antarctica with long beaches indicates that habitat discontinuity drives genetic isolation among established kelp populations. We conclude that rafting facilitates colonisation of unoccupied shores, but has limited potential to enhance gene-flow among established populations. Broadly, this study demonstrates that some taxa may be considered to have either high or low dispersal potential across different temporal and geographic scales.

AB An important component of plant-soil feedbacks is how plant species identity and diversity influence soil organism communities. We examine the effects of grassland plant species growing alone and together up to a richness of 12 species on nematode diversity and feeding group composition, eight years after the establishment of experimental grassland plots at the BIODEPTH site in northern Sweden. This is a substantially longer time than most other experimental studies of plant effects on soil fauna. We address the hypotheses that (1a) higher species or functional diversity of plants increases nematode diversity, as well as influences nematode community composition. Alternatively, (1b) individual plant species traits are most important for nematode diversity and community composition. (2) Plant effects on soil organisms will decrease with increasing number of trophic links between plants and soil fauna.
   Plant species identity was often more important than plant diversity for nematode community composition, supporting hypothesis 1b. There was a weak positive relation between plant and nematode richness, which could be attributed to the presence of the legume Trifolium pratense, but also to some other plant species, suggesting a selection or sampling effect. Several plant species in different functional groups affected nematode community composition. For example, we found that legumes increased bacterial-feeding nematodes, most notably r-selected Rhabditida, while fungal-feeding nematodes were enhanced by forbs. Other bacterial feeders and obligate root feeders were positively related to grasses. Plant effects were usually stronger on plant-, bacterial- and fungal-feeding nematodes than on omnivores/predators, which supports hypothesis 2.
   Our study suggests that plant identity has stronger effects than plant diversity on nematode community composition, but when comparing our results with similar previous studies the effects of particular plant species appear to vary. We also found that more productive plant species affected bacterial- feeding nematodes more than fungal feeders. Moreover, we observed stronger effects the fewer the number of trophic links there were between a nematode feeding group and plants. Although we found clear effects of plants on soil nematodes, these were probably not large enough to result in strong and persistent plant- soil-organism-plant feedback loops.

AB Biotic interactions in the rhizosphere are biologically important, and although many of those interactions have been well studied, the role of secreted proteins in the cross-talk between microbes and roots has not been investigated. Here, protein secretion was studied during the communication between the roots of two plants (Medicago sativa and Arabidopsis thaliana) and the bacterial symbiont of one of these species (Sinorhizobium meliloti strain Rm1021) and an opportunistic bacterial pathogen of A. thaliana (Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000) using a proteomic approach. It was found that protein exudation in the M. sativa-S. meliloti interaction caused an increase in the secretion of seven plant proteins, such as hydrolases, peptidases, and peroxidases among others in two or more time points compared with the plant control. In addition, four proteins, all of bacterial origin, were increased 1.5-fold more in this interaction compared with S. meliloti alone. However, these proteins were not induced when M. sativa was inoculated with P. syringae DC3000. The interaction between A. thaliana and P. syringae DC3000 highly induced the secretion of several plant proteins related to defense soon after initial contact with P. syringae, but these proteins were not secreted in the incompatible interaction with S. meliloti. The results of this study reveal a specific, protein level cross-talk between roots and microbes. These results suggest that secreted proteins may be a critical component in the process of signaling and recognition that occurs between compatible and incompatible interactions.

AB Spatio-temporal variability in river flow is a fundamental control on instream habitat structure and riverine ecosystem biodiversity and integrity. However, long-term riverine ecological time-series to test hypotheses about hydrology-ecology interactions in a broader temporal context are rare, and studies spanning multiple rivers are often limited in their temporal coverage to less than five years. To address this research gap. a unique spatio-temporal hydroecological analysis was conducted of long-term instream ecological responses (1990-2000) to river flow regime variability at 83 sites across England and Wales. The results demonstrate clear hydroecological associations at the national scale (all data). In addition. significant differences ill ecological response are recorded between three 'regions' identified (RM 1-3*) associated with characteristics of the flow regime. The effect of two major supra-seasonal droughts (1990-1992 and 1996-1997) on inter-annual (IA) variability of the LIFE scores is evident with both events showing a gradual decline before and recovery of LIFE scores after the low flow period. The instream community response to high magnitude flow regimes (1994 and 1995) is also apparent, although these associations are less striking. The results demonstrate classification of rivers into flow regime regions offers a way to help unravel complex hydroecological associations. The approach adopted herein could easily be adapted for other geographical locations, where datasets are available. Such work is imperative to understand flow regime-ecology interactions in a longer term, wider spatial context and so assess future hydroecological responses to climate change and anthropogenic modification of riverine ecosystems.

AB Projection of species-response to climate change scenarios is a key tool in conservation strategy. Previous studies have projected climate change impacts for animal and vascular plant species using the 'bioclimatic envelope' approach. In this study we apply the principles of the bioclimatic envelope approach to examine the response of 26 lichen species whose distributions are well characterised within the British Isles. Lichen species were subjectively selected based on their contrasting distributions, and their ecological traits, which fulfilled as closely as possible the assumptions of the bioclimatic envelope method. We used a split-sampling approach to model the species-response to present-day climate using confirmed records and pseudo-absences as input data, and testing each model against an 'independent' calibration dataset. Predictive models were projected using standard climate change scenarios comprising the UKCIP02 data. Projections indicate broad trends in the response of species placed into contrasting biogeographic groups, and point to the potential for significant change in the spatial distribution of the British lichen flora. We highlight putative threats to montane and Boreal elements of the lichen flora, and emphasise significant uncertainty in projected response of the UK's internationally important oceanic flora.

AB The degree to which spatial patterns influence the dynamics and distribution of populations is a central question in ecology. This question is even more pressing in the context of rapid habitat loss and fragmentation, which threaten global biodiversity. However, the relative influence of habitat loss and landscape fragmentation, the spatial patterning of remaining habitat, remains unclear.. If landscape pattern affects population size, managers may be able to design landscapes that mitigate habitat loss. We present the results of a mensurative experiment designed to test four habitat loss vs. fragmentation hypotheses. Unlike previous studies, we measured landscape structure using quantitative, spatially explicit habitat distribution models previously developed for two species: Blackburnian Warbler (Dendroica fusca) and Ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapilla). We used a stratified sampling design that reduced the confounding of habitat amount and fragmentation variables. Occurrence and reoccurrence of both species were strongly influenced by,characteristics at scales greater than the individual territory, indicating little support for the random-sample hypothesis. However, the type and spatial extent of landscape influence differed. Both occurrence and reoccurrence of Blackburnian Warblers were influenced by the amount of poor-quality matrix at 300- and 2000-m spatial extents. The occurrence and reoccurrence of Ovenbirds depended on a landscape pattern variable, patch size, but only in cases when patches were isolated. These results support the hypothesis that landscape pattern is important for some species only when the amount of suitable habitat is low. Although theoretical models have predicted such an interaction between landscape fragmentation and composition, to our knowledge this is the first study to report empirical evidence of such nonlinear fragmentation effects. Defining landscapes quantitatively from an organism-based perspective may increase power to detect fragmentation effects, particularly in forest mosaics where boundaries between patches and matrix are ambiguous. Our results indicate that manipulating landscape pattern may reduce negative impacts of habitat loss for Ovenbird, but not Blackburnian Warbler. We emphasize that most variance in the occurrence of both species was explained by local scale or landscape composition variables rather than variables reflecting landscape pattern.

AB According to projections by the United Nations, 60% of the world's population will reside in urban areas by 2030. Studies of the ecology of cities and ecology in cities will therefore assume increasing relevance as urban communities seek to protect and/or enhance their ecological resources. Presently, the most serious threats to wildlife include the degradation and/or loss of habitats, the introduction and spread of problem species, water pollution, unsympathetic management, and the encroachment of inappropriate development. Climate change could add to these problems through competition from exotic species, the spread of disease and pests, increased summer drought stress for wetlands and woodland, and sea-level rise threatening rare coastal habitats. Earlier springs, longer frost-free seasons, and reduced snowfall could further affect the dates of egg-laying, as well as the emergence, first flowering and health of leafing or flowering plants. Small birds and naturalized species could thrive in the warmer winters associated with the combined effect of regional climate change and enhanced urban heat island. This article reviews the range of climate-related threats to biodiversity in the aquatic, intertidal and terrestrial habitats of urban areas. London is used as a case study to illustrate potential impacts, and to contend that 'green spaces' in cities could be used by planners to counter climate-related threats to biodiversity, as well as to improve flood control and air quality, and reduce urban heat island effects.

AB We tested the prediction that global warming has caused recent decreases in body weight (Bergmann's rule) and increases in wing length (Allen's rule) in 14 species of passerine birds at two localities in England: Wicken Fen (1968-2003) and Treswell Wood (1973-2003).
   Predicted long-term linear decreases in residual body weight occurred in four species: dunnocks (Wicken Fen), and great tits, blue tits and bullfinches (Treswell Wood). Non-linear decreases also occurred in reed warblers and blackcaps at Wicken Fen, which also had a surprising linear increase in residual body weight in blackbirds.
   Residual wing lengths increased linearly, as predicted, in six of seven species at Wicken Fen. Whereas there were non-linear long-term increases in wrens, dunnocks and blackbirds in Treswell Wood. Unexpected linear decreases also occurred in residual wing lengths in willow warblers (Wicken Fen), and blue tits, great tits and chaffinches (Treswell Wood).
   The most parsimonious explanation for such long-term changes in body weight is global warming, as predicted by Bergmann's rule. Greater site and species-specific effects on wing length (e.g. non-linear changes plus shorter wings in the woodland habitat) suggest a less straightforward conclusion concerning Allen's rule, probably because wing length involved variation in both bone and feather growth.
   Changes in residual body weights and wing lengths often differed between species and were sometimes non-linear, perhaps reflecting short-term modifications in selection pressures. Human-induced influences are discussed, such as avian predator population densities and land-use change. Short-term variation in temperature had little effect, but rainfall did explain the unusual increase in blackbird body weight, possibly as a result of improving food (earthworm) availability.

AB Despite the fact that recruitment can significantly influence the population dynamics of benthic marine populations, relatively Little is known about the biological and physical processes controlling recruitment. We selected eight closely related coral reef fishes (wrasses in the family Labridae) to examine the temporal and spatial patterns of juvenile recruitment to the Caribbean island of Barbados. We used a comparative approach to study the relationships among patterns of recruitment, early Life history traits, and aspects of the physical environment. For 10 wk during each of three peak recruitment (spring) seasons (1990-1992), we used a biweekly census of recently settled juveniles (8-25 mm standard length, SL) to measure the abundance of six congeners, Halichoeres bivittatus, H. radiatus, H. poeyi, H. garnoti, H. pictus, and H. maculipinna, and two confamilial labrids, Thalassoma bifasciatum and Bodianus rufus. Analysis of the otoliths of a sample of collected specimens provided estimates of larval durations, postsettlement ages, sizes at settlement, and juvenile growth rates, enabling back-calculation of settlement day for all collected juveniles. We compared temporal patterns of recruitment among species, and spatial patterns of recruitment for the most common species.
   Temporal patterns of recruitment were consistent among seasons for most of the labrids examined, although the magnitude of recruitment was less predictable (particularly for H. poeyi, H. maculipinna, and B. rufus). The eight labrids could be divided into two groups based on their early Life history traits and within-season temporal patterns of recruitment. Halichoeres bivittatus, H. radiatus, H. poeyi, H. garnoti, and H. pictus had larval durations that were relatively short and invariant (means of 23-27 d), and all settled at fairly large sizes (9-12 mm SL) during the new moon and first maximum amplitude tide. In contrast, T. bifasciatum, B. rufus, and H. maculipinna had larval durations that were longer or more variable, and all three were able to delay metamorphosis. These three species settled at relatively smaller sizes (8-10 mm SL) during the third-quarter moon and second minimum amplitude tide. We compared temporal patterns of T. bifasciatum recruitment between Barbados and Caribbean Panama in an attempt to identify further the proximate environmental cues operating during settlement. Contrasting patterns of T. bifasciatum recruitment between the two geographical locations probably result from differences in the relative timing of the lunar and tidal amplitude cycles. Recruitment of labrids to Barbados occurred along the entire west coast of the island. Although some labrids had rather specific habitat requirements (e.g., B. rufus associated exclusively with large seaward-facing coral heads such as Montastrea spp.), most species were ubiquitous along the west coast. Species-specific juvenile densities did not often vary significantly among sites following major recruitment events, although overall densities were generally lower at a central site. Lower recruitment to that site likely results from reduced rates of larval supply due to prevailing offshore tidal flows.
   Thus, temporal and spatial patterns of labrid recruitment to Barbados appear to be more predictable than previously thought for reef fishes. In particular, variation in the tidal amplitude cycle may influence both the timing of settlement and, to a lesser degree, the spatial scale of larval supply. Finally, the interaction of larval biology with such physical processes is evident in the correlation between temporal patterns of recruitment and early life history traits. The functional nature of this relationship clearly warrants further study.

AB Additive genetic variance (VA) reflects the potential for evolutionary shifts and can be low for some traits or populations. High VA is critical for the conservation of threatened species under selection to facilitate adaptation. Theory predicts tight associations between population size and VA, but data from some experimental models, and managed and natural populations do not always support this prediction. However, VA comparisons often have low statistical power, are undertaken in highly controlled environments distinct from natural habitats, and focus on traits with limited ecological relevance. Moreover, investigations of VA typically fail to consider rare alleles, genetic load, or linkage disequilibrium, resulting in deleterious effects associated with favored alleles in small populations. Large population size remains essential for ensuring adaptation.

AB Climate change is having a significant impact on ecosystem services and is likely to become increasingly important as this phenomenon intensifies. Future impacts can be difficult to assess as they often involve long timescales, dynamic systems with high uncertainties, and are typically confounded by other drivers of change. Despite a growing literature on climate change impacts on ecosystem services, no quantitative syntheses exist. Hence, we lack an overarching understanding of the impacts of climate change, how they are being assessed, and the extent to which other drivers, uncertainties, and decision making are incorporated. To address this, we systematically reviewed the peer-reviewed literature that assesses climate change impacts on ecosystem services at subglobal scales. We found that the impact of climate change on most types of services was predominantly negative (59% negative, 24% mixed, 4% neutral, 13% positive), but varied across services, drivers, and assessment methods. Although uncertainty was usually incorporated, there were substantial gaps in the sources of uncertainty included, along with the methods used to incorporate them. We found that relatively few studies integrated decision making, and even fewer studies aimed to identify solutions that were robust to uncertainty. For management or policy to ensure the delivery of ecosystem services, integrated approaches that incorporate multiple drivers of change and account for multiple sources of uncertainty are needed. This is undoubtedly a challenging task, but ignoring these complexities can result in misleading assessments of the impacts of climate change, suboptimal management outcomes, and the inefficient allocation of resources for climate adaptation.

AB QuestionsIs there any evidence of coordination among leaf, stem and root traits, and thereby of the existence of a plant economics spectrum at the species and community level in Mediterranean forests? Are these traits related to plant size and seed mass?
   LocationMediterranean forests and shrublands, Sierra Morena mountains, Cordoba, southern Spain.
   MethodsWe selected nine woody plant communities along a natural local gradient of soil water and nutrient availability. We measured key leaf, stem, root and whole-plant traits for 38 dominant woody plant species. The variation across species of 15 functional traits (of the leaf, stem and root) was analysed and coordination among them was tested. We explored the relationships between these traits (hereafter resource-use traits' due to their close association with the acquisition-conservation trade-off) and plant height and seed mass. Finally, we compared results at species level with those calculated at community level, considering community-weighted means (CWMs).
   ResultsWe found a significant coordination between traits belonging to different plant organs, and propose the existence of a plant economics spectrum in Mediterranean forests along the environmental gradient. However, weaker relationships were found within groups of species under similar environmental conditions. We did not find the expected orthogonal relationships between plant height, seed mass and resource-use traits. Relationships among functional traits were stronger at the community level than at the species level.
   ConclusionsThis study reveals a high degree of functional coordination between traits belonging to different plant organs at both species and community level, and suggests the existence of a plant economics spectrum across 38 Mediterranean woody plant species. However, this general trend of functional coordination between organs became weaker or disappeared when considering restricted groups of species belonging to environmentally similar sites (e.g. dry vs wet sites), suggesting that the diversification of strategies within communities is not related to the economics spectrum at a lower spatial scale. Interestingly, the high degree of coordination between resource-use traits and seed mass at the community level seems to support the tolerance-fecundity model, which predicts an inverse relationship between fecundity and stress tolerance.

AB Postfire resprouting and recruitment from seed are key plant life-history traits that influence population dynamics, community composition and ecosystem function. Species can have one or both of these mechanisms. They confer resilience, which may determine community composition through differential species persistence after fire. To predict ecosystem level responses to changes in climate and fire conditions, we examined the proportions of these plant fire-adaptive traits among woody growth forms of 2880 taxa, in eight fire-prone ecosystems comprising similar to 87% of Australia's land area. Shrubs comprised 64% of the taxa. More tree (>84%) than shrub (similar to 50%) taxa resprouted. Basal, epicormic and apical resprouting occurred in 71%, 22% and 3% of the taxa, respectively. Most rainforest taxa (91%) were basal resprouters. Many trees (59%) in frequently-burnt eucalypt forest and savanna resprouted epicormically. Although crown fire killed many mallee (62%) and heathland (48%) taxa, fire-cued seeding was common in these systems. Postfire seeding was uncommon in rainforest and in arid Acacia communities that burnt infrequently at low intensity. Resprouting was positively associated with ecosystem productivity, but resprouting type (e.g. basal or epicormic) was associated with local scale fire activity, especially fire frequency. Although rainforest trees can resprout they cannot recruit after intense fires and may decline under future fires. Semi-arid Acacia communities would be susceptible to increasing fire frequencies because they contain few postfire seeders. Ecosystems dominated by obligate seeders (mallee, heath) are also susceptible because predicted shorter inter-fire intervals will prevent seed bank accumulation. Savanna may be resilient to future fires because of the adaptive advantage of epicormic resprouting among the eucalypts. The substantial non-resprouting shrub component of shrublands may decline, but resilient Eucalyptus spp. will continue to dominate under future fire regimes. These patterns of resprouting and postfire seeding provide new insights to ecosystem assembly, resilience and vulnerability to changing fire regimes on this fire-prone continent.

AB Understanding the drivers and implications of anthropogenic disturbance of ecological connectivity is a key concern for the conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem processes. Here, we review human activities that affect the movements and dispersal of aquatic organisms, including damming of rivers, river regulation, habitat loss and alteration, human-assisted dispersal of organisms and climate change. Using a series of case studies, we show that the insight needed to understand the nature and implications of connectivity, and to underpin conservation and management, is best achieved via data synthesis from multiple analytical approaches. We identify four key knowledge requirements for progressing our understanding of the effects of anthropogenic impacts on ecological connectivity: autecology; population structure; movement characteristics; and environmental tolerance/phenotypic plasticity. Structuring empirical research around these four broad data requirements, and using this information to parameterise appropriate models and develop management approaches, will allow for mitigation of the effects of anthropogenic disturbance on ecological connectivity in aquatic ecosystems.

AB Maximum entropy modeling (Maxent) is a widely used algorithm for predicting species distributions across space and time. Properly assessing the uncertainty in such predictions is non-trivial and requires validation with independent datasets. Notably, model complexity (number of model parameters) remains a major concern in relation to overfitting and, hence, transferability of Maxent models. An emerging approach is to validate the cross-temporal transferability of model predictions using paleoecological data. In this study, we assess the effect of model complexity on the performance of Maxent projections across time using two European plant species (Alnus giutinosa (L.) Gaertn. and Corylus avellana L) with an extensive late Quaternary fossil record in Spain as a study case. We fit 110 models with different levels of complexity under present time and tested model performance using AUC (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve) and AlCc (corrected Akaike Information Criterion) through the standard procedure of randomly partitioning current occurrence data. We then compared these results to an independent validation by projecting the models to mid-Holocene (6000 years before present) climatic conditions in Spain to assess their ability to predict fossil pollen presence-absence and abundance. We find that calibrating Maxent models with default settings result in the generation of overly complex models. While model performance increased with model complexity when predicting current distributions, it was higher with intermediate complexity when predicting mid-Holocene distributions. Hence, models of intermediate complexity resulted in the best trade-off to predict species distributions across time. Reliable temporal model transferability is especially relevant for forecasting species distributions under future climate change. Consequently, species-specific model tuning should be used to find the best modeling settings to control for complexity, notably with paleoecological data to independently validate model projections. For cross-temporal projections of species distributions for which paleoecological data is not available, models of intermediate complexity should be selected. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB Recent climate projections indicate substantial environmental alterations in oceanic island regions during the 21st century, setting up profound threats to insular floras. Inherent characteristics of island species and ecosystems (e.g. small population sizes, low habitat availability, isolated evolution, low functional redundancy) cause a particular vulnerability. Strong local anthropogenic pressures interact with climate change impacts and increase threats. Owing to the high degree of endemism in their floras, a disproportionally high potential for global biodiversity loss originates from climate change impacts on oceanic islands, We reviewed a growing body of research, finding evidence of emerging climate change influences as well as high potentials of future impacts on insular species and ecosystems. Threats from global climate change are not evenly distributed among the world's oceanic islands but rather vary with intrinsic (e.g. island area, structure, age and ecological complexity) and extrinsic factors (regional character, magnitude and rate of climatic alterations, local human influences). The greatest flora vulnerabilities to climate change impacts can be expected on islands of small area, low elevation and homogeneous topography. Islands of low functional redundancies will particularly suffer from high rates of co-modifications and co-extinctions due to climate-change-driven disruptions of ecological interactions. High threat potentials come from synergistic interactions between different factors, especially between climatic changes and local anthropogenic encroachments on native species and ecosystems. In addition, human responses to climate change can cause strong indirect impacts on island floras, making highly populated islands very vulnerable to secondary (derivative) effects. We provide an integrated overview of climate change-driven processes affecting oceanic island plants and depict knowledge gaps and uncertainties. The suitability of oceanic islands and their ecosystems for potential research on the field of climate change ecology is highlighted and implications for adequate research approaches are given.

AB The urbanization process affects faunal distributions and movement patterns, contributing directly to biotic homogenization and representing an important threat to biodiversity. In particular, birds, which have been well studied as indicators of anthropogenic disturbance, are especially valuable in evaluating these impacts.
   While the negative impact of these processes and structures, most notably road and railway networks, are now well appreciated (e.g. habitat loss, disturbance, noise, mortality by collisions, barrier effects), the potentially positive effects on wildlife are less appreciated (the number of documented negative effects of roads on animal abundance outnumbered the number of positive effects by a factor of 5). Here, were reviewed a total of 92 peer-reviewed publications for the period of 36 years between 1978 and 2014, which reported positive effects of roads and associated anthropogenic structures on birds. Our results show that roads, railways and several associated constructions, commonly implicated in the decline of biodiversity, may also have positive effects on certain bird species or communities. The main types of positive effects on birds identified were classified as: (1) roads: providing foraging habitat; reducing the predation pressures; and providing a warm surface assists in conserving metabolic energy; (2) lights of streets: prolonging diurnal activity; (3) powerlines, fences, etc. along roads: providing perches for hunting activities; and (4) bridges, pylons, tree lines along roadsides, bases of powerline pylons: providing nesting sites and cover from predators. From this review, we provide a useful tool for ecologists, road planners and other stakeholders engaged on conservation or landscape planning. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Guinea-Bissau is one of the poorest countries in the world with a large proportion of its population living in rural areas. While industry is limited, over 70% of the territory is covered by forests, which can potentially be used to attract investment through forest-based projects that promote reductions in carbon emissions and sustainable management. These can be leveraged by producing accurate maps of forest aboveground biomass (AGB) at national level and by developing cost-effective mapping methods that allow reliable future updating for management and engagement in international mechanisms such as the United Nations (UN) Collaborative Program on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD) in developing countries.
   Using data from Japan's Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) Phased Array L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR), this study compared a semi-empirical and machine learning algorithm, with the latter based on bagging stochastic gradient boosting (BagSGB), for retrieving the AGB of woody vegetation thereby supporting estimation of national carbon stocks. AGB was estimated by using measurements of tree size collected from112 forest plots during two field campaigns (2007 and 2008) as input to published allometric equations.
   The BagSGB outperformed the semi-empirical algorithm, resulting in a coefficient of correlation (R) between observed and cross-validation predicted forest AGB values of 0.95 and in a root mean square error (RMSE) of 26.62 Mg ha(-1). Furthermore, the BagSGB model produced also a measure of forest AGB prediction variability (coefficient of variation) on a pixel-by-pixel basis, with values ranging from 7 to 250% (mean = 42%). An estimate of total forest AGB carbon stock of 96.93 Mt C was obtained in this study for Guinea-Bissau, with a mean forest AGB value of 65.17 Mg ha(-1). Although the mean error associated with this forest AGB map is still undesirably high, several issues were addressed. The heterogeneity of forest structural types, presence of palm trees, and dimension and type of field plots were identified as potential source of uncertainty that must be tackled in future studies.

AB In this study, I examine the influence of urban canopy cover on gene flow between 15 white-footed mouse (Peromyscus leucopus) populations in New York City parklands. Parks in the urban core are often highly fragmented, leading to rapid genetic differentiation of relatively nonvagile species. However, a diverse array of green spaces may provide dispersal corridors through grey urban infrastructure. I identify urban landscape features that promote genetic connectivity in an urban environment and compare the success of two different landscape connectivity approaches at explaining gene flow. Gene flow was associated with effective distances between populations that were calculated based on per cent tree canopy cover using two different approaches: (i) isolation by effective distance (IED) that calculates the single best pathway to minimize passage through high-resistance (i.e. low canopy cover) areas, and (ii) isolation by resistance (IBR), an implementation of circuit theory that identifies all low-resistance paths through the landscape. IBR, but not IED, models were significantly associated with three measures of gene flow (Nm from FST, BayesAss+ and Migrate-n) after factoring out the influence of isolation by distance using partial Mantel tests. Predicted corridors for gene flow between city parks were largely narrow, linear parklands or vegetated spaces that are not managed for wildlife, such as cemeteries and roadway medians. These results have implications for understanding the impacts of urbanization trends on native wildlife, as well as for urban reforestation efforts that aim to improve urban ecosystem processes.

AB Background: Poorly regulated international trade in ornamental fishes poses risks to both biodiversity and economic activity via invasive alien species and exotic pathogens. Border security officials need robust tools to confirm identifications, often requiring hard-to-obtain taxonomic literature and expertise. DNA barcoding offers a potentially attractive tool for quarantine inspection, but has yet to be scrutinised for aquarium fishes. Here, we present a barcoding approach for ornamental cyprinid fishes by: (1) expanding current barcode reference libraries; (2) assessing barcode congruence with morphological identifications under numerous scenarios (e. g. inclusion of GenBank data, presence of singleton species, choice of analytical method); and (3) providing supplementary information to identify difficult species.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: We sampled 172 ornamental cyprinid fish species from the international trade, and provide data for 91 species currently unrepresented in reference libraries (GenBank/Bold). DNA barcodes were found to be highly congruent with our morphological assignments, achieving success rates of 90-99%, depending on the method used (neighbour-joining monophyly, bootstrap, nearest neighbour, GMYC, percent threshold). Inclusion of data from GenBank (additional 157 spp.) resulted in a more comprehensive library, but at a cost to success rate due to the increased number of singleton species. In addition to DNA barcodes, our study also provides supporting data in the form of specimen images, morphological characters, taxonomic bibliography, preserved vouchers, and nuclear rhodopsin sequences. Using this nuclear rhodopsin data we also uncovered evidence of interspecific hybridisation, and highlighted unrecognised diversity within popular aquarium species, including the endangered Indian barb Puntius denisonii.
   Conclusions/Significance: We demonstrate that DNA barcoding provides a highly effective biosecurity tool for rapidly identifying ornamental fishes. In cases where DNA barcodes are unable to offer an identification, we improve on previous studies by consolidating supplementary information from multiple data sources, and empower biosecurity agencies to confidently identify high-risk fishes in the aquarium trade.

AB Rubisco limits photosynthetic CO2 fixation because of its low catalytic turnover rate (k(cat)) and competing oxygenase reaction. Previous attempts to improve the catalytic efficiency of Rubisco by genetic engineering have gained little progress. Here we demonstrate that the introduction of the small subunit (RbcS) of high k(cat) Rubisco from the C-4 plant sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) significantly enhances k(cat) of Rubisco in transgenic rice (Oryza sativa). Three independent transgenic lines expressed sorghum RbcS at a high level, accounting for 30%, 44%, and 79% of the total RbcS. Rubisco was likely present as a chimera of sorghum and rice RbcS, and showed 1.32- to 1.50-fold higher k(cat) than in nontransgenic rice. Rubisco from transgenic lines showed a higher K-m for CO2 and slightly lower specificity for CO2 than nontransgenic controls. These results suggest that Rubisco in rice transformed with sorghum RbcS partially acquires the catalytic properties of sorghum Rubisco. Rubisco content in transgenic lines was significantly increased over wild-type levels but Rubisco activation was slightly decreased. The expression of sorghum RbcS did not affect CO2 assimilation rates under a range of CO2 partial pressures. The J(max)/V-cmax ratio was significantly lower in transgenic line compared to the nontransgenic plants. These observations suggest that the capacity of electron transport is not sufficient to support the increased Rubisco capacity in transgenic rice. Although the photosynthetic rate was not enhanced, the strategy presented here opens the way to engineering Rubisco for improvement of photosynthesis and productivity in the future.

AB Climate change is affecting biodiversity worldwide inducing species to either "move, adapt or die". In this paper we propose a conceptual framework for analysing range shifts, namely a catalogue of the possible patterns of change in the distribution of a species along elevational or other environmental gradients and an improved quantitative methodology to identify and objectively describe these patterns. Patterns are defined in terms of changes occurring at the leading, trailing or both edges of the distribution: (a) leading edge expansion, (b) trailing edge retraction, (c) range expansion, (d) optimum shift, (e) expansion, (f) retraction, and (g) shift. The methodology is based on the modelling of species distributions along a gradient using generalized additive models (GAMs). Separate models are calibrated for two distinct periods of assessment and response curves are compared over five reference points. Changes occurred at these points are formalized into a code that ultimately designates the corresponding change pattern. We tested the proposed methodology using data from the Swiss national common breeding bird survey. The elevational distributions of 95 bird species were modelled for the periods 1999-2002 and 2004-2007 and significant upward shifts (all patterns confounded) were identified for 35% of the species. Over the same period, an increase in mean temperature was registered for Switzerland. In consideration of the short period covered by the case study, assessed change patterns are considered to correspond to intermediate patterns in an ongoing shifting process. However, similar patterns can be determined by habitat barriers, land use/land cover changes, competition with concurrent or invasive species or different warming rates at different elevations.

AB In order to efficiently manage nonindigenous species (NIS), predictive tools are needed to prioritize locations where they are likely to become established and where their impacts will be most severe. While predicting the impact of a NIS has generally proved challenging, forecasting its abundance patterns across potential recipient locations should serve as a useful surrogate method of estimating the relative severity of the impacts to be expected. Yet such approaches have rarely been applied in invasion biology. We used long-term monitoring data for lakes within the state of Minnesota and artificial neural networks to model both the occurrence as well as the abundance of a widespread aquatic NIS, common carp (Cyprinus carpio). We then tested the ability of the resulting models to (1) interpolate to new sites within our main study region, (2) extrapolate to lakes in the neighboring state of South Dakota, and (3) assessed the relative contribution of each variable to model predictions. Our models correctly identified over 83% of sites where carp are either present or absent and explained 73% of the variation in carp abundance for validation lakes in Minnesota (i.e., lakes not used to build the model). When extrapolated to South Dakota, our models correctly classified carp occurrence in 79% of lakes and explained 32% of the variation in carp abundance. Variables related to climate and water quality were found to be the most important predictors of carp distribution. These results demonstrate that ecological niche-based modeling techniques can be used to forecast both the occurrence and abundance patterns of invasive species at a regional scale. Models also yielded sensible predictions when extrapolated to neighboring regions. Such predictions, when combined, should provide more useful estimates of the overall risk posed by NIS on potential recipient systems.

AB Genetic monitoring has rarely been used for wildlife translocations despite the potential benefits this approach offers, compared to traditional field-based methods. We applied genetic monitoring to the reintroduced brown bear population in northern Italy. From 2002 to 2008, 2781 hair and faecal samples collected noninvasively plus 12 samples obtained from captured or dead bears were used to follow the demographic and geographical expansion and changes in genetic composition. Individual genotypes were used to reconstruct the wild pedigree and revealed that the population increased rapidly, from nine founders to > 27 individuals in 2008 (lambda = 1.17-1.19). Spatial mapping of bear samples indicated that most bears were distributed in the region surrounding the translocation site; however, individual bears were found up to 163 km away. Genetic diversity in the population was high, with expected heterozygosity of 0.74-0.79 and allelic richness of 4.55-5.41. However, multi-year genetic monitoring data showed that mortality rates were elevated, immigration did not occur, one dominant male sired all cubs born from 2002 to 2005, genetic diversity declined, relatedness increased, inbreeding occurred, and the effective population size was extremely small (Ne = 3.03, ecological method). The comprehensive information collected through genetic monitoring is critical for implementing future conservation plans for the brown bear population in the Italian Alps. This study provides a model for other reintroduction programmes by demonstrating how genetic monitoring can be implemented to uncover aspects of the demography, ecology and genetics of small and reintroduced populations that will advance our understanding of the processes influencing their viability, evolution, and successful restoration.

AB Field experiments were carried out in two parts at the Luancheng Experimental Station in the North China Plain. Part 1, which was a continuous experiment that ran from 1990 to 2008, investigated the change of grain yield, evapotranspiration (ET), root size and soil water utilization of winter wheat (Triticum aestivurn L) under three water regimes (rain-fed, two and four irrigation applications). Part 11 used 10 cultivars released from 1970 to 2000 that were grown under the same condition for two seasons (2005/2006 and 2006/2007) to compare root size, root:shoot ratio and soil water depletion (SWD). The results of testing in Part I showed that the yield and ET of winter wheat gradually increased from 1990 to the present. There was no consistent change in total root length (TRL) over time. The difference in root size among seasons and irrigation treatments mainly occurred in the upper soil profile, where the root length density (RLD) was greater. No direct relationship was found between root size and soil water use. Thus, TRL was not a factor that indicated the water extracting capacity of crops. The results from Part 11 revealed that the seasonal ET of earlier released cultivars (ERC) was similar to that of recently released cultivars (RRC) under well-watered conditions, However, ET was slightly increased from ERC to RRC under water deficit conditions, indicating high soil water depletion by RRC. TRL decreased from ERC to RRC and was significantly correlated with plant height. The breeding of winter wheat that reduced plant height not only increased harvest index, but also reduced root size, resulting ill a smaller root:shoot ratio. The reduction in TRL from ERC to RRC mainly occurred in the top soil profile. The results from both tests indicate that TRL is not a factor that determines soil water use: rather, the distribution of RLD along the soil profile plays more important role in soil water utilization. Smaller root size in the upper soil layer did not affect soil water uptake, and might be more economical in terms of production efficiency. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI The evolutionary radiation of Arvicolinae rodents (voles and lemmings):
   relative contribution of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA phylogenies

AB Background: Mitochondrial and nuclear genes have generally been employed for different purposes in molecular systematics, the former to resolve relationships within recently evolved groups and the latter to investigate phylogenies at a deeper level. In the case of rapid and recent evolutionary radiations, mitochondrial genes like cytochrome b (CYB) are often inefficient for resolving phylogenetic relationships. One of the best examples is illustrated by Arvicolinae rodents (Rodentia; Muridae), the most impressive mammalian radiation of the Northern Hemisphere which produced voles, lemmings and muskrats. Here, we compare the relative contribution of a nuclear marker-the exon 10 of the growth hormone receptor (GHR) gene-to the one of the mitochondrial CYB for inferring phylogenetic relationships among the major lineages of arvicoline rodents.
   Results: The analysis of GHR sequences improves the overall resolution of the Arvicolinae phylogeny. Our results show that the Caucasian long-clawed vole (Prometheomys schaposnikowi) is one of the basalmost arvicolines, and confirm that true lemmings (Lemmus) and collared lemmings (Dicrostonyx) are not closely related as suggested by morphology. Red-backed voles (Myodini) are found as the sister-group of a clade encompassing water vole (Arvicola), snow vole (Chionomys), and meadow voles (Microtus and allies). Within the latter, no support is recovered for the generic recognition of Blanfordimys, Lasiopodomys, Neodon, and Phaiomys as suggested by morphology. Comparisons of parameter estimates for branch lengths, base composition, among sites rate heterogeneity, and GTR relative substitution rates indicate that CYB sequences consistently exhibit more heterogeneity among codon positions than GHR. By analyzing the contribution of each codon position to node resolution, we show that the apparent higher efficiency of GHR is due to their third positions. Although we focus on speciation events spanning the last 10 million years (Myr), CYB sequences display highly saturated codon positions contrary to the nuclear exon. Lastly, variable length bootstrap predicts a significant increase in resolution of arvicoline phylogeny through the sequencing of nuclear data in an order of magnitude three to five times greater than the size of GHR exon 10.
   Conclusion: Our survey provides a first resolved gene tree for Arvicolinae. The comparison of CYB and GHR phylogenetic efficiency supports recent assertions that nuclear genes are useful for resolving relationships of recently evolved animals. The superiority of nuclear exons may reside both in (i) less heterogeneity among sites, and (ii) the presence of highly informative sites in third codon positions, that evolve rapidly enough to accumulate synapomorphies, but slow enough to avoid substitutional saturation.

AB Many studies of phylogeography, speciation, and species limits restrict their focus to a narrow issue: gene tree monophyly. However, reciprocal monophyly does not provide an ideal touchstone criterion of any aspect of evolutionary divergence. There is a continuum of divergence stages as isolated populations go from initial allele frequency differences to well-differentiated species. Studying intermediate stages of divergence will increase our understanding of geographical speciation, species limits, and conservation priorities. We develop a conceptual framework and terminology for thinking about the stages of 'intermediate polyphyly'. The Holarctic clade of common ravens (Corvus corax), found throughout much of Eurasia and North America, provides a case study of these stages of intermediate divergence. We used coalescent, phylogenetic, and population genetic methods to investigate the history and current status of this Old World-New World distribution using 107 mitochondrial control region sequences. Phylogenetically, New World and Old World samples are intermixed. However, most samples are grouped into small subclades that are restricted to either the New World or the Old World, and only one haplotype is shared between the hemispheres. Analysis of moleculalr variance (AMOVA) results reflect this low haplotype sharing between hemispheres (Phi(ST) = 0.13, P < 0.01). Isolation with Migration (IM) coalescent results suggest a sustained period of divergence between the hemispheres and low levels of maternal gene flow. Although there has not been sufficient time to evolve reciprocal monophyly and some gene flow may occur, New World and Old World ravens are genetically quite distinct. We use this example to demonstrate these early stages of divergence as populations go from sharing only internal haplotypes, to sharing no haplotypes, to having population specific subclades. Studies of phylogeography, speciation and systematics will benefit from increased attention to these stages of intermediate polyphyly.

AB The genetics of marine populations is a subject that has made little progress compared with the effort spent on the terrestrial environment. This is so despite "applied" aspects such as stock management, marine aquaculture, creation of reserves, conservation of the coastal zones, taxonomy, and protection of species. The crowded and dispersive marine environment, with its steep physical gradients, favours the existence of a planktonic larval stage for most species. The attendant high fecundity has important consequences for selection differentials and dispersal and therefore for the evolution of genetic structures. These features must be taken into account in order to understand the origin and maintenance of marine biodiversity and, in some cases, to manage it. In this article, after a definition of genetic diversity among other aspects of biodiversity, special features of the marine environment and processes governing genetic diversity are given together with the molecular tools required to study it. Then, an overview of the interesting scientific questions in marine biodiversity research is given concerning:Errorthe population structure as a function of dispersal systems and spatial constraints: gene flow and speciation in a dispersive environment, Errorthe phylogeography and historical biogeography of marine ecosystems; Errorthe functional and adaptive aspects of polymorphism: larval phase and genetic control of recruitment. Some uses of genetic diversity for assessment, conservation and protection purposes are also detailed. Organismal (specific) diversity does not enter the scope of the article.

AB Although a high biomass yield is obtained from established Miscanthus crops, previous studies have shown that fertilizer requirements are relatively low. As little information on the role of the Miscanthus roots in nutrient acquisition is available, a study was conducted to gather data on the Miscanthus root system and root nutrient content. Therefore in 1992, the root distribution pattern of an established Miscanthus crop was measured in held trials using the trench profile and the auger methods. Also, in 1994/1995, seasonal changes in root length density (RLD) and root nutrient content were monitored three times during the vegetation period.
   The trench profile method showed that roots were present to the maximum depth measured of 250 cm. The top soil (0-30 cm) contained 28% of root biomass, while nearly half of the total roots were present in soil layers deeper than 90 cm. Using the auger method, we found that RLD values in the topsoil decreased with increasing distance from the centre of the plants. Below 30 cm, RLD decreased markedly, and differences in root length in the soil between plants were less pronounced. The total root dry weight down to 180 cm tended to increase from May 1994 (10.6 t ha(-1)) to November 1994 (13.9 t ha(-1)) and then decreased again until March 1995 (11.5 t ha(-1)). Nutrient concentrations in the roots decreased with increasing depth. The concentrations of N (0.7-1.4%) and K (0.6-1.2%) were clearly higher than those of P (0.06-0.17%). The mean values for N, P and K contents of the roots of all three sampling dates in 1994/1995 were 109.2 kg N ha(-1), 10.6 kg P ha(-1) and 92.5 kg K ha(-1).
   Although our results showed that RLD values for Miscanthus in the topsoil are lower than for annual crops, the greater rooting depth and the higher RLD of Miscanthus in the subsoil mean that nutrient uptake from the subsoil is potentially greater. This enables Miscanthus crops to overcome periods of low nutrient (and water) availability especially during periods of rapid above-ground biomass growth. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB The photosynthetic rates and various components of photosynthesis including ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase (Rubisco; EC 4.1.1.39), chlorophyll (Chi), cytochrome (Cyt) f, and coupling factor 1 (CF1) contents, and sucrose-phosphate synthase (SPS; EC 2.4.1.14) activity were examined in young, fully expanded leaves of rice (Oryza sativa L.) grown hydroponically under two irradiances, namely, 1000 and 350 mu mol quanta.m(-2).s(-1), at three N concentrations. The light-saturated rate of photosynthesis measured at 1800 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1) was almost the same for a given leaf N content irrespective of growth irradiance. Similarly, Rubisco content and SPS activity were not different for the same leaf N content between irradiance treatments. In contrast, Chi content was significantly greater in the plants grown at 350 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1), whereas Cyt f and CF1 contents tended to be slightly smaller. However, these changes were not substantial, as shown by the fact that the light-limited rate of photosynthesis measured at 350 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1) was the same or only a little higher in the plants grown at 350 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1) and that CO2-saturated photosynthesis did not differ between irradiance treatments. These results indicate that growth-irradiance-dependent changes in N partitioning in a leaf were far from optimal with respect to N-use efficiency of photosynthesis. In spite of the difference in growth irradiance, the relative growth rate of the whole plant did not differ between the treatments because there was an increase in the leaf area ratio in the low-irradiance-grown plants. This increase was associated with the preferential N-investment in leaf blades and the extremely low accumulation of starch and sucrose in leaf blades and sheaths, allowing a more efficient use of the fixed carbon. Thus, morphogenic responses at the whole-plant level may be more important for plants as an adaptation strategy to light environments than a response of N partitioning at the level of a single leaf.

AB We used a complete block design to experimentally study direct and indirect interactions in a three trophic-level freshwater system consisting of a top predator, the green sunfish, Lepomis cyanellus, an intermediate predator, small-mouthed salamander larvae, Ambystoma barbouri, and prey, hatchling isopods, Lirceus fontinalis. This system occurs naturally in small stream pools in central Kentucky; experiments were done in laboratory pools. Salamander larvae ate isopods and thus had a direct, negative effect on isopod survival. Accordingly, isopods responded to the presence of salamander larvae by increasing their tendency to bury themselves in the sand substrate. Fish ate salamanders and thus had a direct, negative effect on salamander survival. Salamanders responded to fish presence by increasing their time spent under plexiglass plates that simulate refuge rocks. The overall effect of fish on isopods depended on the presence of salamanders. In the absence of salamanders, fish predation on isopods had a direct, negative effect on isopod survival; isopods thus responded to the presence of fish by burying themselves in the sand. With salamanders present, fish had a positive overall effect on isopod survival; i.e., direct, negative effects of fish on isopods were outweighed by indirect, positive effects. Indirect positive effects of fish on isopods came through a reduction in salamander predation rates on isopods in the presence of fish. The mechanism involved both a decrease in the number of salamanders (a trophic-linkage indirect effect; cf. Miller and Kerfoot 1987) and a reduction in the feeding rate of individual salamanders on isopods (a behavioral indirect effect). The decrease in individual salamander feeding rates on isopods was due to reductions in both salamander activity and in spatial overlap between salamanders and isopods in the presence of fish. The latter effect reflected the fact that salamanders and isopods used different refuges from fish; salamanders went under refuge plates, whereas isopods primarily buried themselves in sand. Estimates of the relative importance of various direct and indirect effects of sunfish on isopods suggested that positive, behavioral indirect effects were of roughly the same magnitude as direct, negative effects, both of which were more important than were trophic-linkage indirect effects. Contrary to expectations, the presence of isopods did not affect the refuge use or survival of salamanders in the presence of fish.

AB Land degradation is a global issue receiving much attention currently. In order to objectively reveal the research situation of land degradation, bibliometrix and biblioshiny software packages have been used to conduct data mining and quantitative analysis on research papers in the fields of land degradation during 1990-2019 (data update time was 8 April 2019) in the Web of Science core collection database. The results show that: (1) during the past 20 years, the number of papers on land degradation has increased. According to the number of articles, it is divided into four stages: a low-production exploration period, a developmental sprout period, expansion of the promotion period, and a high-yield active period. (2) Land-degradation research covers 93 countries or regions. The top five countries in terms of research volume are China, the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, and Australia. China, the United States, and the United Kingdom are the most important countries for international cooperation in the field of land degradation. However, cooperation between countries is not very close overall. (3) Land degradation, degradation, desertification, remote sensing, soil erosion, and soil degradation are high-frequency keywords in the field of land degradation in recent years. (4) The research hotspots in the field of land degradation mainly focus on research directions such as restoration and reconstruction of land degradation, and sustainable management of land resources. (5) The themes of various periods in the field of land degradation are diversified, and the evolutionary relationship is complex. There are 15 evolutionary paths with regard to dynamic monitoring of land degradation, environmental governance of land degradation, and responses of land degradation to land-use change. Finally, the paper concludes that the research directions on land degradation in future include the process, mechanism, and effect of land degradation, the application of new technologies, new monitoring methods for land degradation, theory enhancement, methods and models of ecological restoration, reconstruction of degraded land, multidisciplinary integrated system research, constructing a policy guarantee system for the reconstruction of degraded land, and strengthening research on land resource engineering.

AB Aims Vegetation-plot records provide information on the presence and cover or abundance of plants co-occurring in the same community. Vegetation-plot data are spread across research groups, environmental agencies and biodiversity research centers and, thus, are rarely accessible at continental or global scales. Here we present the sPlot database, which collates vegetation plots worldwide to allow for the exploration of global patterns in taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic diversity at the plant community level. Results sPlot version 2.1 contains records from 1,121,244 vegetation plots, which comprise 23,586,216 records of plant species and their relative cover or abundance in plots collected worldwide between 1885 and 2015. We complemented the information for each plot by retrieving climate and soil conditions and the biogeographic context (e.g., biomes) from external sources, and by calculating community-weighted means and variances of traits using gap-filled data from the global plant trait database TRY. Moreover, we created a phylogenetic tree for 50,167 out of the 54,519 species identified in the plots. We present the first maps of global patterns of community richness and community-weighted means of key traits. Conclusions The availability of vegetation plot data in sPlot offers new avenues for vegetation analysis at the global scale.

AB Plant adaptation to drought has been extensively studied at many scales from ecology to molecular biology across a large range of model species. However, the conceptual frameworks underpinning the definition of plant strategies, and the terminology used across the different disciplines and scales are not analogous. Drought resistance' for instance refers to plant responses as different as the maintenance of growth and productivity in crops, to the survival and recovery in perennial woody or grassland species. Therefore, this paper aims to propose a unified conceptual framework of plant adaptive strategies to drought based on a revised terminology in order to enhance comparative studies. Ecological strategies encapsulate plant adaptation to multidimensional variation in resource variability but cannot account for the dynamic and short-term responses to fluctuations in water availability. Conversely, several plant physiological strategies have been identified along the mono-dimensional gradient of water availability in a given environment. According to a revised terminology, dehydration escape, dehydration avoidance, dehydration tolerance, dormancy, and desiccation tolerance are clearly distinguishable. Their sequential expression is expressed as water deficit increases while cavitation tolerance is proposed here to be a major hydraulic strategy underpinning adaptive responses to drought of vascular plants. This continuum of physiological strategies can be interpreted in the context of the ecological trade-off between water-acquisition vs. water-conservation, since growth maintenance is associated with fast water use under moderate drought while plant survival after growth cessation is associated with slow water use under severe drought. Consequently, the distinction between drought resistance' and drought survival', is emphasized as crucial to ensure a correct interpretation of plant strategies since knowing when not to grow' does not confer drought resistance' but may well enhance drought survival'. This framework proposal should improve cross-fertilization between disciplines to help tackle the increasing worldwide challenges that drought poses to plant adaptation.

AB Background: As a recently discovered member of the DPANN superphylum, Woesearchaeota account for a wide diversity of 16S rRNA gene sequences, but their ecology, evolution, and metabolism remain largely unknown.
   Results: Here, we assembled 133 global clone libraries/studies and 19 publicly available genomes to profile these patterns for Woesearchaeota. Phylogenetic analysis shows a high diversity with 26 proposed subgroups for this recently discovered archaeal phylum, which are widely distributed in different biotopes but primarily in inland anoxic environments. Ecological patterns analysis and ancestor state reconstruction for specific subgroups reveal that oxic status of the environments is the key factor driving the distribution and evolutionary diversity of Woesearchaeota. A selective distribution to different biotopes and an adaptive colonization from anoxic to oxic environments can be proposed and supported by evidence of the presence of ferredoxin-dependent pathways in the genomes only from anoxic biotopes but not from oxic biotopes. Metabolic reconstructions support an anaerobic heterotrophic lifestyle with conspicuous metabolic deficiencies, suggesting the requirement for metabolic complementarity with other microbes. Both lineage abundance distribution and co-occurrence network analyses across diverse biotopes confirmed metabolic complementation and revealed a potential syntrophic relationship between Woesearchaeota and methanogens, which is supported by metabolic modeling. If correct, Woesearchaeota may impact methanogenesis in inland ecosystems.
   Conclusions: The findings provide an ecological and evolutionary framework for Woesearchaeota at a global scale and indicate their potential ecological roles, especially in methanogenesis.

AB The ongoing changes to climate challenge the conservation of forest biodiversity. Yet, in thermally limited systems, such as temperate forests, not all species groups might be affected negatively. Furthermore, simultaneous changes in the disturbance regime have the potential to mitigate climate-related impacts on forest species. Here, we (i) investigated the potential long-term effect of climate change on biodiversity in a mountain forest landscape, (ii) assessed the effects of different disturbance frequencies, severities and sizes and (iii) identified biodiversity hotspots at the landscape scale to facilitate conservation management. We employed the model iLand to dynamically simulate the tree vegetation on 13865ha of the Kalkalpen National Park in Austria over 1000years, and investigated 36 unique combinations of different disturbance and climate scenarios. We used simulated changes in tree cover and composition as well as projected temperature and precipitation to predict changes in the diversity of Araneae, Carabidae, ground vegetation, Hemiptera, Hymenoptera, Mollusca, saproxylic beetles, Symphyta and Syrphidae, using empirical response functions. Our findings revealed widely varying responses of biodiversity indicators to climate change. Five indicators showed overall negative effects, with Carabidae, saproxylic beetles and tree species diversity projected to decrease by more than 33%. Six indicators responded positively to climate change, with Hymenoptera, Mollusca and Syrphidae diversity projected to increase more than twofold. Disturbances were generally beneficial for the studied indicators of biodiversity. Our results indicated that increasing disturbance frequency and severity have a positive effect on biodiversity, while increasing disturbance size has a moderately negative effect. Spatial hotspots of biodiversity were currently found in low- to mid-elevation areas of the mountainous study landscape, but shifted to higher-elevation zones under changing climate conditions.Synthesis and applications. Our results highlight that intensifying disturbance regimes may alleviate some of the impacts of climate change on forest biodiversity. However, the projected shift in biodiversity hotspots is a challenge for static conservation areas. In this regard, overlapping hotspots under current and expected future conditions highlight priority areas for robust conservation management.

AB Robust methods by which to generate virtual species are needed urgently in the emerging field of distributional ecology to evaluate performance of techniques for modeling ecological niches and species distributions and to generate new questions in biogeography. Virtual species provide the opportunity to test hypotheses and methods based on known and unbiased distributions. We present Niche Analyst (NicheA), a toolkit developed to generate virtual species following the Hutchinsonian approach of an n-multidimensional space occupied by the species. Ecological niche models are generated, analyzed, and visualized in an environmental space, and then projected to the geographic space in the form of continuous or binary species distribution models. NicheA is implemented in a stable and user-friendly Java platform. The software, online manual, and user support are freely available at <http://nichea.sourceforge.net>.

AB Mediterranean rivers are probably one of the most singular and endangered ecosystems worldwide due to the presence of many endemic species and a long history of anthropogenic impacts. Besides a conservation value per se, biodiversity is related to the services that ecosystems provide to society and the ability of these to cope with stressors, including climate change. Using macro-invertebrates and fish as sentinel organisms, this overview presents a synthesis of the state of the art in the application of biomarkers (stress and enzymatic responses, endocrine disruptors, trophic tracers, energy and bile metabolites, genotoxic indicators, histopathological and behavioural alterations, and genetic and cutting edge omic markers) to determine the causes and effects of anthropogenic stressors on the biodiversity of European Mediterranean rivers. We also discuss how a careful selection of sentinel species according to their ecological traits and the food-web structure of Mediterranean rivers could increase the ecological relevance of biomarker responses. Further, we provide suggestions to better harmonise ecological realism with experimental design in biomarker studies, including statistical analyses, which may also deliver a more comprehensible message to managers and policy makers. By keeping on the safe side the health status of populations of multiple-species in a community, we advocate to increase the resilience of fluvial ecosystems to face present and forecasted stressors. In conclusion, this review provides evidence that multi-biomarker approaches detect early signs of impairment in populations, and supports their incorporation in the standardised procedures of the Water Frame Work Directive to better appraise the status of European water bodies.

AB Aim The increased incidence of large fires around much of the world in recent decades raises questions about human and non-human drivers of fire and the likelihood of increased fire activity in the future. The purpose of this paper is to outline a conceptual framework for examining where human-set fires and feedbacks are likely to be most pronounced in temperate forests world-wide and to establish and test a methodology for evaluating this framework using palaeoecological records.
   Location Tasmania, north-western USA, southern South America and New Zealand.
   Methods We outline a conceptual framework for predicting the sensitivity of ecosystems to human impacts on fire regimes and then use a circum-Pacific comparison of existing historical reconstructions of fire, climate, human settlement and vegetation to evaluate this approach.
   Results Previous research investigating important controls on fire activity shows that the sensitivity of temperate ecosystems to human-set fires is modulated by the frequency of natural fire occurrence, fuel moisture and fuel type and availability. Palaeoecological data from four temperate regions suggest that the effects of anthropogenic burning are greatest where fire is naturally rare, vegetation is poorly adapted to fire and fuel biomass is abundant and contiguous. Alternatively, where fire activity is naturally high and vegetation is well adapted to fire, evidence of human influence on fire and vegetation is less obvious.
   Main conclusions Palaeofire records suggest that the most dynamic and persistent ecosystem transitions occur where human activities increase landscape flammability through fire-vegetation feedbacks. Rapid forest transitions in biomassrich ecosystems such as New Zealand and areas of Tasmania and southern South America illustrate how landscapes experiencing few fires can shift past tipping points to become fire-prone landscapes with new alternative stable state communities. Comparisons of palaeoecological data from different regions with similar biophysical gradients but different human settlement histories can provide new opportunities for understanding ecosystem vulnerability to fire-climate-human interactions.

AB Understanding species distributions and the factors limiting them is an important topic in ecology and conservation, including in nature reserve selection and predicting climate change impacts. While Species Distribution Models (SDM) are the main tool used for these purposes, choosing the best SDM algorithm is not straightforward as these are plentiful and can be applied in many different ways. SDM are used mainly to gain insight in 1) overall species distributions, 2) their pastpresent-future probability of occurrence and/or 3) to understand their ecological niche limits (also referred to as ecological niche modelling). The fact that these three aims may require different models and outputs is, however, rarely considered and has not been evaluated consistently. Here we use data from a systematically sampled set of species occurrences to specifically test the performance of Species Distribution Models across several commonly used algorithms. Species range in distribution patterns from rare to common and from local to widespread. We compare overall model fit (representing species distribution), the accuracy of the predictions at multiple spatial scales, and the consistency in selection of environmental correlations all across multiple modelling runs. As expected, the choice of modelling algorithm determines model outcome. However, model quality depends not only on the algorithm, but also on the measure of model fit used and the scale at which it is used. Although model fit was higher for the consensus approach and Maxent, Maxent and GAM models were more consistent in estimating local occurrence, while RF and GBM showed higher consistency in environmental variables selection. Model outcomes diverged more for narrowly distributed species than for widespread species. We suggest that matching study aims with modelling approach is essential in Species Distribution Models, and provide suggestions how to do this for different modelling aims and species' data characteristics (i.e. sample size, spatial distribution).

AB A data set of observed fire weather in Australia from 19732010 is analysed for trends using the McArthur Forest Fire Danger Index (FFDI). Annual cumulative FFDI, which integrates daily fire weather across the year, increased significantly at 16 of 38 stations. Annual 90th percentile FFDI increased significantly at 24 stations over the same period. None of the stations examined recorded a significant decrease in FFDI. There is an overall bias in the number of significant increases towards the southeast of the continent, while the largest trends occur in the interior of the continent and the smallest occur near the coast. The largest increases in seasonal FFDI occurred during spring and autumn, although with different spatial patterns, while summer recorded the fewest significant trends. These trends suggest increased fire weather conditions at many locations across Australia, due to both increased magnitude of FFDI and a lengthened fire season. Although these trends are consistent with projected impacts of climate change on FFDI, this study cannot separate the influence of climate change, if any, with that of natural variability.

AB Rising sea-surface temperatures (SSTs) over the last three decades in the south-eastern part of the Bay of Biscay could be affecting phytobenthic assemblage distributions. This study assesses recent changes in species abundance and diversity along the western Basque coast by studying 18 locations in summer 1991 and in 2008. There were substantial changes in the structure of subtidal vegetation between the two surveys: 1) an increase in coralline algae; 2) changes in the distribution patterns of the canopy species; 3) disappearance of kelps; 4) increases in warm-water species, mainly morphologically simple forms; 5) introduction and expansion of non-indigenous species, and 6) increases in species richness and diversity. These results are consistent with the rise detected in SST, particularly in summer when SST was found to have risen by as much as 1 degrees C from 1980 to 2008. Furthermore, two extreme warming events occurred in the summers of 2003 and 2006. However, some biological shifts cannot be explained by warmer waters alone. Only limited data are available on changes in nutrient concentrations and water transparency, but these factors are also thought to be involved in the biological changes detected.

AB Research has delivered convincing findings on the effect of biodiversity on ecosystem functioning and humankind. Indeed, ecosystems provide provisioning, regulating, supporting, and cultural services. The global value of annual ecosystem services of grasslands and rangelands is about US$ 232 ha(-1) year(-1). Nevertheless, the precise evaluation of biodiversity benefits remains challenging. This issue is due to valuation methods, subjective assumptions, and complexity of drivers of plant community dynamics. Here, we review the primary factors that influence plant diversity of permanent grasslands, and we describe underlying processes. These factors must indeed be identified to focus policies meant to preserve and restore plant diversity and to advise farmers about efficient decision rules. We show that plant dynamics of permanent grasslands cannot be explained simply by agricultural management rules, e.g., grazing, fertilization, and mowing, implemented at the field scale. The configuration of the surrounding landscape, e.g., landscape heterogeneity, habitat fragmentation, and connectivity, acts as a species filter that defines the regional species pool and controls seed flow. The regional species pool often contains higher species richness in a heterogeneous landscape, because of a higher diversity of suitable habitats. This regional pool could be a major species sources for permanent grasslands according to the seed flow. We discuss the need to consider all of these factors to understand plant species composition of permanent grasslands and the necessity to study plant communities using both taxonomic and functional approaches. In order to report this integrative approach, we propose a conceptual model based on three ecological challenges-dispersal, establishment, and persistence-that are considered to act as filters on plant diversity, and a graphical representation of the complexity of such studies due to the interaction effects between plant dispersal abilities, forage productivity, disturbances induced by farming practices, and landscape heterogeneity on plant diversity. Last, we discuss the ability of farmers to manage each factor and the necessity of such study in the improvement of the current agro-environment schemes efficiency for farmland biodiversity restoration or preservation.

AB A wide variety of data analysis techniques have been applied for quantitative assessment of coastal marine eutrophication. Indicators for assessing eutrophication and frequency distributions have been used to develop scales for characterizing oligotrophy and eutrophication. Numerical classification has also contributed to the assessment of eutrophic trends by grouping sampling sites of similar trophic conditions. Applications of eutrophication assessment based on Principal Component Analysis and Multidimensional Scaling have also been carried out. In addition, the rapid development of Geographical Information Systems has provided the framework for applications of spatial methods and mapping techniques on eutrophication studies. Satellite data have also contributed to eutrophication assessment especially at large scale. Multiple criteria analysis methods can integrate eutrophication variables together with socio-economic parameters providing a holistic approach particularly useful to policy makers. As the current concept of eutrophication problems is to be examined as part of a coastal management approach, more complex quantitative procedures are needed to provide a platform useful for implementation of environmental policy. The present work reviews methods of data analysis used for the assessment of coastal marine eutrophication. The difficulties in applying these methods on data collected from the marine environment are discussed as well as the future perspectives of spatial and multiple criteria choice methods.

AB Species are impacted by climate change at both ecological and evolutionary time scales. Studies in northern continents have provided abundant evidence of dramatic shifts in distributions of species subsequent to the last glacial maximum (LGM), particularly at high latitudes. However, little is known about the history of southern continents, especially at high latitudes. South America is the only continent, other than Antarctica, that extends beyond 40 degrees S. Genetic studies of a few Patagonian species have provided seemingly conflicting results, indicating either postglacial colonization from restricted glacial refugia or persistence through glacial cycles and in situ differentiation. Using mitochondrial DNA sequences of 14 species of sigmodontine rodents, a major faunal ensemble of Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego, we show that at least nine of these species bear genetic footprints of demographic expansion from single restricted sources. However, timing of demographic expansion precedes the LGM in most of these species. Four species are fragmented phylogeographically within the region. Our results indicate that (i) demographic instability in response to historical climate change has been widespread in the Patagonian-Fueguian region, and is generally more pronounced at high latitudes in both southern and northern continents; (ii) colonization from lower latitudes is an important component of current Patagonian-Fueguian diversity; but (iii) in situ differentiation has also contributed to species diversity.

AB The importance of genetic variation for maintaining biological diversity and evolutionary processes has been recognized by researchers for decades. This realization has prompted agreements by world leaders to conserve genetic diversity, and this is an explicit goal of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). Nevertheless, very limited action has been taken to protect genetic diversity on a global scale. International conservation efforts to halt biodiversity loss focus on habitats and species, whereas little or no attention is paid to gene level variation. By this year, 2010, world leaders have agreed that a significant reduction of the rate of biodiversity loss should have been achieved. However, gene level diversity is still not monitored, indicators that can help identify threats to genetic variation are missing, and there is no strategy for how genetic aspects can be included in biodiversity targets beyond 2010. Important findings and conclusions from decades of conservation genetic research are not translated into concrete conservation action in the arena of international policy development. There is an urgent need for conservation geneticists worldwide to become involved in policy and practical conservation work beyond the universities and research institutions.

AB Various management approaches have been proposed to address the alarming depletion of marine coastal resources. Prominent among them are community-based management and the establishment of marine protected areas (MPAs). The overall poor performance of MPAs can be traced to a failure to effectively include local communities in the design and implementation of relevant measures. Recent efforts have incorporated aspects of community-based management into a hybrid form of management, which ideally builds upon existing local management practices. A key challenge lies in the development of appropriate frameworks that allow for the successful participation of local communities in management. A review of studies on MPA design and community-based marine resource management and fieldwork observations provides suggestions on how to address current socioeconomic shortcomings in MPA design and implementation, successfully involving local communities in order to provide a better local basis for effective larger MPA networks. A combination of MPA tools as the formal frame and community-based natural resource management as the adaptive core that recognizes local communities as allies, not aliens, is needed to develop successful conservation approaches.

AB The objective of this study was to develop a rapid non-destructive technique to estimate total chlorophyll (Chl) content in a maize canopy using Chl content in a single leaf. The approach was (1) to calibrate and validate a reflectance-based non-destructive technique to estimate leaf Chl in maize; (2) to quantify the relative contribution of each leaf Chl to the total Chl in the canopy; and (3) to establish a relationship between leaf Chl. content and total. Chl in a maize canopy. The Red Edge Chlorophyll Index Cl-red (edge) = (R-NIR/R-red edge)-1 based on reflectances, R, in the red edge (720-730nm) and near infrared (770-800nm) was found to be an accurate measure of maize leaf Chl. It was able to predict leaf Chl ranging from 10 to 805 mg Chl m(-2) with root mean-square error less than 38 mg Chl m(-2). Relationships between Chl content in each maize leaf and total canopy Chl content were established and showed that Chl. in the collar leaf before silking or ear leaves explained more than 80% and 87% of the variation in totat Chl in a maize canopy, respectively. Thus, non-destructive measurements of both reflectance and area of a single leaf (either collar or ear) can be used to accurately estimate totat Chl content in a maize canopy. (C) 2008 Elsevier GmbH.

AB We investigated the thermal acclimation of photosynthesis and respiration in black spruce seedlings [Picea mariana (Mill.) B.S.P.] grown at 22/14 degrees C [low temperature (LT)] or 30/22 degrees C [high temperature (HT)] day/night temperatures. Net CO2 assimilation rates (A(net)) were greater in LT than in HT seedlings below 30 degrees C, but were greater in HT seedlings above 30 degrees C. Dark and day respiration rates were similar between treatments at the respective growth temperatures. When respiration was factored out of the photosynthesis response to temperature, the resulting gross CO2 assimilation rates (A(gross)) was lower in HT than in LT seedlings below 30 degrees C, but was similar above 30 degrees C. The reduced A(gross) of HT seedlings was associated with lower needle nitrogen content, lower ribulose 1.5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) maximum carboxylation rates (V-cmax) and lower maximum electron transport rates (J(max)). Growth treatment did not affect V-cmax : J(max). Modelling of the CO2 response of photosynthesis indicated that LT seedlings at 40 degrees C might have been limited by heat lability of Rubisco activase, but that in HT seedlings, Rubisco capacity was limiting. In sum, thermal acclimation of A(net) was largely caused by reduced respiration and lower nitrogen investments in needles from HT seedlings. At 40 degrees C, photosynthesis in LT seedlings might be limited by Rubisco activase capacity, while in HT seedlings, acclimation removed this limitation.

TI Glacial vicariance in Eurasia: mitochondrial DNA evidence from Scots
   pine for a complex heritage involving genetically distinct refugia at
   mid-northern latitudes and in Asia Minor

AB Background: At the last glacial maximum, Fennoscandia was covered by an ice sheet while the tundra occupied most of the rest of northern Eurasia. More or less disjunct refugial populations of plants were dispersed in southern Europe, often trapped between mountain ranges and seas. Genetic and paleobotanical evidences indicate that these populations have contributed much to Holocene recolonization of more northern latitudes. Less supportive evidence has been found for the existence of glacial populations located closer to the ice margin. Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) is a nordic conifer with a wide natural range covering much of Eurasia. Fractures in its extant genetic structure might be indicative of glacial vicariance and how different refugia contributed to the current distribution at the continental level. The population structure of Scots pine was investigated on much of its Eurasian natural range using maternally inherited mitochondrial DNA polymorphisms.
   Results: A novel polymorphic region of the Scots pine mitochondrial genome has been identified, the intron 1 of nad7, with three variants caused by insertions-deletions. From 986 trees distributed among 54 populations, four distinct multi-locus mitochondrial haplotypes (mitotypes) were detected based on the three nad7 intron 1 haplotypes and two previously reported size variants for nad1 intron B/C. Population differentiation was high (G(ST) = 0.657) and the distribution of the mitotypes was geographically highly structured, suggesting at least four genetically distinct ancestral lineages. A cosmopolitan lineage was widely distributed in much of Europe throughout eastern Asia. A previously reported lineage limited to the Iberian Peninsula was confirmed. A new geographically restricted lineage was found confined to Asia Minor. A new lineage was restricted to more northern latitudes in northeastern Europe and the Baltic region.
   Conclusion: The contribution of the various ancestral lineages to the current distribution of Scots pine was asymmetric and extant endemism reflected the presence of large geographic barriers to migration. The results suggest a complex biogeographical history with glacial refugia shared with temperate plant species in southern European Peninsulas and Asia Minor, and a genetically distinct glacial population located more North. These results confirm recent observations for cold tolerant species about the possible existence of refugial populations at mid-northern latitudes contributing significantly to the recolonization of northern Europe. Thus, Eurasian populations of nordic plant species might not be as genetically homogenous as assumed by simply considering them as offsets of glacial populations located in southern peninsulas. As such, they might have evolved distinctive genetic adaptations during glacial vicariance, worth evaluating and considering for conservation.

AB The objective of this study was to determine the relationship, or lack thereof, between growth and diversity of tree species and size in conifer stands of western North America. Growth was measured by net basal area growth and its components: survivor growth, recruitment, and mortality. The analysis used inventory data from permanent plots in the Douglas-fir/western hemlock forest type in Oregon and Washington, and in the mixed-conifer forest type in California. The methods consisted of generalized least square regression with spatial autocorrelation, controlling for the effect of other stand characteristics. Other things being equal, in the two forest types under study there was a strong positive relationship between net basal area growth and tree-species diversity. This effect was associated with higher recruitment in stands of higher tree-species diversity. Neither mortality nor growth of survivors was related to tree-species diversity. The relationship between growth and tree-size diversity was less clear. For Douglas-fir/western hemlock, net basal area growth was negatively correlated with tree-size diversity, essentially because recruitment was lower on plots of high tree-size diversity. For mixed conifers, net basal area growth tended also to be lower in plots of high tree-size diversity, but this was mostly because mortality was higher in plots of higher tree-size diversity.

AB Models of community regulation commonly incorporate gradients of disturbance inversely related to the role of biotic interactions in regulating intermediate trophic levels. Higher trophic-level organisms are predicted to be more strongly limited by intermediate levels of disturbance than are the organisms they consume. We used a manipulation of the frequency of hydrological disturbance in an intervention analysis to examine its effects on small-fish communities in the Everglades, USA. From 1978 to 2002, we monitored fishes at one long-hydroperiod (average 350 days) and at one short-hydroperiod (average 259 days; monitoring started here in 1985) site. At a third site, managers intervened in 1985 to diminish the frequency and duration of marsh drying. By the late 1990s, the successional dynamics of density and relative abundance at the intervention site converged on those of the long-hydroperiod site. Community change was manifested over 3 to 5 years following a dry-down if a site remained inundated; the number of days since the most recent drying event and length of the preceding dry period were useful for predicting population dynamics. Community dissimilarity was positively correlated with the time since last dry. Community dynamics resulted from change in the relative abundance of three groups of species linked by life-history responses to drought. Drought frequency and intensity covaried in response to hydrological manipulation at the landscape scale; community-level successional dynamics converged on a relatively small range of species compositions when drought return-time extended beyond 4 years. The density of small fishes increased with diminution of drought frequency, consistent with disturbance-limited community structure; less-frequent drying than experienced in this study (i.e., longer return times) yields predator-dominated regulation of small-fish communities in some parts of the Everglades.

AB Correlations between extractable leaf chlorophyll (Chl) concentration and portable, nondestructive leaf "greenness" meter readings imply that such estimates can be used as surrogate measurements of leaf nitrogen (N) status. However, few studies have actually found a direct relationship between Chl meter readings and leaf N. We evaluated the utility of two handheld transmittance-based Chl content meters (SPAD-502, Minolta Corp. and CCM-200, Opti-Sciences) and one reflectance-based meter (Observer, Spectrum Technologies), in estimating Chl and N concentrations in intact leaves of several citrus cultivars. Total Chl determined analytically, correlated well with nondestructive Chl meter readings (r(2): 0.72 to 0.97; P < 0.0001), but regression models differed among cultivars; using the same meter and also among meters for a given cultivar. The relationships were generally more linear and stronger at low Chl concentrations (< 0.5 mmol center dot m(-2)) than at higher Chl concentrations, reflecting increased variability in Chl meter readings with increasing leaf Chl. Significant relationships between Chl meter readings and measured leaf N concentrations were also found in all the cultivars tested (r(2): 0.23 to 0.69; P < 0.01), but the data were more variable than those for Chl. Field-grown leaves were significantly thicker and had higher Chl meter readings than greenhouse-grown leaves of similar Chl or N concentrations. The results suggest that nondestructive Chl content meters can overestimate Chl and N in thicker leaves and/or leaves with high Chl concentrations. A single prediction equation derived from a wide range of Chl or N concentrations could be applicable across the range of citrus cultivars when grown in the same environment. Potential limitations associated with leaf thickness as influenced by environmental factors may necessitate the development of more specific calibration equations.

AB Despite the fact that mollusc species play an important role in many aquatic ecosystems, little is known about their biodiversity and conservation genetics. Freshwater pearl mussel (Margaritifera margaritifera L.) populations are seriously declining all over Europe and a variety of conservation programs are being established to support the remaining endangered central European populations. In order to provide guidelines for conservation strategies and management programs, we investigated the genetic structure of 24 freshwater pearl mussel populations originating from five major central European drainages including Elbe, Danube, Rhine, Maas and Weser, representing the last and most important populations in this area. We present a nondestructive sampling method of haemolymph for DNA analyses, which is applicable for endangered bivalves. The analyses of nine microsatellite loci with different levels of polymorphism revealed a high degree of fragmented population structure and very different levels of genetic diversity within populations. These patterns can be explained by historical and demographic effects and have been enforced by anthropogenic activities. Even within drainages, distinct conservation units were detected, as revealed from high F-ST values, private alleles and genetic distance measures. Populations sampled close to contact zones between main drainage systems showed lowest levels of correct assignment to present-day drainage systems. Populations with high priority for conservation should not only be selected by means of census population size and geographical distance to other populations. Instead, detailed genetic analyses are mandatory for revealing differentiation and diversity parameters, which should be combined with ecological criteria for sustainable conservation and recovery programs.

AB Recent advances in DNA analysis have made it possible to identify a variety of forms of genetic variation in the chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes of plants and to analyze this variation at the population level. A review of population genetic theory for these uniparentally inherited non-recombining genomes indicates that they are likely to show low levels of intraspecific sequence variation in coding regions, and that targeting of alternative forms of variation (duplications, rearrangements) or non-coding regions of the genome with higher mutation rates may be necessary to detect useful genetic markers. The properties of the markers set limits to their utility in addressing population level and phylogenetic questions. By developing and applying appropriate population genetic theory it is possible to exploit the unique properties of organelle genomes to address previously intractable problems in plant ecology and evolution. The use of organelIe markers to study postglacial history, seed and pollen flow, and hybridization in plants are reviewed. A major limitation of genetic parameters estimated from analysis of organelle genomes is that they are based on unreplicated measurements. Each organelle genome behaves as if it were a single gene and provides only one piece of data. Population genetic analysis of organelIe markers is likely to be most fruitful when integrated with studies of traditional nuclear markers.

AB We report the methods and results of molecular genetic identification of the species and, in some cases, geographical origins of whale and dolphin products purchased from retail markets and restaurants in Japan and South Korea. As reported previously (Baker & Palumbi 1994), we used the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and a portable laboratory to amplify, purify and later sequence a portion of the mitochondrial DNA control region from 16 commercial products purchased in Japan. This 'spot check' revealed a surprising variety of species for sale, including minke, fin and humpback whales and one or two species of dolphins sold as 'kujira' or whale. In the Korean survey, DNA amplifications were conducted by two of us (C.S.B. and F.C.) working with independent equipment and reagents. The two sets of DNA amplifications were returned to our respective laboratories and sequenced independently for cross-validation. Among the total of 17 species-specific sequences we found a dolphin, a beaked whale, 13 Northern Hemisphere minke whales (representing at least seven distinct individuals) and two whales which are closely related to the recognized sei and Bryde's whales but could not be identified as either using available type sequences. We suggest that these two specimens represent a currently unrecognized species or subspecies of Bryde's whale, possibly the so-called 'small-form' reported from the tropical waters of the Indo-Pacific.
   We conclude that molecular systematic analyses of DNA sequences have tremendous utility for the identification of whale and dolphin products. However, there are certain constraints on the application of these techniques for monitoring whaling or trade in whale products. First, PCR and DNA sequencing can generate misleading artefacts. These can generally be recognized or eliminated through experimental controls. Second, phylogenetic reconstructions of DNA sequences can be misinterpreted if the database of type sequences is inadequate or the taxonomy of the group is incomplete. This constraint is, at present, a more serious obstacle to molecular monitoring of whaling. Our results high-light uncertainties about the taxonomic status of oceanic populations and morphological forms of two species (or species complexes) targeted by legal and illegal hunting, the minke and Bryde's whales. Despite these uncertainties, it is difficult to reconcile some of the species available in Japanese and Korean commercial markets with recent catch records made available to the International Whaling Commission. It is particularly disturbing that two specimens of an unrecognized species or subspecies of baleen whale were for sale in a restaurant in South Korea in October, 1994, 8 years after the acceptance of an international moratorium on commercial whaling.

AB Analytical chemists apply statistical methods for both the validation and prediction of proposed models. Methods are required that are adequate for finding the typical features of a dataset, such as nonlinearities and interactions. Boosted regression trees (BRTs), as an ensemble technique, are fundamentally different to other conventional techniques, with the aim to fit a single parsimonious model. In this work, BRT, artificial neural network (ANN) and response surface methodology (RSM) models have been used for the optimization and/or modeling of the stirring time (min), pH, adsorbent mass (mg) and concentrations of MB and Cd2+ ions (mg L-1) in order to develop respective predictive equations for simulation of the efficiency of MB and Cd2+ adsorption based on the experimental data set. Activated carbon, as an adsorbent, was synthesized from walnut wood waste which is abundant, non-toxic, cheap and locally available. This adsorbent was characterized using different techniques such as FT-IR, BET, SEM, point of zero charge (pHpzc) and also the determination of oxygen containing functional groups. The influence of various parameters (i.e. pH, stirring time, adsorbent mass and concentrations of MB and Cd2+ ions) on the percentage removal was calculated by investigation of sensitive function, variable importance rankings (BRT) and analysis of variance (RSM). Furthermore, a central composite design (CCD) combined with a desirability function approach (DFA) as a global optimization technique was used for the simultaneous optimization of the effective parameters. The applicability of the BRT, ANN and RSM models for the description of experimental data was examined using four statistical criteria (absolute average deviation (AAD), mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE) and coefficient of determination (R-2)). All three models demonstrated good predictions in this study. The BRT model was more precise compared to the other models and this showed that BRT could be a powerful tool for the modeling and optimizing of removal of MB and Cd(II). Sensitivity analysis (calculated from the weight of neurons in ANN) confirmed that the adsorbent mass and pH were the essential factors affecting the removal of MB and Cd(II), with relative importances of 28.82% and 38.34%, respectively. A good agreement (R-2 < 0.960) between the predicted and experimental values was obtained. Maximum removal (R% 4 99) was achieved at an initial dye concentration of 15 mg L-1, a Cd2+ concentration of 20 mg L-1, a pH of 5.2, an adsorbent mass of 0.55 g and a time of 35 min.

AB The deep-sea includes over 90% of the world's oceans and is thought to be one of the most diverse ecosystems in the world. It supplies society with valuable ecosystem services, including the provision of food, the regeneration of nutrients and the sequestration of carbon. Technological advancements in the second half of the 20th century made large-scale exploitation of mineral, hydrocarbon and fish resources possible. These economic activities, combined with climate change impacts, constitute a considerable threat to deep-sea biodiversity. Many governments, including that of the UK, have therefore decided to implement additional protected areas in their waters of national jurisdiction. To support the decision process and to improve our understanding for the acceptance of marine conservation plans across the general public, a choice experiment survey asked Scottish households for their willingness-to-pay for additional marine protected areas in the Scottish deep-sea. This study is one of the first to use valuation methodologies to investigate public preferences for the protection of deep-sea ecosystems. The experiment focused on the elicitation of economic values for two aspects of marine biodiversity: (i) the existence value for deep-sea species and (ii) the option value of deep-sea organisms as a source for future medicinal products.

AB The importance of the eukaryotic algal CO2-concentrating mechanism (CCM) is considered in terms of global productivity as well as molecular phylogeny and diversity. The three major constituents comprising the CCM in the majority of eukaryotes are described. These include: (i) likely plasma-and chloroplast-membrane inorganic carbon transporters; (ii) a suite of carbonic anhydrase enzymes in strategic locations; and usually (iii) a microcompartment in which most Rubisco aggregates (the chloroplast pyrenoid). The molecular diversity of known CCM components are set against the current green algal model for their probable operation. The review then focuses on the kinetic and cystallographic interactions of Rubisco, which permit pyrenoid formation and CCM function. Firstly, we consider observations that surface residues of the Rubisco small subunit directly condition Rubisco aggregation and pyrenoid formation. Secondly, we reanalyse the phylogenetic progression in green Rubisco kinetic properties, and suggest that Rubisco substrate selectivity (the specificity factor, Srel, and affinity for CO2, Kc) demonstrate a systematic relaxation, which directly relates to the origins and effectiveness of a CCM. Finally, we consider the implications of eukaryotic CCM regulation and minimum components needed for introduction into higher plants as a possible means to enhance crop productivity in the future.

AB Climate warming may induce shifts in soil microbial communities possibly altering the long-term carbon mineralization potential of soils. We assessed the response of the bacterial community in a forest soil to experimental soil warming (+4 degrees C) in the context of seasonal fluctuations. Three experimental plots were sampled in the fourth year of warming in summer and winter and compared to control plots by 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing. We sequenced 17 308 amplicons per sample and analysed operational taxonomic units at genetic distances of 0.03, 0.10 and 0.25, with respective Good's coverages of 0.900, 0.977 and 0.998. Diversity indices did not differ between summer, winter, control or warmed samples. Summer and winter samples differed in community structure at a genetic distance of 0.25, corresponding approximately to phylum level. This was mainly because of an increase of Actinobacteria in winter. Abundance patterns of dominant taxa (> 0.06% of all reads) were analysed individually and revealed, that seasonal shifts were coherent among related phylogenetic groups. Seasonal community dynamics were subtle compared to the dynamics of soil respiration. Despite a pronounced respiration response to soil warming, we did not detect warming effects on community structure or composition. Fine-scale shifts may have been concealed by the considerable spatial variation.

AB 1. Methods used to predict shifts in species ranges because of climate change commonly involve species distribution (niche) modelling using climatic variables, future values of which are predicted for the next several decades by general circulation models. However, species distributions also depend on factors other than climate, such as land cover, land use and soil type. Changes in some of these factors, such as soil type, occur over geologic time and are thus imperceptible over the timescale of these types of projections. Other factors, such as land use and land cover, are expected to change over shorter timescales, but reliable projections are not available. Some important predictor variables, therefore, must be treated as unchanging, or static, whether because of the properties of the variable or out of necessity. The question of how best to combine dynamic variables predicted by climate models with static variables is not trivial and has been dealt with differently in studies to date. Alternative methods include using the static variables as masks, including them as independent explanatory variables in the model, or excluding them altogether. 2. Using a set of simulated species, we tested various methods for combining static variables with future climate scenarios. Our results showed that including static variables in the model with the dynamic variables performed better or no worse than either masking or excluding the static variables. 3. The difference in predictive ability was most pronounced when there is an interaction between the static and dynamic variables. 4. For variables such as land use, our results indicate that if such variables affect species distributions, including them in the model is better than excluding them, even though this may mean making the unrealistic assumption that the variable will not change in the future. 5. These results demonstrate the importance of including static and dynamic non-climate variables in addition to climate variables in species distribution models designed to predict future change in a species' habitat or distribution as a result of climate change.

AB Despite growing knowledge of fire-environment linkages in the western USA, obtaining reliable estimates of relative wildfire likelihood remains a work in progress. The purpose of this study is to use updated fire observations during a 25-year period and a wide array of environmental variables in a statistical framework to produce high-resolution estimates of wildfire probability. Using the MaxEnt modelling technique, point-source fire observations that were sampled from area burned during the 1984-2008 time period were related to explanatory variables representing ignitions, flammable vegetation (i.e. fuels), climate and topography. Model results were used to produce spatially explicit predictions of wildfire probability. To assess the effect of humans on the spatial patterns of wildfire likelihood, we built an alternative model that excluded all variables having a strong anthropogenic imprint. Results showed that wildfire probability in the western USA is far from uniform, with different areas responding to different environmental drivers. The effect of anthropogenic factors on wildfire probability varied by region but, on the whole, humans appear to inhibit fire activity in the western USA. Our results not only provide what appear to be robust predictions of wildfire likelihood, but also enhance understanding of long-term controls on wildfire activity. In addition, our wildfire probability maps provide better information for strategic planning of land-management activities, especially where fire regime knowledge is sparse.

AB Background: One of the most significant consequences of contemporary global change is the rapid decline of biodiversity in many ecosystems. Knowledge of the consequences of biodiversity loss in terrestrial ecosystems is largely restricted to single ecosystem functions. Impacts of key plant functional groups on soil biota are considered to be more important than those of plant diversity; however, current knowledge mainly relies on short-term experiments.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: We studied changes in the impacts of plant diversity and presence of key functional groups on soil biota by investigating the performance of soil microorganisms and soil fauna two, four and six years after the establishment of model grasslands. The results indicate that temporal changes of plant community effects depend on the trophic affiliation of soil animals: plant diversity effects on decomposers only occurred after six years, changed little in herbivores, but occurred in predators after two years. The results suggest that plant diversity, in terms of species and functional group richness, is the most important plant community property affecting soil biota, exceeding the relevance of plant above-and belowground productivity and the presence of key plant functional groups, i.e. grasses and legumes, with the relevance of the latter decreasing in time.
   Conclusions/Significance: Plant diversity effects on biota are not only due to the presence of key plant functional groups or plant productivity highlighting the importance of diverse and high-quality plant derived resources, and supporting the validity of the singular hypothesis for soil biota. Our results demonstrate that in the long term plant diversity essentially drives the performance of soil biota questioning the paradigm that belowground communities are not affected by plant diversity and reinforcing the importance of biodiversity for ecosystem functioning.

AB Ecological thresholds that lead to alternative community states can be exceeded through gradual perturbation or as a result of sudden disturbance. Many Great Plains streams have experienced dramatic changes in their hydrologic regime resulting from water and landuse changes that began as early as 1880. These changes, combined with the presence of many invasive species, have substantially altered the fish communities in this area. We quantified temporal changes in fish communities in 3 large river basins in relation to putative anthropogenic stressors, including increased sediment supply derived from row-crop agriculture (beginning in 1880), habitat fragmentation caused by reservoir construction (beginning in the 1950s), and reduced discharge caused by groundwater withdrawal (beginning in the 1960s). We hypothesized that these abiotic regime shifts, coupled with species invasions, would shift the system from a fish community dominated by lotic (flowing water) species to one dominated by lentic (still water) species. Further, we predicted that the timing and intensity of community change would vary across basins that experienced different types and levels of stressors. Restructuring of fish communities across the 3 river basins was driven primarily by similar increases in lentic species, with only a few declines in several large-river species. Current fish communities in these basins share <50% of the species recorded in historic collections, and these differences were driven by species extirpations and invasions. The greatest levels of community divergence over time occurred in western Kansas basins that experienced the most intense groundwater withdrawals and fragmentation by reservoirs. An alarming result from this analysis was the recent (after 1991) expansion of several invasive species in the Arkansas and lower Kansas River basins and the decline or extirpation of several native species where flow regimes are less heavily altered. Accelerating changes in the biota and habitat identified by our retrospective analysis highlight potential complications for restoring the habitat and native fish communities to a previous state.

AB Gladden Spit, a salient reef promontory on the Belize Barrier Reef, is all important fishing ground for snappers and serves as a multi-species spawning aggregation site for several species of reef fish. Interviews with fishermen led to this study relating geomorphology and environmental conditions, especially currents, to transient fish aggregations and spawning. Based on multi-year observations, we describe direct evidence of spawning for 17 species of transient spawning reef fish from six families. Cubera snapper Lutjanus cyanopterus (Cuvier, 1828), mutton snapper Lutjanus analis (Cuvier, 1828), and dog snapper Lutjanus jocu (Bloch and Schneider, 1801) were most prominent in abundance, biomass, and egg production, although other large and commercially important species, including members of the grouper (Serranidae) and jack (Carangidae) families were also well represented. Spawning occurred throughout the year with species-specific patterns of spawning time (seasonality) and location (site fidelity). All spawning occurred above the shelf edge within a 6 ha area on the shelf just seaward of the reef promontory, in depths from 35 m to the surface. All spawning occurred between full moon and new moon, and all spawning took place near or after sunset with the exception of one species that spawned in the afternoon. Currents were faster and more variable at the spawning site compared to adjacent shelf edge areas. We hypothesize that steep relief and highly variable currents at Gladden Spit are important factors for adults of many fish species selecting the promontory for aggregation and spawning.

AB Squid are important components of many marine ecosystems from the poles to the equator, serving as both important predators and prey. Novel aspects of their growth and reproduction mean that they are likely to play an important role in the changing oceans due to climate change. Virtually every facet of squid life-history examined thus far has revealed an incredible capacity in this group for life-history plasticity. The extremely fast growth rates of individuals and rapid rates of turnover at the population level mean that squid can respond quickly to environmental or ecosystem change. Their 'life-in-the-fast-lane' lifestyle allows them to rapidly exploit 'vacuums' created in the ecosystem when predators or competitors are removed. In this way, they function as 'weeds of the sea'. Elevated temperatures accelerate the life-histories of squid, increasing their growth rates and shortening their life-spans. At first glance, it would be logical to suggest that rising water temperatures associated with climate change ( if food supply remains adequate) would be beneficial to inshore squid populations and fisheries-growth rates would increase, life spans would shorten and population turnover would accelerate. However, the response of inshore squid populations to climate change is likely to be extremely complex. The size of hatchlings emerging from the eggs becomes smaller as temperatures increase and hatchling size may have a critical influence on the size-at-age that may be achieved as adults and subsequently, population structure. The influence of higher temperatures on the egg and adult stages may thus be opposing forces on the life-history. The process of climate change will likely result in squids that hatch out smaller and earlier, undergo faster growth over shorter life-spans and mature younger and at a smaller size. Individual squid will require more food per unit body size, require more oxygen for faster metabolisms and have a reduced capacity to cope without food. It is therefore likely that biological, physiological and behavioural changes in squid due to climate change will have far reaching effects.

AB In many areas of the northern Mediterranean Basin the abundance of forest and scrubland vegetation is increasing, commensurate with decreases in agricultural land use(s). Much of the land use/cover change (LUCC) in this region is associated with the marginalization of traditional agricultural practices due to ongoing socioeconomic shifts and subsequent ecological change. Regression-based models of LUCC have two purposes: (i) to aid explanation of the processes driving change and/or (ii) spatial projection of the changes themselves. The independent variables contained in the single 'best' regression model (that is, that which minimizes variation in the dependent variable) cannot be inferred as providing the strongest causal relationship with the dependent variable. Here, we examine the utility of hierarchical partitioning and multinomial regression models for, respectively, explanation and prediction of LUCC in EU Special Protection Area 56, 'Encinares del rio Alberche y Cofio' (SPA 56) near Madrid, Spain. Hierarchical partitioning estimates the contribution of regression model variables, both independently and in conjunction with other variables in a model, to the total variance explained by that model and is a tool to isolate important causal variables. By using hierarchical partitioning we find that the combined effects of factors driving land cover transitions varies with land cover classification, with a coarser classification reducing explained variance in LUCC. We use multinomial logistic regression models solely for projecting change, finding that accuracies of maps produced vary by land cover classification and are influenced by differing spatial resolutions of socioeconomic and biophysical data. When examining LUCC in human-dominated landscapes such as those of the Mediterranean Basin, the availability and analysis of spatial data at scales that match causal processes is vital to the performance of the statistical modelling techniques used here.

AB We evaluate the use of artificial neural networks, particularly the feedforward multilayer perceptron with back-propagation for training (MLP), in ecological modelling and make suggestions on its use. in MLP modelling, there are no assumptions about the underlying form of the data that must be met as in standard statistical techniques. Instead, researchers must clarify the process of modelling, as this is most critical to how the model performs and is interpreted. Overfitting on the data, a potential problem, can be avoided by limiting the complexity of the model and by using techniques such as weight decay, training with noise, and limiting the training of the network. Methods on when to stop training include: (1) early stopping based on cross-validation, (2) stopping after a analyst defined error is reached or after the error levels off, and (3) use of a test data set. The third method is not ideal as the test data set is then not independent of model development and the resulting model may have little generalizability. The importance of an independent data set cannot be overemphasized as we found dramatic differences in model accuracy assessed with prediction accuracy on the training data set, as estimated with bootstrapping, and from use of an independent data set. The comparison of the artificial neural network with a general linear model (GLM) as a standard procedure is recommended because a GLM may perform as well or better than the MLP. In such cases, there are no interactions or non-linear terms that need to be modelled and it will save time to use the GLM. Techniques such as sensitivity analyses, input variable relevances, neural interpretation diagrams, randomization tests, and partial derivatives should be used to make MLP models more transparent, and further our ecological understanding, an important goal of the modelling process. Based on our experience we discuss how to build an MLP model and how to optimize the parameters and architecture. The process should be explained explicitly to make the MLP models more readily accepted by the ecological research community at large, as well as to make it possible to replicate the research.

ID HABITAT FRAGMENTATION; REMNANTS
AB This paper is a brief overview of some of the key issues which have emerged from the preceding set of papers on ecological thresholds. These include:
   Whether threshold relationships are common and widespread.
   The potential for large variations in the use and application of the threshold concept to lead to adverse conservation outcomes, particularly when overly simplistic levels of vegetation cover are specified by policy makers and land managers.
   The inherent multi-variate nature of landscape processes and responses of individual species and assemblages that creates variability in datasets. This may lead to a limited ability to make accurate predictions from threshold relationships, even when those relationships are highly statistically significant.
   We believe that although the threshold concept is an appealing one and there is some empirical evidence to support it in some landscapes, it is not free of problems and a concerted research effort on the topic is needed. This is particularly important if it is to have value for robustly underpinning applied landscape management practices without unintentionally having negative impacts on rates of species loss or the loss of particular species.

AB We examined the effects of habitat discontinuities on gene flow among puma (Puma concolor) populations across the southwestern USA. Using 16 microsatellite loci, we genotyped 540 pumas sampled throughout the states of Utah, Colorado, Arizona, and New Mexico, where a high degree of habitat heterogeneity provides for a wide range of connective habitat configurations between subpopulations. We investigated genetic structuring using complementary individual- and population-based analyses, the latter employing a novel technique to geographically cluster individuals without introducing investigator bias. The analyses revealed genetic structuring at two distinct scales. First, strikingly strong differentiation between northern and southern regions within the study area suggests little migration between them. Second, within each region, gene flow appears to be strongly limited by distance, particularly in the presence of habitat barriers such as open desert and grasslands. Northern pumas showed both reduced genetic diversity and greater divergence from a hypothetical ancestral population based on Bayesian clustering analyses, possibly reflecting a post-Pleistocene range expansion. Bayesian clustering results were sensitive to sampling density, which may complicate inference of numbers of populations when using this method. The results presented here build on those of previous studies, and begin to complete a picture of how different habitat types facilitate or impede gene flow among puma populations.

AB We tested the role of benthic infaunal functional diversity in regulating the biogeochemistry of nearshore sediments using laboratory microcosms. Single and multispecies assemblages of deposit-feeding polychaetes (Clymenella torquata, Spio setosa, and Leitoscoloplos fragilis) were used, and fluxes of oxygen and phosphate, as well as profiles of oxygen and pH in the sediment pore water, were measured. Significant differences in flux rates were found among treatments that were unrelated to polychaete abundance or biomass alone. Multispecies assemblages had lower flux rates of both oxygen and phosphate than rates calculated from the single-species treatments. Depth-integrated oxygen and pH profiles also showed significant differences between multispecies assemblages and selected single-species treatments. These differences were most likely from species-specific feeding and burrowing behavior and species-related interactions. Coefficients of variance for both oxygen and pH were highest for microcosms with no polychaetes and lowest for the assemblages, indicating a dampening effect of multispecies assemblages on pore-water heterogeneity. When oxygen flux data was incorporated into a model of oxygen dynamics in Long Island Sound, results indicated that shifts in the benthic community composition could change sediment oxygen consumption rates sufficiently to disrupt the balance between the physical supply of oxygenated water and biological oxygen demand. The results of this study confirm the importance of benthic functional biodiversity to nearshore sedimentary processes and suggest that losses of functional diversity can have significant effects on ecosystem function.

AB Analysis of the genetic structure of the Norway lobster (Nephrops norvegicus), a marine crustacean with high commercial value, was undertaken to gain information regarding the differentiation of Atlantic from Mediterranean populations of marine invertebrates. Restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of two mitochondrial DNA segments, 3.6 kilobases in total, was performed. Twelve populations from the North Sea, Irish Sea, Portuguese coast and Aegean Sea were analysed. Low levels of differentiation were found among them (F-ST = 0.018, P < 0.001) and there were no signs of an Atlantic-Mediterranean divide or of an isolation-by-distance scheme of differentiation. Possible reasons for these low levels of differentiation can be found in the recent expansion of N. norvegicus populations. This is supported by the mismatch distribution of pairwise haplotype differences, as well as by the high mean haplotype diversity (h = 0.93) combined with medium nucleotide diversity (pi = 0.0057) (in comparison to values for marine crustaceans or teleosts) found in this study. This combination of high levels of haplotype diversity with moderate to low levels of nucleotide diversity has also been frequently attributed to a recent time of divergence for various marine species. No evidence was found for a Mediterranean refugium during glaciation periods, separate from the Atlantic, as has been reported for some marine species. The Irish Sea population was the most differentiated as a result of reduced levels of diversity. Results are also discussed in the light of future management of N. norvegicus stocks.

AB For nearly all species in the three genera of tribe Sinningieae (Gesneriaceae), Sinningia, Paliavana, and Vanhouttea (mostly in southeastern Brazil) plus 10 outgroups, we have sequenced six non-coding DNA regions (i.e., plastid intergenic spacers trnT-trnL, trnL-trnF, trnS-trnG, atpB-rbcL, and introns in the trnL and rpl16 genes) and four introns in nuclear plastid-expressed glutamine synthetase gene (ncpGS). Separate and combined analyses of these data sets using maximum parsimony supported the monophyly of Sinningieae, but the genera Paliavana and Vanhouttea were found embedded within Sinningia; therefore a new infrageneric classification is here proposed. Mapping of pollination syndromes on the DNA-based trees supported multiple origins of hummingbird and bee syndromes and derivation of moth and bat syndromes from hummingbird flowers. Perennial tubers were derived from perennial stems in non-tuberous plants.

AB Specificity of plant induction responses may be important to the interactions between mustards and insect herbivores. This study compared the effects of the cabbage white butterfly, Pieris rapae (L.), cabbage looper, Trichoplusia ni (Hubner), and the mustard flea beetle, Phyllotreta cruciferae (Goeze) on induction of leaf trichome density, sinigrin concentration, and nitrogen concentration in black mustard, Brassica nigra (L.) Koch. Plants were damaged for 12 h at the four-leaf stage, with effort made to standardize the damage applied. Induction responses were measured on the fifth, seventh, ninth, and 11th leaves counted from the cotyledons. Seventh leaves of plants damaged by P rapae had 76% more trichomes per unit area than controls, whereas equivalent leaves of plants damaged by the other two herbivores exhibited no response. Ninth leaves of plants damaged by T ni had 113% more trichomes per unit area than controls, whereas equivalent leaves of plants damaged by the other two herbivores exhibited no response. Trichome densities of fifth and 11th leaves did not respond to treatments. Leaf sinigrin and nitrogen concentrations were not affected by the damage treatments. Differential plant trichome response to R rapae and T ni may have been due to differences in location of feeding during the damage treatment. Other cues, such as salivary components, may also have differed between the two herbivores. This study is one of the first to document differential effects of two herbivores from the same guild on induction of morphological resistance.

AB The objectives of this paper were to review the literature on the responses of root systems to elevated CO2 in intact, native grassland ecosystems, and to present the results from a 2-yr study of root production and mortality in an intact calcareous grassland in Switzerland. Previous work in intact native grassland systems has revealed that significant stimulation of the size of root systems (biomass, length density or root number) is not a universal response to elevated CO2. Of the 12 studies reviewed, seven showed little or no change in root-system size under elevated CO2, while five showed marked increases (average increase 38%). Insufficient data are available on the effects of elevated CO2 on root production, mortality and life span to allow generalization about effects. The diversity of experimental techniques employed in these native grassland studies also makes generalization difficult. In the present study, root production and mortality were monitored rn situ in a species-rich calcareous grassland community using minirhizotrons in order to test the hypothesis that an increase in these two measures would help explain the increase in net ecosystem CO2 uptake (net ecosystem exchange) previously observed under elevated CO2 at this site (600 vs 350 mu l CO2 l(-1); eight 1.2-m(2) experimental plots per CO2 level using the screen-aided CO2 control method). However, results from the first 2 yr showed no difference in overall root production or mortality in the top 18 cm of soil, where 80-90% of the roots occur. Elevated CO2 was associated with an upward shift in root length density: under elevated CO2 a greater proportion of roots were found in the upper 0-6-cm soil layer, and a lower proportion of roots in the lower 12-18 cm, than under ambient CO2. Elevated CO2 was also associated with an increase in root survival probability (RSP; e.g. for roots still alive 280 d after they were produced under ambient CO2, RSP = 0.30; elevated CO2, RSP = 0.56) and an increase (48% ) in median root life span in the deepest (12-18 cm) soil layer. The factors driving changes in root distribution and longevity with depth under elevated CO2 were not clear, but might have been related to increases in soil moisture under elevated CO2 interacting with vertical patterns in soil temperatures. Thus extra CO2 taken up in this grassland ecosystem during the growing season under elevated CO2 could not be explained by changes in root production and mortality. However, C and nutrient cycling might be shifted closer to the soil surface, which could potentially have a substantial effect on the activities of soil heterotrophic organisms as CO2 levels rise.

AB To study the effects of elevated CO2 on gas exchange, nonstructural carbohydrate and nutrient concentrations in current-year folia,ae of 30-year-old Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) trees, branches were enclosed in ventilated, transparent plastic bags and flushed with ambient air (mean 370 mu mol CO2 mol(-1); control) or ambient air + 340 mu mol CO2 mol(-1) (elevated CO2) during two growing seasons. One branch bag was installed on each of 24 selected trees From control and fertilized plots. To reduce the effect of variation among trees, results from each treated branch were compared with those from a control branch on the same whorl of the same tree. Elevated CO2 increased rates of light-saturated photosynthesis on average by 55% when measured at the treatment CO2 concentration. The increase was larger in shoots with high needle nitrogen concentrations than in shoots with low needle nitrogen concentrations. However, shoots grown in elevated CO2 showed a decrease in photosynthetic capacity compared with shoots grown in ambient CO2. When measured at the internal CO2 concentration of 200 mu mol CO2 mol(-1), photosynthetic rates of branches in the elevated CO2 treatments were reduced by 8 to 32%. The elevated CO2 treatment caused a 9 to 20% reduction in carboxylation efficiency and an 18% increase in respiration rates. In response to elevated CO2, starch, fructose and glucose concentrations in the needles increased on average 33%, whereas concentrations of potassium, nitrogen, phosphorus, magnesium and boron decreased. Needle nitrogen concentrations explained 50-60% of the variation in photosynthesis and CO2 acclimation was greater at low nitrogen concentrations than at high nitrogen concentrations. We conclude that the enhanced photosynthetic rates found in shoots exposed to elevated CO2 increased carbohydrate concentrations, which may have a negative feedback on the photosynthetic apparatus and stimulate cyanide-resistant respiration. We also infer that the decrease in nutrient concentrations of needles exposed to elevated CO2 was the result of retranslocation of nutrients to other parts of the branch or tree.

AB This article reviews the current research and applications of various digital soil mapping (DSM) techniques used to map Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) concentration and stocks following a systematic mapping approach from 2013 until present (18 February 2019). It is intended that this review of relevant literature will assist prospective researchers by identifying knowledge clusters and gaps in relation to the digital mapping of SOC. Of 120 studies, most were clustered in some specific countries such as China, Australia and the USA. The highest number publications were in 2016 and 2017. Regarding the predictive models, there was a progression from Linear Models towards Machine Learning (ML) techniques, and hybrid models in Regression Kriging (RK) framework performed better than individual models. Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) was the most frequently used method for predicting SOC, although it was outperformed by other ML techniques in most studies. Random Forest (RF) was found to perform better than MLR and other ML techniques in most comparative studies. Other common and competitive techniques were Cubist, Neural Network (NN), Boosted Regression Tree (BRT), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR). Due to the inconsistency in various comparative studies, it would be advisable to calibrate the competitive algorithms using specific experimental datasets. This review also reveals the environmental covariates that have been identified as the most important by RF technique in recent years in regard to digital mapping of SOC, which may assist in selecting optimum sets of environmental covariates for mapping SOC. Covariates representing organism/organic activities were among the most frequent among top five covariates, followed by the variables representing climate and topography. Climate was reported to be influential in determining the variation in SOC level at regional scales, followed by parent materials, topography and land use. However, for mapping at a resolution that represents smaller areas such as a farm- or plot-scale, land use and vegetation indices were stated to be more influential in predicting SOC. Furthermore, unlike a previous review work, all recent studies in this review incorporated validation and 41% of them estimated spatially explicit prediction of uncertainty. Only 9.16% studies performed external validation, whereas most studies used data-splitting and cross-validation techniques which may not be the best options for datasets obtained through non-probability sampling.

AB Nature-based solutions (NBS) in river landscapes, such as restoring floodplains, can not only decrease flood risks for downstream communities but also provide co-benefits in terms of habitat creation for numerous species and enhanced delivery of diverse ecosystem services. This paper aims to explore how landscape planning and governance research can contribute to the identification, design and implementation of NBS, using the example of water-related challenges in the landscape of the Lahn river in Germany. The objectives are (i) to introduce the NBS concept and to provide a concise definition for application in planning research, (ii) to explore how landscape planning and governance research might support a targeted use and implementation of NBS, and (iii) to propose an agenda for further research and practical experimentation. Our methods include a focused literature review and conceptual framework development. We define NBS as actions that alleviate a well-defined societal challenge (challenge-orientation), employ ecosystem processes of spatial, blue and green infrastructure networks (ecosystem processes utilization), and are embedded within viable governance or business models for implementation (practical viability). Our conceptual framework illustrates the functions of NBS in social-ecological landscape systems, and highlights the complementary contributions of landscape planning and governance research in developing and implementing NBS. Finally, a research and experimentation agenda is proposed, focusing on knowledge gaps in the effectiveness of NBS, useful approaches for informed co-design of NBS, and options for implementation. Insights from this paper can guide further studies and support testing of the NBS concept in practice.

AB "Conservation genomics" encompasses the idea that genome-scale data will improve the capacity of resource managers to protect species. Although genetic approaches have long been used in conservation research, it has only recently become tractable to generate genome-wide data at a scale that is useful for conservation. In this Review, we discuss how genome-scale data can inform species delineation in the face of admixture, facilitate evolution through the identification of adaptive alleles, and enhance evolutionary rescue based on genomic patterns of inbreeding. As genomic approaches become more widely adopted in conservation, we expect that they will have a positive impact on management and policy decisions.

AB Aim (1) To characterize the relationship(s) between species richness and area for alien plant and bird species on islands, and to identify commonalities and differences in those relationships for these different taxa, and between alien and native species; (2) to test whether area per se, native species richness or human factors related to area is the primary determinant of alien species richness; and (3) to explore the effects on alien island biogeography of isolation, productivity and the time since first European landfall.
   Location Islands around the world.
   Methods We used structural equation models (SEMs; supported by generalized linear models) to interrogate data on the alien and native species richness of birds and plants on islands.
   Results Alien plant and bird species richness were both strongly correlated with island area, with similar slopes on logarithmic axes. SEMs for both plants and birds revealed positive direct effects of native species richness and human population size, and positive indirect effects of area, on alien species richness. The models also identified indirect effects of temperature (positive) and isolation (negative) on alien species richness. Native plant and bird species richness were both predicted by direct effects of area (positive), temperature (positive) and isolation (negative). However, native plant richness was the only direct predictor of native bird species richness, and the strongest direct predictor of alien bird species richness, for islands with both plant and bird richness data.
   Main conclusions Our analyses recover the species-area, species-isolation and productivity relationships in native richness. Alien species richness was most strongly related to native species richness, with additional effects of human population size. Human population size most likely determines the number of alien species that arrive on an island, while the effect of native species richness may be driven by the influence of habitat heterogeneity on the likelihood that those populations persist (establishment success).

AB Two scientific communities with broad interest in sustainable agriculture independently focus on multifunctional agriculture or ecosystem services. These communities have limited interaction and exchange, and each group faces research challenges according to independently operating paradigms. This paper presents a comparative review of published research in multifunctional agriculture and ecosystem services. The motivation for this work is to improve communication, integrate experimental approaches, and propose areas of consensus and dialog for the two communities. This extensive analysis of publication trends, ideologies, and approaches enables formulation of four main conclusions. First, the two communities are closely related through their use of the term "function." However, multifunctional agriculture considers functions as agricultural activity outputs and prefers farm-centred approaches, whereas ecosystem services considers ecosystem functions in the provision of services and prefers service-centred approaches. Second, research approaches to common questions in these two communities share some similarities, and there would be great value in integrating these approaches. Third, the two communities have potential for dialog regarding the bundle of ecosystem services and the spectrum of multifunctional agriculture, or regarding land sharing and land sparing. Fourth, we propose an integrated conceptual framework that distinguishes six groups of ecosystem services and disservices in the agricultural landscape, and combines the concepts of multifunctional agriculture and ecosystem services. This integrated framework improves applications of multifunctional agriculture and ecosystem services for operational use. Future research should examine if the framework can be readily adapted for modelling specific problems in agricultural management. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A comprehensive understanding of interlinked ecological-economic systems requires integration of different theoretical frameworks and assessment methods. This paper reviews the main definitions, classifications, and methodological approaches used to identify, assess, and value stocks of natural capital and flows of ecosystem services. A synthesis of the major developments in the field of ecosystem services assessment is provided and the main future challenges are outlined. The notion of value in relation to natural capital and ecosystem services is discussed exploring different economic and ecological approaches. We then propose a conceptual framework integrating environmental accounting and ecosystem services assessment to highlight three main possible windows of attention to be investigated when focusing on ecosystem services provision and exploitation: (1) sustained economic and environmental costs, (2) received benefits, and (3) generated impacts. Finally, we conclude that such an ecological-economic and systems perspective to ecosystem services assessment could play an important role in investigating the interplay between ecological and socio-economic systems, allowing a broader and more comprehensive understanding of the benefits gained from ecosystems and the costs due to their exploitation.

AB This paper draws on the Foucauldian notion of biopower to renarrate the development of conservation science in the US as a form of liberal biopolitical rule. With its emphasis on making nature live, conservation marks a shift away from a sovereign form of rule that emphasized subduing and controlling nature; today, nature is ruled not by the sword but by science. Through a discussion of key concepts in conservation biology-populations in crisis; evolution and its future orientation; extinction as death that is necessary for life; and diversity as purity-we illustrate the truth discourses, underlying logics, and calculative technologies by which distinctions within nonhuman life are made and made meaningful. We argue that conservation is biopolitical not just in that it moves from controlling individuals to statistically managing populations and species, but also in that it extends the racialized logic of abnormality in its core notions of biological diversity and purity. In the logics of conservation and race, life produces diversity, conceived as variety of biological kinds; within that diversity exist kinds that foster ongoing life, which should be maximized, and kinds that are threats, which should be let die in the name of life in general.

AB We provide the first comparative multispecies analysis of spatial genetic structure and diversity in the circumpolar Arctic using a common strategy for sampling and genetic analyses. We aimed to identify and explain potential general patterns of genetic discontinuity/connectivity and diversity, and to compare our findings with previously published hypotheses. We collected and analyzed 7707 samples of 17 widespread arctic-alpine plant species for amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs). Genetic structure, diversity and distinctiveness were analyzed for each species, and extrapolated to cover the geographic range of each species. The resulting maps were overlaid to produce metamaps. The Arctic and Atlantic Oceans, the Greenlandic ice cap, the Urals, and lowland areas between southern mountain ranges and the Arctic were the strongest barriers against gene flow. Diversity was highest in Beringia and gradually decreased into formerly glaciated areas. The highest degrees of distinctiveness were observed in Siberia. We conclude that large-scale general patterns exist in the Arctic, shaped by the Pleistocene glaciations combined with long-standing physical barriers against gene flow. Beringia served as both refugium and source for interglacial (re)colonization, whereas areas further west in Siberia served as refugia, but less as sources for (re)colonization.

AB Making nature's value visible to humans is a key issue for the XXI century and it is crucial to identify and measure natural capital to incorporate benefits or costs of changes in ecosystem services into policy. Emergy analysis, a method able to analyze the overall functioning of a system, was applied to reckon the value of main ecosystem services provided by Posidonia oceanica, a fragile and precious Mediterranean seagrass ecosystem. Estimates, based on calculation of resources employed by nature, resulted in a value of 172 (sic) m(2) a(-1). Sediment retained by meadow is most relevant input, composing almost the whole P. oceanica value. Remarks about economic losses arising from meadow regression have been made through a time-comparison of meadow maps. Suggested procedure represents an operative tool to provide a synthetic monetary measure of ecosystem services to be employed when comparing natural capital to human and financial capitals in a substitutability perspective.

AB Aim Geographical variation in numbers of established non-native species provides clues to the underlying processes driving biological invasions. Specifically, this variation reflects landscape characteristics that drive non-native species arrival, establishment and spread. Here, we investigate spatial variation in damaging non-native forest insect and pathogen species to draw inferences about the dominant processes influencing their arrival, establishment and spread.
   Location The continental USA, including Alaska (Hawaii not included).
   Methods We assembled the current geographical ranges (county-level) of 79 species of damaging non-indigenous forest insect and pathogen species currently established in the continental USA. We explored statistical associations of numbers of species per county with habitat characteristics associated with propagule pressure and with variables reflecting habitat invasibility. We also analysed relationships between the geographical area occupied by each pest species and the time since introduction and habitat characteristics.
   Results The geographical pattern of non-native forest pest species richness is highly focused, with vastly more species in the north-eastern USA. Geographical variation in species richness is associated with habitat factors related to both propagule pressure and invasibility. Ranges of the non-native species are related to historical spread; range areas are strongly correlated with time since establishment. The average (all species) radial rate of range expansion is 5.2 km yr(-1), and surprisingly, this rate did not differ among foliage feeders, sap-feeders, wood borers and plant pathogens.
   Main conclusions Forest pest species are much more concentrated in the north-eastern region of the USA compared with other parts of the country. This pattern most likely reflects the combined effects of propagule pressure (pest arrival), habitat invasibility (pest establishment) and invasion spread. The similarity in historical spread among different types of organisms indicates the importance of anthropogenic movement in spread.

AB 1. Many characteristics of the salt marsh environment covary with elevation. It has therefore proved difficult to determine which environmental characteristics limit the distributions of particular species in the field. Oxygen supply to the rhizosphere may be particularly important, as it is determined by the duration and frequency of flooding.
   2. The re-activation of a salt marsh by managed coastal realignment provided an opportunity to investigate the large-scale manipulation of environmental effects on halophyte distribution in a situation where the usual relationships between environmental characteristics, elevation and succession had been partially uncoupled.
   3. Most locations sampled lay between mean neap and mean spring tidal levels. As expected, anoxic conditions occurred at lower elevation, redox potential increased generally with elevation and sediments were oxic on the upper parts. However, sediment oxygenation at any given elevation was variable, particularly at intermediate levels in the tidal range. This imperfect correlation between elevation and sediment redox allowed quantification of their independent effects on species distributions using the statistical technique of Hierarchical Partitioning.
   4. Effects of elevation and sediment redox potential were distinguishable from each other. Salicornia europaea occurred predominantly at lower elevation but was not influenced by redox potential. Puccinellia maritima favoured low redox potentials independently of elevation. In contrast, Suaeda maritima tolerated a wide range of elevations but was absent from areas with low redox potential. Atriplex portulacoides was apparently more averse to low redox potential than to low elevation. Elytrigia atherica was restricted to both high redox potential and high elevation. Smaller independent effects of sediment depth, salinity, water content, nitrate concentration, shear strength and loss on ignition were apparent for some species.
   5. Synthesis. Although much of the elevational zonation of species on salt marshes is mediated by differential tolerance of the consequences of co-linearly varying variables, particularly sediment anoxia and elevation, these variables have independent effects that are quantifiable in the field. Hierarchical Partitioning provides a valuable tool for distinguishing the mechanisms underlying species zonations on environmental gradients, especially where large-scale environmental manipulations have partially decoupled the usual co-linear variation.

AB The Nile crocodile (Crocodylus niloticus) is an ancient icon of both cultural and scientific interest. The species is emblematic of the great civilizations of the Nile River valley and serves as a model for international wildlife conservation. Despite its familiarity, a centuries-long dispute over the taxonomic status of the Nile crocodile remains unresolved. This dispute not only confounds our understanding of the origins and biogeography of the 'true crocodiles' of the crown genus Crocodylus, but also complicates conservation and management of this commercially valuable species. We have taken a total evidence approach involving phylogenetic analysis of mitochondrial and nuclear markers, as well as karyotype analysis of chromosome number and structure, to assess the monophyletic status of the Nile crocodile. Samples were collected from throughout Africa, covering all major bioregions. We also utilized specimens from museum collections, including mummified crocodiles from the ancient Egyptian temples at Thebes and the Grottes de Samoun, to reconstruct the genetic profiles of extirpated populations. Our analyses reveal a cryptic evolutionary lineage within the Nile crocodile that elucidates the biogeographic history of the genus and clarifies long-standing arguments over the species' taxonomic identity and conservation status. An examination of crocodile mummy haplotypes indicates that the cryptic lineage corresponds to an earlier description of C. suchus and suggests that both African Crocodylus lineages historically inhabited the Nile River. Recent survey efforts indicate that C. suchus is declining or extirpated throughout much of its distribution. Without proper recognition of this cryptic species, current sustainable use-based management policies for the Nile crocodile may do more harm than good.

AB The increasing interest in the effects of climate changes on species distributions has been followed by the development of Species Distribution Models (SDMs). Although these techniques are starting to be used to study the location and dynamics of past species distributions, a sound theoretical framework for their use in paleoecology is still lacking. In this paper we are reviewing the main challenges for constructing Paleo-Species Distribution Models to describe and project the past distribution of species, namely data limitations, selection of predictors and choice of a biologically-relevant modeling procedure. We also review and discuss the current state-of-the-art in Paleo-SDMs, providing a series of recommendations for their use, and proposing future research lines to improve the use of these techniques in paleobiogeography.

AB Variation in organic matter inputs caused by differences in plant community composition has been shown to affect microbial activity, although the mechanisms controlling these effects are not entirely understood. In this study we determine the effects of variation in substrate composition, quantity, and diversity on soil extracellular enzyme activity and respiration in laboratory microcosms. Microbial respiration responded predictably to substrate composition and quantity and was maximized by the addition of labile substrates and greater substrate quantity. However, there was no effect of substrate diversity on respiration. Substrate composition significantly affected enzyme activity. Phosphatase activity was maximized with addition of C and N together, supporting the common notion that addition of limiting resources increases investment in enzymes to acquire other limiting nutrients. Chitinase activity was maximized with the addition of chitin, suggesting that some enzymes may be stimulated by the addition of the substrate they degrade. In contrast, activities of glucosidase and peptidase were maximized by the addition of the products of these enzymes, glucose and alanine, respectively, for reasons that are unclear. Substrate diversity and quantity also stimulated enzyme activity for three and four of the six enzymes assayed, respectively. We found evidence of complementary (i.e., non-additive) effects of additions of different substrates on activity for three of the six enzymes assayed; for the remaining enzymes, effects of adding a greater diversity of substrates appeared to arise from the substrate-specific effects of those substrates included in the high-diversity treatment. Finally, in a comparison of measures of microbial respiration and enzyme activity, we found that labile C and nutrient-acquiring enzymes, not those involved in the degradation of recalcitrant compounds, were the best predictors of respiration rates. These results suggest that while composition, quantity, and diversity of inputs to microbial communities all affect microbial enzyme activity, the mechanisms controlling these relationships are unique for each particular enzyme.

AB How extraordinary numbers of species can coexist in hyper-diverse communities remains unresolved. While numerous hypotheses have been proposed based on observational and theoretical investigations, little is known about which mechanisms are truly active in forest communities and less is known about their relative contributions to community assembly. In this study, generalized linear mixed models with crossed random effects were used to assess the relative contributions of density dependence and habitat association to community-level diversity maintenance. Species habitat associations were classified based on soil nutrients, topography and species composition. Local neighbourhood effects were also addressed with spatially explicit models of seedling survival. The results shown here reveal that local- and community-level seedling dynamics were consistent with density-dependent predictions, although habitat association played a more important role in shaping short-term seedling survival. We conclude that density dependence could promote species coexistence on the premise of habitat partitioning.

In this study, we address the question of the genetic consequences of Pleistocene glaciations for European grey wolves. Combining our data with data from published studies, we analysed phylogenetic relationships and geographic distribution of mitochondrial DNA haplotypes for 947 contemporary European wolves. We also compared the contemporary wolf sequences with published sequences of 24 ancient European wolves.
   Results: We found that haplotypes representing two haplogroups, 1 and 2, overlap geographically, but substantially differ in frequency between populations from south-western and eastern Europe. A comparison between haplotypes from Europe and other continents showed that both haplogroups are spread throughout Eurasia, while only haplogroup 1 occurs in contemporary North American wolves. All ancient wolf samples from western Europe that dated from between 44,000 and 1,200 years B.P. belonged to haplogroup 2, suggesting the long-term predominance of this haplogroup in this region. Moreover, a comparison of current and past frequencies and distributions of the two haplogroups in Europe suggested that haplogroup 2 became outnumbered by haplogroup 1 during the last several thousand years.
   Conclusions: Parallel haplogroup replacement, with haplogroup 2 being totally replaced by haplogroup 1, has been reported for North American grey wolves. Taking into account the similarity of diets reported for the late Pleistocene wolves from Europe and North America, the correspondence between these haplogroup frequency changes may suggest that they were associated with ecological changes occurring after the Last Glacial Maximum.

AB Biodiversity is known to play a fundamental role in ecosystem functioning and thus may positively influence the provision of ecosystem services with benefits to society. There is a need for further understanding of how specific components of biodiversity are affecting service provision. In this context, terrestrial plants are a particularly important component of biodiversity and one for which a wealth of information on biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships is available. In this paper, we consider terrestrial plants as providers of ecosystem services and analyze whether manipulating plant diversity has an effect on the magnitude of ecosystem service provision using a meta-analysis of 197 effect sizes and a vote-counting analysis of 361 significance tests. The results of these analyses are compared with those of a previous meta-analysis that included a wide diversity of service providers. We produce a synthesis table to explicitly link plants as service providers to indicators of ecosystem properties and these to ecosystem services. By focusing on only plants, we found a clear positive effect of biodiversity on six out of eight services analyzed (provisioning of plant products, erosion control, invasion resistance, pest regulation, pathogen regulation and soil fertility regulation). When controlling for pseudoreplication (repeated records from single studies), we found that four of the six positive effects remained significant; only pest regulation and soil fertility showed non-significant effects. Further expanding our basis for inference with the vote-counting analysis corroborated these results, demonstrating that quantitative meta-analysis and vote-counting methods are both useful methods to synthesize biodiversity ecosystem service studies. Notwithstanding the restricted number of identified services, our results point to the importance of maintaining plant diversity to ensure and increased provision of ecosystem services which benefit human well-being.

AB P> Nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) are essential nutrients for photosynthetic carbon assimilation and most frequently limit primary productivity in terrestrial ecosystems. Efficient use of those nutrients is important for plants growing in nutrient-poor environments.
   We investigated the pattern of photosynthetic phosphorus-use efficiency (PPUE) in comparison with photosynthetic nitrogen-use efficiency (PNUE) along gradients of P and N availability across biomes with 340 tree and shrub species. We used both total soil N and P concentration and foliar N/P ratios for indicating nutrient-availability gradients.
   Photosynthetic phosphorus-use efficiency increased with greater leaf mass per area (LMA) toward decreasing P availability. By contrast, PNUE decreased with greater LMA towards decreasing N and P availability.
   The increase in PPUE with decreasing P availability was caused by the net effects of a relatively greater reduction in foliar P concentration and a relatively constant photosynthetic carbon assimilation rate. The decrease in PNUE with decreasing N availability was caused by the effects of a reduction in photosynthetic carbon assimilation rate with greater LMA.
   Synthesis. Our results suggest that higher PPUE may be an effective leaf-level adaptation to P-poor soils, especially in tropical tree species. Future research should focus on the difference between PPUE and PNUE in relation to leaf economics, physiology and strategy.

AB Habitat loss and fragmentation are serious threats to biodiversity, especially in the Amazon Basin, where biodiversity is greatest and deforestation is continuing at an alarming rate. Nonetheless, little is known about the responses of biotas to spatially explicit aspects of landscape structure.
   Bats are a promising indicator group for studying consequences of forest fragmentation in the Neotropics. Therefore, population- and assemblage-level responses of bats to landscape composition and configuration were quantified at each of three focal scales (circles of 1-, 3-, and 5-km radii) at 14 sites in lowland Amazonia.
   Responses to landscape characteristics were scale-dependent. Abundance and richness were higher in moderately fragmented forest than in continuous forest. Moreover, the abundance of each of nine frugivorous species decreased with increasing forest cover.
   The abundance of frugivores probably responded to landscape composition (e.g. percentage forest, mean patch density) because of an increase in early successional fruits and flowers in areas with reduced canopy cover. In contrast, abundances of gleaning animalivores responded to landscape configuration (e.g. edge density), probably by exploiting low-contrast edges (i.e. closed canopy forest patches embedded in secondary forest) while foraging and travelling between higher quality resource patches.
   Synthesis and applications. Species- and ensemble-specific responses to aspects of landscape structure suggest that both compositional and configurational aspects need to be managed effectively in conservation planning. However, conservation decisions based on associations of biodiversity metrics (e.g. richness, diversity and rarity) with landscape structure may be problematic as they are composite characteristics that mask individual responses and potentially reflect only patterns of the dominant species or groups.

AB Theories on the evolution and maintenance of sex are challenged by the existence of ancient parthenogenetic lineages such as bdelloid rotifers and darwinulid ostracods. It has been proposed that several parthenogenetic and speciose taxa of oribatid mites (Acari) also have an ancient origin. We used nucleotide sequences of the mitochondrial gene cytochrome oxidase I to estimate the age of the parthenogenetic oribatid mite species Platynothrus peltifer. Sixty-five specimens from 16 sites in North America, Europe and Asia were analysed. Seven major clades were identified. Within-clade genetic distances were below 2 % similar to the total intraspecific genetic diversity of most organisms. However, distances between clades averaged 56 % with a maximum of 125 %. We conclude that P. peltifer, as it is currently conceived, has existed for perhaps 100 million years, has an extant distribution that results from continental drift rather than dispersal and was subject to several cryptic speciations.

AB Predictive habitat models are an important tool for ecological research and conservation. A major cause of unreliable models is excessive model complexity, and regularization methods aim to improve the predictive performance by adequately constraining model complexity. We compare three regularization methods for logistic regression: variable selection, lasso, and ridge. They differ in the way model complexity is measured: variable selection uses the number of estimated parameters, the lasso uses the sum of the absolute values of the parameter estimates, and the ridge uses the sum of the squared values of the parameter estimates.
   We performed a simulation study with environmental data of a real landscape and artificial species occupancy data. We investigated the effect of three factors on relative model performance: (1) the number of parameters (16, 10, 6, 2) in the 'true' model that determined the distribution of the artificial species, (2) the prevalence, i.e. the proportion of sites occupied by the species, and (3) the sample size (measured in events per variable, EPV).
   Regularization improved model discrimination and calibration. However, no regularization method performed best under all circumstances: the ridge generally performed best in the 16-parameter scenario. The lasso generally performed best in the 10-parameter scenario. Variable selection with AIC was best at large sample sizes (EPV >= 10) when less than half of the variables influenced the species distribution. However, at low sample sizes (EPV < 10), ridge and lasso always performed best, regardless of the parameter scenario or prevalence. Overall, calibration was best in ridge models. Other methods showed overconfidence, particularly at low sample sizes. The percentage of correctly identified models was low for both lasso and variable selection.
   Variable selection should be used with caution. Although it can produce the best performing models under certain conditions, these situations are difficult to infer from the data. Ridge and lasso are risk-averse model strategies that can be expected to perform well under a wide range of underlying species-habitat relationships, particularly at small sample sizes.

AB Within a time-scale of several days photosynthesis can acclimate to light by variation in the capacity for photosynthesis with depth in a canopy or by variation in the stoichiometry of photosynthetic components at each position within the canopy. The changes in leaf photosynthetic capacity are usually related to and expressed as changes in leaf nitrogen content. However, photosynthetic capacity and leaf nitrogen never match exactly the photon flux density (PFD) gradient within a canopy. As a result, photosynthetic light use efficiency, i.e. photosynthetic performance per incident PFD, increases considerably from the top of the canopy to the lower shaded part. Many of existing optimisation models fail to express the actual pattern of nitrogen or photosynthetic capacity distribution within a canopy. This failure occurs because these optimisation models do not consider that the quantitative aspect of photosynthesis acclimation is a whole plant phenomenon. Although turnover models, which describe the distribution of the photosynthetic apparatus within a canopy as a dynamic equilibrium between breakdown and regeneration of apparatus with respect to nitrogen availability, photosynthetic rate and export of carbohydrates, produce realistic results, these models require confirmation. The mechanism responsible for changes in the relative share of light-harvesting apparatus as acclimation to irradiance remains unknown. Ability of the photosynthetic apparatus to balance properly the light harvesting capacity with electron transport and biochemical capacities is limited. As a result of this fundamental limitation, photosynthetic light use efficiency always increases with increasing thickness of the photosynthetic apparatus.

AB To test the hypothesis put forward by Feduccia of the origin of modern birds from transitional birds, we sequenced the first two complete mitochondrial genomes of shorebirds (ruddy turnstone and blackish oystercatcher) and compared their sequences with those of already published avian genomes. When corrected for rate heterogeneity across sites and non-homogeneous nucleotide compositions among lineages in maximum likelihood (NIL), the optimal tree places palaeognath birds as sister to the neognaths including shorebirds. This optimal topology is a re-rooting of recently published ordinal-level avian trees derived from mitochondrial sequences. Using a penalized likelihood (PL) rate-smoothing process in conjunction with dates estimated from fossils, we show that the basal splits in the bird tree are much older than the Cretaceous-Tertiary (K-T) boundary, reinforcing previous molecular studies that rejected the derivation of modem birds from transitional shorebirds. Our mean estimate for the origin of modern birds at about 123 million years ago (Myr ago) is quite close to recent estimates using both nuclear and mitochondrial genes, and supports theories of continental break-up as a driving force in avian diversification. Not only did many modem orders of birds originate well before the K-T boundary, but the radiation of major clades occurred over an extended period of at least 40 Myr ago, thus also falsifying Feduccia's rapid radiation scenario following a K-T bottleneck.

AB Human activities are simultaneously decreasing the size of wildlife populations (causing inbreeding) and increasing the level of stress that wildlife populations must face. Inbreeding reduces population fitness and increases extinction risk. However, very little information on the impact of stressful environments on extinction risk under inbreeding is available. We evaluated the impact of full sib inbreeding on extinction risk, using Drosophila melanogaster, in a benign and three stressful environments. The three stressful environments involved the addition to the medium of copper sulfate, methanol or alternating copper sulfate and methanol. There were 128 replicate populations for each of the four treatments. Under inbreeding, extinction rates were significantly higher in all three stressful environments compared with the benign environment. The percent extinct at generation eight (F = 0.826) for the four treatments were: 62.5% in the benign environment, 75.8% in the copper sulfate environment, 82.8% in the methanol environment, and 83.6% in the variable stress environment. However, the extinction rate in the variable stress environment did not differ significantly from the constant stress environments. Highly significant differences, among lineages, in extinction risk were detected. The results of this study indicate that wild populations are more vulnerable to inbreeding than indicated by extrapolation from captive environments.

AB Multilocus F-ST estimates revealed a pronounced genetic structure at six microsatellite loci in brown trout Salmo trutta in Nordre Finnvikelv, with at least three breeding units that remained stable over time. Significant differences in allele frequencies were found between five sections within a 3-km range, even when no physical barriers prevented fish from migrating between sections. It is argued that geological structures may rise to patterns resembling isolation by distance. Seemingly, the most important factor causing genetic differentiation in Nordre Finnvikelv is genetic drift in small populations that are geologically subdivided by a tributary and by impassable waterfalls. Some correlation between previous behavioural observations and genetic structures were found. (C) 1999 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles.

AB Studying the dispersal behaviour of small, volant, and nocturnal animals such as microchiropterans with direct methods (banding-recapture, telemetry) is a very difficult task. The development of easily scorable and highly variable genetic markers nowadays allows us to study some aspects of dispersal indirectly, using population genetics. Here, we applied these indirect methods to characterize male dispersal behaviour in a European bat species. The eight microsatellite loci analysed were highly variable in all the nursing colonies assessed (h = 0.63-0.93). Contrary to what we found in the mtDNA, an AMOVA and F-statistics showed that the overall European population structure of the noctule bat was very weak, indicating a high male dispersal rate. Nevertheless, the population was not totally panmictic (theta = 0.006, p < 0.001), and neither isolation by distance, nor influence of migration could account for this result. Rather, an analysis of pairwise theta-values showed that the population structure might be explained partly by a geographical barrier to gene flow (the Alps), and partly by the fact that there is some limit to the distance the males can disperse.

AB Despite considerable investigation, two main questions on the origin of Native Americans remain the topic of intense debate-namely, the number and time of the migration(s) into the Americas. Using the 720 available Amerindian mtDNA control-region sequences, we reanalyzed the nucleotide diversity found within each of the four major mtDNA haplogroups (A-D) thought to have been present in the colonization of the New World. We first verified whether the within-haplogroup sequence diversity could be used as a measure of the haplogroup's age. The pattern of shared polymorphism, the mismatch distribution, the phylogenetic trees, the value of Tajima's D, and the computer simulations all suggested that the four haplogroups underwent a bottleneck followed by a large population expansion. The four haplogroup diversities were very similar to each other, offering a strong support for their single origin. They suggested that the beginning of the Native Americans' ancestral-population differentiation occurred similar to 30,000-40,000 years before the present (ybp), with a 95%-cofidence-interval lower bound of similar to 25,000 ybp. These values are in good agreement with the New World-settlement model that we have presented elsewhere, extending the results initially found for haplogroup A to the three other major groups of mtDNA sequences found in the Americas. These results put the peopling of the Americas clearly in an early, pre-Clovis time frame.

AB Current projections indicate steady increases in both trophospheric ozone and carbon dioxide well into the next century with concurrent increases in plant stress. Because information about effects of these interacting stresses on forest trees is limited, we have conducted ozone and carbon dioxide experiments using ozone-tolerant and ozone-sensitive trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) clones (clones 216 and 259, respectively). Aspen plants were grown either in pots (square-wave study) or in the ground (episodic study) in open-top chambers. Plants in the square-wave study were exposed for a single growing season to charcoal-filtered air (CF) or to CF plus elevated carbon dioxide (CO2), ozone (O-3), or O-3 plus CO2 (O-3 + CO2). Plants in the episodic study were exposed for three growing seasons to CF, twice simulated ambient (2x) O-3 (2x O-3), or 2x O-3 plus CO2 (2x O-3 + CO2). Photosynthetic measurements were made either in the open-top chambers at treatment CO2 concentrations or in controlled-environment cuvettes with various CO2 concentrations, producing assimilation versus intercellular CO2 concentration (A/C-i) curves. Ozone decreased photosynthetic rate and stomatal conductance and accelerated leaf senescence. Elevated CO2 increased photosynthetic rate and decreased stomatal conductance when measured at treatment CO2 concentrations, and exacerbated the negative effect of O-3 on photosynthesis. For example, for clone 259, photosynthesis decreased 9% for the O-3 treatment compared with the CF treatment, but decreased 24% for the O-3 + CO2 treatment compared with the CO2 treatment. Similar decreases for clone 216 of 2% and 6% for O-3 and O-3 + CO2, respectively, were not significant. A/C-i curves showed that O-3 decreased carboxylation efficiency and maximum photosynthetic rate and that photosynthetic inhibition in response to O-3 was greater with elevated CO2. The simultaneous declines in all factors of photosynthetic gas exchange measurements suggest that the equilibrium between stomatal conductance, carboxylation, and light harvesting systems was not disrupted by O-3 and O-3 x CO2 interactions. Carbon dioxide did not ameliorate the detrimental effects of O-3 on the leaf photosynthetic apparatus. In fact, the O-3-tolerant clone appeared more sensitive to O-3 with elevated CO2.

AB (1) Geographic variation in maximum body size of male and female adders, Vipera berus, was documented over one mainland locality and six groups of islands in the Baltic Sea. Males varied more in body size among localities than females, although not significantly so.
   (2) Geographic variation in prey (field vole, Microtus agrestis) body size explained 68% and 40% of the variation in maximum body size of male and female adders, respectively. Body size of adders increased with body size of prey.
   (3) Adders were smaller on islands where there were three prey species than where there were two. It is suggested that selection for fasting endurance where there are few prey species and a high risk of starvation may have produced this pattern.
   (4) Growth rates of individual adders were faster where mean field vole body weight was large (47 g) than where it was small (26 g). Maximum body size of adders was large where growth rate was fast and vice versa.
   (5) Female adders were larger than males at all localities. Females also had faster growth rates than males.
   (6) The degree of sexual size dimorphism of adders varied among localities and was negatively correlated with size of males. There was no relationship between sexual dimorphism and size of females.
   (7) There was no significant relationship between sexual size dimorphism of adders and mean body size of field voles. Nor was there any relationship between sexual dimorphism and number of prey species or size distribution of field voles.
   (8) I argue that optimal body size for survival is locally determined by prey availability and size of prey items. However, due to the fecundity advantage of large size in females, female adders deviate from the optimum size for survival, and more so when this optimum size is small. Thus, local variation in properties of the food resource, e.g. prey size, can give rise to variation in sexual size dimorphism.

AB Plants are known to influence belowground microbial community structure along their roots, but the impacts of plant species richness and plant functional group (FG) identity on microbial communities in the bulk soil are still not well understood. Here, we used 454-pyrosequencing to analyse the soil microbial community composition in a long-term biodiversity experiment at Jena, Germany. We examined responses of bacteria, fungi, archaea, and protists to plant species richness (communities varying from 1 to 60 sown species) and plant FG identity (grasses, legumes, small herbs, tall herbs) in bulk soil. We hypothesized that plant species richness and FG identity would alter microbial community composition and have a positive impact on microbial species richness. Plant species richness had a marginal positive effect on the richness of fungi, but we observed no such effect on bacteria, archaea and protists. Plant species richness also did not have a large impact on microbial community composition. Rather, abiotic soil properties partially explained the community composition of bacteria, fungi, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), archaea and protists. Plant FG richness did not impact microbial community composition; however, plant FG identity was more effective. Bacterial richness was highest in legume plots and lowest in small herb plots, and AMF and archaeal community composition in legume plant communities was distinct from that in communities composed of other plant FGs. We conclude that soil microbial community composition in bulk soil is influenced more by changes in plant FG composition and abiotic soil properties, than by changes in plant species richness per se.

AB Evaluating the quality of ecosystems in terms of biological patrimony and functioning is of critical importance in the actual context of intensified human activities. Microbial diversity is commonly used as a bioindicator of ecosystems functioning. However, there is a lack of sensitivity of microbial diversity indicators in the case of moderate and chronic environmental degradation, such as atmospheric deposition of pollutants, agricultural practices, diffuse pollution by wastewater and climate change. As a consequence, there is a need for alternative bioindicators of soils and water quality. Here, we discuss the interest of adopting a more integrative approach based on biotic interaction networks beyond the simple diversity indicators. We review how the various biotic interactions can be integrated in the various microbial networks such as trophic, mutualistic and co-occurrence networks. Then we discuss the efficiency of microbial networks and associated metrics to detect changes in microbial communities. We conclude that the connectance, the number of links and the average degree of co-occurrence networks could vary from 10 to 50% in response to minor perturbations when microbial diversity parameters remain stable. Finally, we analyze studies that aimed at linking microbial networks and activity to evaluate the potential of such networks for providing simple and operational indicators of ecosystem quality and functioning.

AB A fundamental goal of ecological research is to understand and model how processes generate patterns so that if conditions change, changes in the patterns can be predicted. Different approaches have been proposed for modelling species assemblage, but their use to predict spatial patterns of species richness and other community attributes over a range of spatial and temporal scales remains challenging. Different methods emphasize different processes of structuring communities and different goals. In this review, we focus on models that were developed for generating spatially explicit predictions of communities, with a particular focus on species richness, composition, relative abundance and related attributes. We first briefly describe the concepts and theories that span the different drivers of species assembly. A combination of abiotic processes and biotic mechanisms are thought to influence the community assembly process. In this review, we describe four categories of drivers: (i) historical and evolutionary, (ii) environmental, (iii) biotic, and (iv) stochastic. We discuss the different modelling approaches proposed or applied at the community level and examine them from different standpoints, i.e. the theoretical bases, the drivers included, the source data, and the expected outputs, with special emphasis on conservation needs under climate change. We also highlight the most promising novelties, possible shortcomings, and potential extensions of existing methods. Finally, we present new approaches to model and predict species assemblages by reviewing promising 'integrative frameworks' and views that seek to incorporate all drivers of community assembly into a unique modelling workflow. We discuss the strengths and weaknesses of these new solutions and how they may hasten progress in community-level modelling.

AB Background: Although the common, silver, and bighead carps are native and sparsely distributed in Eurasia, these fish have become abundant and invasive in North America. An understanding of the biology of these species may provide insights into sustainable control methods. The animal-associated microbiome plays an important role in host health. Characterization of the carp microbiome and the factors that affect its composition is an important step toward understanding the biology and interrelationships between these species and their environments.
   Results: We compared the fecal microbiomes of common, silver, and bighead carps from wild and laboratory environments using Illumina sequencing of bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA). The fecal bacterial communities of fish were diverse, with Shannon indices ranging from 2.3 to 4.5. The phyla Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Fusobacteria dominated carp guts, comprising 76.7 % of total reads. Environment played a large role in shaping fecal microbial community composition, and microbiomes among captive fishes were more similar than among wild fishes. Although differences among wild fishes could be attributed to feeding preferences, diet did not strongly affect microbial community structure in laboratory-housed fishes. Comparison of wild- and lab-invasive carps revealed five shared OTUs that comprised approximately 40 % of the core fecal microbiome.
   Conclusions: The environment is a dominant factor shaping the fecal bacterial communities of invasive carps. Captivity alters the microbiome community structure relative to wild fish, while species differences are pronounced within habitats. Despite the absence of a true stomach, invasive carp species exhibited a core microbiota that warrants future study.

AB Global variation in total bark thickness (TBT) is traditionally attributed to fire. However, bark is multifunctional, as reflected by its inner living and outer dead regions, meaning that, in addition to fire protection, other factors probably contribute to TBT variation.
   To address how fire, climate, and plant size contribute to variation in TBT, inner bark thickness (IBT) and outer bark thickness (OBT), I sampled 640 species spanning all major angiosperm clades and 18 sites with contrasting precipitation, temperature, and fire regime.
   Stem size was by far the main driver of variation in thickness, with environment being less important. IBT was closely correlated with stem diameter, probably for metabolic reasons, and, controlling for size, was thicker in drier and hotter environments, even fire-free ones, probably reflecting its water and photosynthate storage role. OBT was less closely correlated with size, and was thicker in drier, seasonal sites experiencing frequent fires. IBT and OBT covaried loosely and both contributed to overall TBT variation. Thickness variation was higher within than across sites and was evolutionarily labile.
   Given high within-site diversity and the multiple selective factors acting on TBT, continued study of the different drivers of variation in bark thickness is crucial to understand bark ecology.

AB For landscape ecology to produce knowledge relevant to society, it must include considerations of human culture and behavior, extending beyond the natural sciences to synthesize with many other disciplines. Furthermore, it needs to be able to support landscape change processes which increasingly take the shape of deliberative and collaborative decision making by local stakeholder groups. Landscape ecology as described by Wu (Landscape Ecol 28:1-11, 2013) therefore needs three additional topics of investigation: (1) the local landscape as a boundary object that builds communication among disciplines and between science and local communities, (2) iterative and collaborative methods for generating transdisciplinary approaches to sustainable change, and (3) the effect of scientific knowledge and tools on local landscape policy and landscape change. Collectively, these topics could empower landscape ecology to be a science for action at the local scale.

AB 1. The drivers behind plant competition and diversity have long been debated, and there is acceptance that soil micro-organisms may act as key drivers in plant interactions and community structure. The evidence for a microbial role in shaping plant interactions and communities will be considered here with emphasis on symbionts and pathogens.
   2. Microbial populations are themselves strongly influenced by the plant community via the 'rhizosphere' effect. The rhizosphere community includes microbes both beneficial and detrimental to the plant. Both the ability of plants to cultivate different rhizosphere microbial populations and the resulting impact upon other plant species have largely been studied via 'plant-soil' feedback studies, a proxy necessitated by the fact the majority of soil microorganisms are unculturable, but which nevertheless has rarely been used in conjunction with modern techniques to identify and quantify the micro-organisms involved.
   3. Both microbial symbionts and pathogens can affect plant diversity and productivity, but the direct evidence for impacts on competitive interactions is surprisingly scarce. Evidence comes from biological invasions, the unintentional introduction of microbial pathogens to native plant communities and manipulative experiments under both field and controlled conditions. Pathogens generally have direct effects on plants, reducing their growth and so rendering them less competitive, whereas other symbionts may act by altering the availability of resources, with more subtle effects on competitive interactions.
   4. Some of the best evidence for indirect effects comes from studies on arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi. New developments in our understanding of nutrient exchange in the arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis emphasize the need to view the fungal partners not as mere extensions of the plant. The suggestion that AM fungi may act to share resources among connected plants however remains to be proved.
   5. Although plant competitive interactions can be driven by key microbial groups including symbionts and pathogens, knowledge gaps in the basic biology of these micro-organisms has hindered a full mechanistic understanding of these processes. If ecologists now embrace new technologies, significant advances in this area should be forthcoming.

AB Aim To analyse global patterns in soil carbon (C) in tropical successional and plantation forests based on climate, forest age, former land use and soil type to determine factors driving below-ground C storage. Location Pantropical. Methods We conducted a synthesis of 81 studies reporting soil C stocks in more than 400 reforested and tree plantation sites. We used regression models and regression tree analyses to determine the importance of multiple predictor variables on soil C stocks standardized to three common depth ranges: 010, 030 and 0100?cm. Results Mean annual temperature (MAT) was the most important predictor of soil C. Forest age explained little to no variability in soil C, in contrast with above-ground studies. Data on long-term trends in soil C are limited, as median time since forest growth was 15 years. Soil C stocks were similar between tropical secondary forests, tree plantations and reference forests. Differences between plantation and successional forests only appeared below 10?cm on sites with MAT < 21.3?degrees C. Former pastures and cultivated sites differed from each other only to depths of 30 or 100?cm. Climatic variables appeared multiple times across all layers of the regression trees, consistent with strong interactions between MAT and precipitation on soil C stocks. Main conclusions Climate explained greater variability in soil C in successional and plantation forests than former land use or forest age, despite the tropical location of all sites. Human management factors were more important for predicting soil C stocks in cooler and drier sites, while environmental variables were more important in hotter and wetter sites. The relative importance and interactions between soil type, previous land use and forest cover type differed with soil depth, highlighting the importance of comparing C across consistent depths. Climatic controls suggest sensitivity of soil C stocks in successional and plantation forests to future climate change.

AB Projecting future distributions of ecosystems or species climate niches has widely been used to assess the potential impacts of climate change. However, variability in such projections for the future periods, particularly the variability arising from uncertain future climates, remains a critical challenge for incorporating these projections into climate change adaptation strategies. We combined the use of a robust statistical modeling technique with a simple consensus approach consolidating projected outcomes for multiple climate change scenarios, and exemplify how the results could guide reforestation planning. Random Forest (RF) was used to model relationships between climate (1961-1990), described by 44 variables, and the geographic distribution of 16 major ecosystem types in British Columbia (BC), Canada. The model predicted current ecosystem distributions with high accuracy (mismatch rate = 4-16% for most ecosystem classes). It was then used to predict the distribution of ecosystem climate niches for the last decade (2001-2009) and project future distributions for 20 climate change scenarios. We found that geographic distributions of the suitable climate habitats for BC ecosystems have already shifted in 23% of BC since the 1970s. Consensus projections for future periods (2020s, 2050s, 2080s) indicated climates suitable for grasslands, dry forests, and moist continental cedar-hemlock forests would substantially expand; climate habitat for coastal rainforests would remain relatively stable; and habitat for boreal, subalpine and alpine ecosystems would decrease substantially. Using these consensus projections and data on the occurrence of Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii [Mirb.] Franco) in BC ecosystems, we estimated a twofold increase in seedling demand for this frost-sensitive, commercially important timber species, suggesting managers could begin planning to expand seed inventories and seed orchard capacity to more widely plant this species on logged sites. The results of this work demonstrate the power of RF for building climate envelope models and illustrate the utility of consensus projections for incorporating uncertainty about future climate into management planning. It also emphasizes the immediate need for adapting natural resource management to a changing climate. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Longitudinal data refer to the situation where repeated observations are available for each sampled object. Clustered data, where observations are nested in a hierarchical structure within objects (without time necessarily being involved) represent a similar type of situation. Methodologies that take this structure into account allow for the possibilities of systematic differences between objects that are not related to attributes and autocorrelation within objects across time periods. A standard methodology in the statistics literature for this type of data is the mixed effects model, where these differences between objects are represented by so-called "random effects" that are estimated from the data (population-level relationships are termed "fixed effects," together resulting in a mixed effects model). This paper presents a methodology that combines the structure of mixed effects models for longitudinal and clustered data with the flexibility of tree-based estimation methods. We apply the resulting estimation method, called the RE-EM tree, to pricing in online transactions, showing that the RE-EM tree is less sensitive to parametric assumptions and provides improved predictive power compared to linear models with random effects and regression trees without random effects. We also apply it to a smaller data set examining accident fatalities, and show that the RE-EM tree strongly outperforms a tree without random effects while performing comparably to a linear model with random effects. We also perform extensive simulation experiments to show that the estimator improves predictive performance relative to regression trees without random effects and is comparable or superior to using linear models with random effects in more general situations.

AB Appropriate selection of environmental variables is critical to the performance of biodiversity models, but has received less attention than the choice of modelling method. Online aggregators of biological and environmental data, such as the Global Biodiversity Information Facility and the Atlas of Living Australia, necessitate a rational approach to variable selection. We outline a set of general principles for systematically identifying, compiling, evaluating and selecting environmental variables for a biodiversity model. Our approach aims to maximise the information obtained from the analysis of biological records linked to a potentially large suite of spatial environmental variables. We demonstrate the utility of this structured framework through case studies with Australian vascular plants: regional modelling of a species distribution, continent-wide modelling of species compositional turnover and environmental classification. The approach is informed by three components of a biodiversity model: (1) an ecological framework or conceptual model, (2) a data model concerning availability, resolution and variable selection and (3) a method for analysing data. We expand the data model in structuring the problem of choosing environmental variables. The case studies demonstrate a structured approach for the: (1) cost-effective compilation of variables in the context of an explicit ecological framework for the study, attribute accuracy and resolution; (2) evaluation of non-linear relationships between variables using knowledge of their derivation, scatter plots and dissimilarity matrices; (3) selection and grouping of variables based on hypotheses of relative ecological importance and perceived predictor effectiveness; (4) systematic testing of variables as predictors through the process of model building and refinement and (5) model critique, inference and synthesis using direct gradient analysis to evaluate the shape of response curves in the context of ecological theory by presenting predictions in both geographic and environmental space.

AB Critical Zone (CZ) research investigates the chemical, physical, and biological processes that modulate the Earth's surface. Here, we advance 12 hypotheses that must be tested to improve our understanding of the CZ: (1) Solar-to-chemical conversion of energy by plants regulates flows of carbon, water, and nutrients through plant-microbe soil networks, thereby controlling the location and extent of biological weathering. (2) Biological stoichiometry drives changes in mineral stoichiometry and distribution through weathering. (3) On landscapes experiencing little erosion, biology drives weathering during initial succession, whereas weathering drives biology over the long term.(4) In eroding landscapes, weathering-front advance at depth is coupled to surface denudation via biotic processes.(5) Biology shapes the topography of the Critical Zone.(6) The impact of climate forcing on denudation rates in natural systems can be predicted from models incorporating biogeochemical reaction rates and geomorphological transport laws.(7) Rising global temperatures will increase carbon losses from the Critical Zone.(8) Rising atmospheric P-CO2 will increase rates and extents of mineral weathering in soils.(9) Riverine solute fluxes will respond to changes in climate primarily due to changes in water fluxes and secondarily through changes in biologically mediated weathering.(10) Land use change will impact Critical Zone processes and exports more than climate change. (11) In many severely altered settings, restoration of hydrological processes is possible in decades or less, whereas restoration of biodiversity and biogeochemical processes requires longer timescales.(12) Biogeochemical properties impart thresholds or tipping points beyond which rapid and irreversible losses of ecosystem health, function, and services can occur.

AB Telemetry methods and remote sensing now make it possible to record the spatial usage of wide-ranging marine animals and the biophysical characteristics of their pelagic habitats. Furthermore, recent statistical advances mean that such data can be used to test ecological hypotheses and estimate species' distributions. Black-browed Albatrosses Thalassarche melanophrys are highly mobile marine predators with a circumpolar breeding and foraging distribution in the Southern Hemisphere. Although they remain relatively abundant, increased fisheries bycatch has led to their listing as endangered by conservation bodies. We satellite-tracked 163 breeding Black-browed Albatrosses and eight closely related Campbell Albatrosses T. impavida from nine colonies. We then quantified habitat usage, and modeled population-level spatial distribution at spatiotemporal scales >50 km and 1 month, as a function of habitat accessibility, habitat preference, and intraspecific competition, using mixed-effects generalized additive models (GAMM). During incubation, birds foraged over a wider area than in the post-brood chick-rearing period, when they are more time constrained. Throughout breeding, the order of habitat preference of Black-browed Albatrosses was for neritic (0-500 m), shelf-break and upper shelf-slope (500 1000 m), and then oceanic (>1000 m) waters. Black-browed Albatrosses also preferred areas with steeper (>3 degrees) bathymetric relief and, in addition, during incubation, warmer sea surface temperatures (peak preference similar to 16 degrees C). Although this suggests specialization in neritic habitats, incubation-stage Black-browed Albatrosses from South Georgia also foraged extensively in oceanic waters, preferring areas with high eddy kinetic energy (>250 cm(2)/s(2)), especially the Brazil-Malvinas Confluence, a region of intense mesoscale turbulence. During chick-rearing, this species had a more southerly distribution, and following the seasonal retreat of sea ice, birds from some populations utilized neritic polar waters. Campbell Albatrosses showed similar bathymetric preferences but also preferred positive sea level anomalies. Black-browed Albatross foraging areas were partially spatially segregated with respect to colony and region, with birds preferring locations distant from neighboring colonies, presumably in order to reduce competition between parapatric conspecifics. At the global scale, the greatest concentrations of breeding Black-browed Albatrosses are in southern South American neritic, shelf-break, and shelf-slope waters. These regions also hold large fisheries and should therefore be a priority for introduction of bycatch mitigation measures.

AB Temperate species are projected to experience the greatest temperature increases across a range of modelled climate change scenarios, and climate warming has been linked to geographical range and population changes of individual species at such latitudes. However, beyond the multiple modelling approaches, we lack empirical evidence of contemporary climate change impacts on populations in broad taxonomic groups and at continental scales. Identifying reliable predictors of species resilience or susceptibility to climate warming is of critical importance in assessing potential risks to species, ecosystems and ecosystem services. Here we analysed long-term trends of 110 common breeding birds across Europe (20 countries), to identify climate niche characteristics, adjusted to other environmental and life history traits, that predict large-scale population changes accounting for phylogenetic relatedness among species. Beyond the now well-documented decline of farmland specialists, we found that species with the lowest thermal maxima (as the mean spring and summer temperature of the hottest part of the breeding distribution in Europe) showed the sharpest declines between 1980 and 2005. Thermal maximum predicted the recent trends independently of other potential predictors. This study emphasizes the need to account for both land-use and climate changes to assess the fate of species. Moreover, we highlight that thermal maximum appears as a reliable and simple predictor of the long-term trends of such endothermic species facing climate change.

AB Vertical profiles in leaf mass per unit leaf area (M-A), foliar C-13 composition (delta C-13), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), carbon (C) and major cation concentrations were estimated for 204 rain forest trees growing in 57 sites across the Amazon Basin. Data was analysed using a multilevel modelling approach, allowing a separation of gradients within individual tree canopies (within-tree gradients) as opposed to stand level gradients occurring because of systematic differences occurring between different trees of different heights (between-tree gradients). Significant positive within-tree gradients (i.e. increasing values with increasing sampling height) were observed for M-A and [C](DW) (the subscript denoting on a dry weight basis) with negative within-tree gradients observed for delta C-13, [Mg](DW) and [K](DW). No significant within-tree gradients were observed for [N](DW), [P](DW) or [Ca](DW). The magnitudes of between-tree gradients were not significantly different to the within-tree gradients for M-A, delta C-13, [C](DW), [K](DW), [N](DW), [P](DW) and [Ca](DW). But for [Mg](DW), although there was no systematic difference observed between trees of different heights, strongly negative within-tree gradients were found to occur.
   When expressed on a leaf area basis (denoted by the subscript 'A'), significant positive gradients were observed for [N](A), [P](A) and [K](A) both within and between trees, these being attributable to the positive intra- and between-tree gradients in M-A mentioned above. No systematic within-tree gradient was observed for either [Ca](A) or [Mg](A), but with a significant positive gradient observed for [Mg](A) between trees (i.e. with taller trees tending to have a higher Mg per unit leaf area).
   Significant differences in within-tree gradients between individuals were observed only for M-A, delta C-13 and [P] (A). This was best associated with the overall average [P](A) for each tree, this also being considered to be a surrogate for a tree's average leaf area based photosynthetic capacity, A(max). A new model is presented which is in agreement with the above observations. The model predicts that trees characterised by a low upper canopy A(max) should have shallow, or even non-existent, within-canopy gradients in A(max), with optimal intra-canopy gradients becoming sharper as a tree's upper canopy A(max) increases. Nevertheless, in all cases it is predicted that the optimal within-canopy gradient in A(max) should be substantially less than for photon irradiance. Although this is also shown to be consistent with numerous observations as illustrated by a literature survey of gradients in photosynthetic capacity for broadleaf trees, it is also in contrast to previously held notions of optimality. A new equation relating gradients in photosynthetic capacity within broadleaf tree canopies to the photosynthetic capacity of their upper canopy leaves is presented.

AB Soil surface carbon dioxide (CO2) flux (R-S) was measured for 2 years at the Boreal Soil and Air Warming Experiment site near Thompson, MB, Canada. The experimental design was a complete random block design that consisted of four replicate blocks, with each block containing a 15 m x 15 m control and heated plot. Black spruce [Picea mariana (Mill.) BSP] was the overstory species and Epilobium angustifolium was the dominant understory. Soil temperature was maintained (similar to 5 degrees C) above the control soil temperature using electric cables inside water filled polyethylene tubing for each heated plot. Air inside a 7.3-m-diameter chamber, centered in the soil warming plot, contained approximately nine black spruce trees was heated similar to 5 degrees C above control ambient air temperature allowing for the testing of soil-only warming and soil+air warming. Soil surface CO2 flux (R-S) was positively correlated (P < 0.0001) to soil temperature at 10 cm depth. Soil surface CO2 flux (R-S) was 24% greater in the soil-only warming than the control in 2004, but was only 11% greater in 2005, while R-S in the soil+air warming treatments was 31% less than the control in 2004 and 23% less in 2005. Live fine root mass (< 2 mm diameter) was less in the heated than control treatments in 2004 and statistically less (P < 0.01) in 2005. Similar root mass between the two heated treatments suggests that different heating methods (soil-only vs. soil+air warming) can affect the rate of decomposition.

AB Mycorrhizal fungi may play an important role in protecting plants against arsenic (As) contamination. However, little is known about the direct and indirect involvement of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) in detoxification mechanisms. A compartmented pot cultivation system ('cross-pots') is used here to investigate the roles of AMF Glomus mosseae in plant phosphorus (P) and As acquisition by Medicago saliva, and P-As interactions. The results indicate that fungal colonization dramatically increased plant dry weight by a factor of around 6, and also substantially increased both plant P and As contents (i.e. total uptake). Irrespective of P and As addition levels, AM plants had shoot and root P concentrations 2 told higher, but As concentrations significantly lower, than corresponding uninoculated controls. The decreased shoot As concentrations were largely due to "dilution effects" that resulted from stimulated growth of AM plants and reduced As partitioning to shoots. The study provides further evidence for the protective effects of AMF on host plants against As contamination, and have uncovered key aspects of underlying mechanisms. The possible application of AMF in remediation practices is discussed. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The lifestyles of plants affect their approach to photosynthesis. The long-lived evergreen trees must cope with wide temporal variation in water and nutrient availability that herbaceous species largely avoid. Evergreen trees have thus evolved mechanisms to conserve water and nutrients, and to tolerate water and nutrient stress. However, some of these adaptations have a cost. For example, evergreen trees have lower rates of photosynthesis per unit nitrogen, which can be partly explained by the use of Rubisco for nitrogen storage and the higher internal resistance to CO2 diffusion. The high internal resistance to diffusion of CO2 in evergreen trees might be an unavoidable consequence of anatomical and biochemical traits associated with leaf longevity, nutrient conservation and/or drought tolerance.

AB The effects of nitrogen availability on growth and photosynthesis were followed in plants of sunflower (Helianthus annuus L., var. CATISSOL-01) grown in the greenhouse under natural photoperiod. The sunflower plants were grown in vermiculite under two contrasting nitrogen supply, with nitrogen supplied as ammonium nitrate. Higher nitrogen concentration resulted in higher shoot dry matter production per plant and the effect was apparent from 29 days after sowing (DAS). The difference in dry matter production was mainly attributed to the effect of nitrogen on leaf production and on individual leaf dry matter. The specific leaf weight (SLW) was not affected by the nitrogen supply. The photosynthetic CO2 assimilation (A) of the target leaves was remarkably improved by high nitrogen nutrition. However, irrespective of nitrogen supply, the decline in photosynthetic CO2 assimilation occurred before the end of leaf growth. Although nitrogen did not change significantly stomatal conductance (gs), high-N grown plants had lower intercellular CO2 concentration (C-i) when compared with low-N grown plants. Transpiration rate (E) was increased in high-N grown plants only at the beginning of leaf growth. However, this not resulted in lower intrinsic water use efficiency (WUE).

AB This study compares two approaches for constructing diatom-based indices for monitoring river eutrophication. The first approach is based on weighted averaging of species indicator values with the underlying assumption that species have symmetrical unimodal distributions along the nutrient gradient, and their distributions are sufficiently described by a single indicator value per species. The second approach uses multiple indicator values for individual taxa and is based on the possibility that species have complex asymmetrical response curves. Multiple indicator values represent relative probabilities that a species would be found within certain ranges of nutrient concentration. We used 155 benthic diatom samples collected from rivers in the Northern Piedmont ecoregion (Northeastern U. S. A.) to construct two datasets: one used for developing models and indices, and another for testing them. To characterize the shape of species response curves we analyzed changes in the relative abundance of 118 diatom taxa common in this dataset along the total phosphorus (TP) gradient by fitting parametric and non-parametric regression models. We found that only 34 diatoms had symmetrical unimodal response to TP. Among several indices that use a single indicator value for each species, the best was the weighted averaging partial least square (WA-PLS) inference model. The correlation coefficient between observed and inferred TP in the test dataset was 0.67. The best index that employed multiple indicator values for each species had approximately the same predictive power as the WA-PLS based index, but in addition, this index provided a sample-specific measure of uncertainty for the TP estimation.

AB Recent advances in the large-scale sequencing of mammalian genomes have provided a means to study divergence in not only genic sequences but also in the non-coding bulk of DNA. There is evidence of significant variation in the levels of divergence between presumably neutral regions, pointing at an underlying variation in the rate of mutation across the genome. Apparently, such variation occurs on different scales, including sequence context effects (the influence of neighboring nucleotides on the rate of mutation at individual sites), variation within chromosomes (on the scales of kilobases as well as megabases), and between chromosomes (among autosomes as well as between autosomes and sex chromosomes). An important aspect for further research in this area is to study whether there is an ultimate evolutionary explanation for mutation rate variation within mammalian genomes.

AB We test hypotheses for the evolution of a life history trait among a group of parasitoid wasps (Hymenoptera: Ichneumonoidea), namely, the transition among koinobiont parasitoids (parasitoids whose hosts continue development after oviposition) between attacking exposed hosts and attacking hosts that are concealed within plant tissue. Using a range of phylogeny estimates based on 28S rDNA sequences, we use maximum parsimony (MP) and maximum likelihood (ML) methods to estimate the ancestral life history traits for the main clades in which both traits occur (using the programs MacClade and Discrete, respectively). We also assess the robustness of these estimates; for MP, we use step matrices in PAUP* to find the minimum weight necessary to reverse estimates or make them ambiguous, and for ML, we measure the differences in likelihood after fixing the ancestral nodes at the alternative states. We also measure the robustness of the MP ancestral state estimate against uncertainties in the phylogeny estimate, manipulating the most-parsimonious tree in MacClade to find the shortest suboptimal tree in which the ancestral state estimate is reversed or made ambiguous. Using these methods, we find strong evidence supporting two transitions among koinobiont Ichneumonoidea: (1) to attacking exposed hosts in a clade consisting of the Helconinae and related subfamilies, and (2) the reverse transition in a clade consisting of the Euphorinae and related subfamilies. In exploring different methods of analyzing variable-length DNA sequences, we found that direct optimization with POY gave some clearly erroneous results that had a profound effect on the overall phylogeny estimate. We also discuss relationships within the superfamily and expand the Mesostoinae to include all the gall-associated braconids that form the sister group of the Aphidiinae.

AB Whilst the use of molecular genetic techniques is widespread in the fields of population and evolutionary biology, their application within the mammalian order Chiroptera neither reflects the species richness nor the ecological and behavioural diversity of the order. This is despite the fact that the Chiroptera are problematic to study using more direct observational techniques. Here, we standardize and synthesise the current data, assess the contribution of molecular research to the study of bat species and highlight the importance of its continued and expanded use. At an inter-population level, molecular studies have demonstrated a great diversity of population genetic structure within the order. Among populations of migratory species, genetic structure appears universally low, and hence seasonal movement is likely to be the prevailing influence. However, for sedentary species an array of factors including dispersal ability, extrinsic barriers to gene flow and historical events may determine the extent of genetic partitioning among populations. Intrinsic factors such as wing morphology or roost requirements may also influence population genetic structure in sedentary bat species, a proposal which requires further research. Molecular studies have also made important contributions towards an understanding of social organisation in bats. Evidence indicates that in many polygynous species male mating success does not translate directly into reproductive success, perhaps as a result of multiple mating by females. Estimates of relatedness within and genetic structure among colonies are, in general, very low; a finding which has important implications regarding theories concerning the formation and persistence of bat social groups. Molecular studies have provided new and important insights into the ecology of bats, and have opened up exciting and previously unexplored avenues of research. The data from these studies suggest not only a predictive framework for future studies, but also the use of genetic data in the management and conservation of bat species.

AB Phylogenetic relationships among frogs of the genus Rana from western North America are investigated using 2013 aligned bases of mitochondrial DNA sequence from the genes encoding ND1 (subunit one of NADH dehydrogenase), tRNA(Ile), tRNA(Gln), tRNA(Met), ND2, tRNA(Trp), tRNA(Aln), tRNA(ASn), tRNA(Cys), tRNA(Tyr), and COI (subunit I of cytochrome c oxidase), plus the origin for light-strand replication (OL) between the tRNA(Asn) and tRNA(Cys) genes. The aligned sequences contain 401 phylogenetically informative characters. A well-resolved phylogenetic hypothesis in which the Rana boylii species group (R. aurora, R. boylii, R. cascadae, R. muscosa, and R. pretiosa) is monophyletic is obtained. Molecular sequence divergence suggests that the R. boylii species group is approximately 8 million years old. The traditional hypothesis showing monophyly of the yellow-legged frogs (R. boylii and R. muscosa) is statistically rejected in favor of a hypothesis in which R. aurora, R. cascadae, and R. muscosa form a clade. Reanalyses of published nuclear ribosomal DNA restriction-site data and allozymic data support a monophyletic R. boylii group, but do not effectively resolve relationships among species within this group. Eight populations of R. muscosa form two major clades separated by a biogeographic break in the Sierra Nevada of California. This biogeographic break is broadly concordant with breaks found in four other amphibian and reptilian taxa, The two major clades within R. muscosa are estimated to have diverged approximately 2.2 million years before present. Each of these major clades contains two subgroups showing approximately 1.5 million years divergence, implicating climatic effects of Pleistocene glaciation in vicariance. The four distinct subgroups of R. muscosa separated by at least 1.4 million years of evolutionary divergence are suggested as potential units for conservation. (C) 2001 Academic Press.

AB We examined post-fire responses of two sympatric Australian rodents, Pseudomys gracilicaudatus and Rattus lutreolus, as coastal wet heath regenerated following two high intensity wildfires. Pseudomys gracilicaudatus, an early seral-stage species, recolonized an area burnt in August 1974 after one year, but took only 3 months to recolonize another area following a wildfire in October 1994. Rattus lutreolus, a late seral-stage specialist, took approximately 3.6 years to recolonize following wildfire in August 1974, but had recolonized after only 4 months following wildfire in October 1994. We suggest that this apparent anomaly is associated with the rate of recovery of vegetation density. When the relative abundance of each species was plotted as a function of vegetation density, the trajectories following the two wildfires were concordant. An implicit relationship exists between time since wildfire and vegetation density. We make this relationship explicit by quantifying cover requirements for each species, and show that it is the resource continuum borne of regenerating vegetation (rather than time per se) that is important in determining the timing of small mammal successional sequences.

AB Phylogeographic patterns of intraspecific variation can provide insights into the population-level processes responsible for speciation and yield information useful for conservation purposes. To examine phylogeography and population structure in a migratory passerine bird at both continental and regional geographical scales, we analysed 344 bp of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region sequence from 155 yellow warblers (Dendroica petechia) collected from seven locations across Canada and from Alaska. There is a major subdivision between eastern (Manitoba to Newfoundland) and western (Alaska and British Columbia) populations which appears to have developed during the recent Pleistocene. Some localities within these two regions also differ significantly in their genetic composition, suggesting further subdivision on a regional geographical scale. Eastern and western birds form distinct phylogeographic entities and the clustering of all western haplotypes with two eastern haplotypes suggests that the western haplotypes may be derived from an eastern lineage. Analyses based on coalescent models support this explanation for the origin of western haplotypes. These results are consistent with important features of Mengel's model of warbler diversification. From a conservation perspective they also suggest that individual populations of migrant birds may form demographically isolated management units on a smaller scale than previously appreciated.

AB The primate lentiviruses comprise SIV strains from various host species, as well as two viruses, HIV-1 and HIV-2, that cause AIDS in humans. The origins of HIV-1 and HIV-2 have been traced to cross-species transmissions from chimpanzees and sooty mangabey monkeys respectively. Two approaches have been taken to estimate the timescale of the evolution of these viruses. Certain groups of SIV strains appear to have evolved in a host-dependent manner, implying a time-scale of many thousands or even millions of years. In stark contrast, molecular clock calculations have previously been used to estimate a time-scale of only tens or hundreds of years. Those calculations largely ignored heterogeneity of evolutionary rates across different sites within sequences. In fact, the distribution of rates at different sites seems extremely skewed in HIV-1, and so the time-depth of the primate lentivirus evolutionary tree may have been underestimated by at least a factor of ten. However, these date estimates still seem to be far too recent to be consistent with host-dependent evolution.

TI Soil management and supplemental irrigation effects on potato: II. Root

SO AGRONOMY JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
ID WATER-STRESS; CROPS; SHOOT
AB This study was conducted to determine if supplemental irrigation and/or application of soil amendments rich in organic matter can improve root growth of potato (Solanum tuberosum L.). Root length density (RLD) and root drg matter production of potato were studied under two levels of supplemental irrigation (nonirrigated check vs. moderate irrigation) and two levels of soil amendments [none vs. amended with compost and manure from beef rattle (Bos taurus L.)] during 1993 and 1994, Amendments significantly increased RLD during both growing seasons and these increases occurred consistently throughout each growing season, Irrigation effects were not observed in 1993, while irrigation significantly increased RLD during 1993, Approximately 85% of the root length was concentrated in the upper 30-cm layer of the soil. The supplemental irrigation and soil amendment treatments did not affect the proportional distribution of roots among the soil layers. Root-to-shoot ratio was not affected by irrigation or amendment during either growing season. The RLD and leaf area index (LAI) at all four sample dates during 1994 were significantly correlated with final tuber yields, indicating that growth patterns early in the season were important in establishing the productivity of the potato crop. Root length density tended to have a higher correlation with yields than did LAI (r = 0.58* to 0.80** vs, 0.51* to 0.68**).

AB We examined the effects of variation in intra- and intercohort density on the magnitude and form of per capita juvenile mortality rates of three species of damselfish (Dascyllus spp.) at Moorea, French Polynesia. Patterns of mortality over a 2-wk period were estimated from daily counts of new settlers and of the next older age class (<1 mo old) following a natural settlement pulse to standard amounts of suitable microhabitat. Two spatial scales were explored: among 11 lagoon sites dispersed evenly around the 60-km perimeter of the island and among microhabitats within a site. For each species at both spatial scales, per capita mortality rates of new settler cohorts increased monotonically with density, whereas those of the next older cohort were density independent. Intra- and especially intercohort processes induced density-dependent mortality in new settler cohorts. Despite experimental densities that were only 15-25% of ambient, similar to 50% of the spatial variance in settler abundance was reduced by density-dependent mortality in 2 wk. The relative contributions of primary recruitment limitation and subsequent density-dependent loss in setting the average abundance of 2-wk-old recruits were estimated to be similar to 70% and similar to 12%, respectively. Our findings demonstrate that density-dependent mortality may only occur for a brief period immediately after settlement of at least some reef fishes and that its influence can be relatively large at comparatively low densities. These results have major implications for current assessments of the relative importance of the processes that drive abundance and dynamics of species with demographically open populations.

AB We used sequence variation within 297 bp of control region mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) amplified from 53 lesser long-nosed bats, Leptonycteris curasoae (Phyllostomidae: Glossophaginae) captured at 13 locations in south-western United States and Mexico and one site in Venezuela to infer population structure and possible migration routes of this endangered nectar- and fruit-eating species. Phylogenetic analysis using maximum parsimony and UPGMA confirmed species and subspecies distinctions within Leptonycteris and revealed two clades exhibiting 3% sequence divergence within the Mexican subspecies, L. c. yerbabuenae. Even though many roosts contained L. c. yerbabuenae from both clades, weak population structure was detected both by a correlation between genetic differentiation, F-st, and geographical distance and by a cladistic estimate of the number of migration events required to align bat sequences with geographical location on maximum parsimony, as compared to random, trees. Three results suggest that L. c. yerbabuenae are more likely to migrate between sites along the Pacific coast of Mexico or along the foothills of the Sierra Madre Occidental than between these regions. (1) Seventeen of 20 bats which shared an identical sequence were captured up to 1800 km apart but within the same putative migration corridor. (2) Residuals from a regression of F-st on distance were greater between than within these regions. (3) Fewer migration events were required to align bats with these two groups than expected from random assignment. We recommend analysing independent genetic data and monitoring bat visitation to roost sites during migration to confirm these postulated movements.

AB A simple analytical scheme, involving the distribution of nitrogen, to scale up photosynthesis from leaf to canopy is proposed, The scheme is based on the assumption that there are two pools of nitrogen in leaves: nitrogen in photosynthetic, degradable structures (N-p) and nitrogen in non-photosynthetic and non-degradable structures (N-s). The rate of photon-saturated photosynthesis, F-m, is assumed to be proportional to N-p and is distributed inside the canopy similarly to photon flux density (PFD). Prior assumptions of an optimum distribution of nitrogen are not a prerequisite, Calculations made with the scheme lead to development of the hypothesis that the canopy can be treated as a 'big leaf' on the time scales involved in acclimation of photosynthesis to PFD, Simulations using parameters for tree species with different requirements for PFD show that shade-tolerant species may have denser canopies than sun-demanding species because of smaller amounts of non-photosynthetic structural nitrogen and/or supporting tissue in their leaves.

AB Precision agriculture requires high-resolution information to enable greater precision in the management of inputs to production. Actionable information about crop and field status must be acquired at high spatial resolution and at a temporal frequency appropriate for timely responses. In this study, high spatial resolution imagery was obtained through the use of a small, unmanned aerial system called AggieAir (TM). Simultaneously with the AggieAir flights, intensive ground sampling for plant chlorophyll was conducted at precisely determined locations. This study reports the application of a relevance vector machine coupled with cross validation and backward elimination to a dataset composed of reflectance from high-resolution multi-spectral imagery (VIS-NIR), thermal infrared imagery, and vegetative indices, in conjunction with in situ SPAD measurements from which chlorophyll concentrations were derived, to estimate chlorophyll concentration from remotely sensed data at 15-cm resolution. The results indicate that a relevance vector machine with a thin plate spline kernel type and kernel width of 5.4, having LAI, NDVI, thermal and red bands as the selected set of inputs, can be used to spatially estimate chlorophyll concentration with a root-mean-squared-error of 5.31 mu g cm(-2), efficiency of 0.76, and 9 relevance vectors.

AB Birds are conspicuous in many habitats, occur worldwide, are ecologically diverse, and are better known than other vertebrate groups. Birds devour pests, pollinate flowers, disperse seeds, scavenge carrion, cycle nutrients, and modify the environment in ways that benefit other species. Investigation of these ecosystem functions directly as ecosystem services has grown immensely over the last two decades and the ecological relevance of birds is well established. Birds are also observed, fed, and used as artistic and spiritual inspiration by millions of people around the globe. Yet the economic relevance of birds is not widely appreciated and the economic relevance to human society of birds' ecological roles is even less understood. Quantifying the services provided by birds is crucial to understand their importance for ecosystems and for the people that benefit from them. In this paper, we briefly review the rise and fall of economic ornithology and call for a new economic ornithology with heightened standards and a holistic focus within the ecosystem services approach. Birds' ecological roles, and therefore, ecosystem services, are critical to the health of many ecosystems and to human well-being. By understanding and valuing bird services and disservices through careful natural history research, we can better assess the environmental consequences of bird declines and extinctions and communicate these findings to the public and policy makers, thereby increasing public support for the conservation of birds and their habitats.

AB A significant fraction of carbon stored in the Earth's soil moves through arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) and ectomycorrhiza (EM). The impacts of AM and EM on the soil carbon budget are poorly understood. We propose a method to quantify the mycorrhizal contribution to carbon cycling, explicitly accounting for the abundance of plant-associated and extraradical mycorrhizal mycelium. We discuss the need to acquire additional data to use our method, and present our new global database holding information on plant species-by-site intensity of root colonization by mycorrhizas. We demonstrate that the degree of mycorrhizal fungal colonization has globally consistent patterns across plant species. This suggests that the level of plant species-specific root colonization can be used as a plant trait. To exemplify our method, we assessed the differential impacts of AM:EM ratio and EM shrub encroachment on carbon stocks in sub-arctic tundra. AM and EM affect tundra carbon stocks at different magnitudes, and via partly distinct dominant pathways: via extraradical mycelium (both EM and AM) and via mycorrhizal impacts on above- and belowground biomass carbon (mostly AM). Our method provides a powerful tool for the quantitative assessment of mycorrhizal impact on local and global carbon cycling processes, paving the way towards an improved understanding of the role of mycorrhizas in the Earth's carbon cycle.

AB How common are cryptic species - those overlooked because of their morphological similarity? Despite its wide-ranging implications for biology and conservation, the answer remains open to debate. Butterflies constitute the best-studied invertebrates, playing a similar role as birds do in providing models for vertebrate biology. An accurate assessment of cryptic diversity in this emblematic group requires meticulous case-by-case assessments, but a preview to highlight cases of particular interest will help to direct future studies. We present a survey of mitochondrial genetic diversity for the butterfly fauna of the Iberian Peninsula with unprecedented resolution (3502 DNA barcodes for all 228 species), creating a reliable system for DNA-based identification and for the detection of overlooked diversity. After compiling available data for European butterflies (5782 sequences, 299 species), we applied the Generalized Mixed Yule-Coalescent model to explore potential cryptic diversity at a continental scale. The results indicate that 27.7% of these species include from two to four evolutionary significant units (ESUs), suggesting that cryptic biodiversity may be higher than expected for one of the best-studied invertebrate groups and regions. The ESUs represent important units for conservation, models for studies of evolutionary and speciation processes, and sentinels for future research to unveil hidden diversity.

AB This study investigates the utility of in situ and satellite-based leaf chlorophyll (Chl) estimates for quantifying leaf photosynthetic capacity and for constraining model simulations of Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) over a corn field in Maryland, U.S.A. The maximum rate of carboxylation (V-max) represents a key control on leaf photosynthesis within the widely employed C-3 and C-4 photosynthesis models proposed by Farquhar et al. (1980) and Collatz et al. (1992), respectively. A semi-mechanistic relationship between V-max(5) (V-max normalized to 25 degrees C) and Chl is derived based on interlinkages between V-max(25), Rubisco enzyme kinetics, leaf nitrogen, and Chl reported in the experimental literature. The resulting linear V-max(25) - Chl relationship is embedded within the photosynthesis scheme of the Community Land Model (CLM), thereby bypassing the use of fixed plant functional type (PFT) specific V-max(25) values. The effect of the updated parameterization on simulated carbon fluxes is tested over a corn field growing season using: (1) a detailed Chl time-series established on the basis of intensive field measurements and (2) Chl estimates derived from Landsat imagery using the REGularized canopy reFLECtance (REGFLEC) tool. Validations against flux tower observations demonstrate benefit of using Chl to parameterize V-max(25) to account for variations in nitrogen availability imposed by severe environmental conditions. The use of V-max(25) that varied seasonally as a function of satellite-based Chl, rather than a fixed PFT-specific value, significantly improved the agreement with observed tower fluxes with Pearson's correlation coefficient (r) increasing from 0.88 to 0.93 and the root-mean-square-deviation decreasing from 4.77 to 3.48 mu mol m(-2) s(-1). The results support the use of Chl as a proxy for photosynthetic capacity using generalized relationships between V-max(25) and Chl, and advocate the potential of satellite retrieved Chl for constraining simulations of GPP in space and time.

AB Based on recent research on erosion of ecosystem services, planetary boundaries and predicted pace of urbanization, it is now apparent that humans need to reconnect to the biosphere and that cities in this context, properly managed, could provide great opportunities and arenas for social ecological change and transformation towards sustainability To take advantage of these opportunities one needs to keep in mind that most of the ecosystem services consumed in cities are generated by ecosystems located outside of the cities themselves, not seldom half a world away. In order to operationalize our knowledge, hypothesis and theories on the connections between the work of nature and the welfare and survival of humans overtime, we suggest the use of the ecosystem service framework in combination with the merging of the concept "ecology in cities", mainly focusing on designing energy efficient building, sustainable logistics and providing inhabitants with healthy and functioning green urban environments, and the "ecology of dries". The "ecology of cities" framework acknowledges the total dependence of cities on the surrounding landscape and the ever-ongoing dance between urban and rural, viewing the city as an ecosystem.

AB Urban areas are among the most heavily managed landscapes in the world, yet they harbor a remarkable richness of species. Private yards are common habitats in urban areas and are places where cultivated species manage to escape cultivation and become part of the spontaneous species pool. Yards are novel ecosystems where community assembly is driven by both natural and anthropogenic processes. Phylogenetic diversity and functional traits are increasingly recognized as critical to understanding processes of community assembly. Recent evidence indicates that urban areas may select more closely related plant species from the pool of regionally occurring species than do nonurban areas, and that exotic species are phylogenetically clustered within communities. We tested whether phylogenetic diversity and functional trait composition in privately managed yards change along a gradient of housing density in the Minneapolis-Saint Paul metropolis, Minnesota, USA, in accordance with these predictions. We also identified characteristics of the spontaneous yard flora by comparing its phylogenetic diversity and functional composition with the "natural-areas'' species pool represented by the flora of nearby Cedar Creek Ecosystem Science Reserve. Along the urbanization gradient, yards had more species per hectare in densely built regions than in lower-density regions, but phylogenetic diversity and functional composition did not change with housing density. In contrast, in comparison to species in natural areas, yard species were more closely related to each other and functionally distinct: They were more often short-lived, self-compatible, and had higher specific leaf area than species of Cedar Creek. The high number of exotic yard species increased the yard flora's phylogenetic relatedness in comparison to species of Cedar Creek, causing a degree of phylogenetic homogenization within yards. The urban environment and homeowners' preferences select for trait attributes and phylogenetic lineages that can colonize and persist in yards. As yard species disperse beyond household boundaries, their functional attributes will affect ecosystem processes in urban environments and beyond, such as accelerating decomposition rates. Limited phylogenetic diversity may reduce the potential of ecosystems to respond to environmental changes. As cities continue to expand globally, understanding the impacts of yard management for biodiversity and ecosystem services becomes increasingly important.

AB In many densely settled agricultural watersheds, water quality is a point of conflict between amenity and agricultural activities because of the varied demands and impacts on shared water resources. Successful governance of these watersheds requires coordination among different activities. Recent research has highlighted the role that social networks between management entities can play to facilitate cross-scale interaction in watershed governance. For example, bridging organizations can be positioned in social networks to bridge local initiatives done by single municipalities across whole watersheds. To better understand the role of social networks in social-ecological system dynamics, we combine a social network analysis of the water quality management networks held by local governments with a social-ecological analysis of variation in water management and ecosystem services across the Monteregie, an agricultural landscape near Montreal, Quebec, Canada. We analyze municipal water management networks by using one-mode networks to represent direct collaboration between municipalities, and two-mode networks to capture how bridging organizations indirectly connect municipalities. We find that municipalities do not collaborate directly with one another but instead are connected via bridging organizations that span the water quality management network. We also discovered that more connected municipalities engaged in more water management activities. However, bridging organizations preferentially connected with municipalities that used more tourism related ecosystem services rather than those that used more agricultural ecosystem services. Many agricultural municipalities were relatively isolated, despite being the main producers of water quality problems. In combination, these findings suggest that further strengthening the water management network in the Monteregie will contribute to improving water quality in the region. However, such strengthening requires developing a network that better connects both agricultural and tourism oriented municipalities. Furthermore, these findings show that consideration of the social-ecological context of social networks, can help explain the structure of networks and reveal social-ecological clusters and disconnects in a network.

AB 1. Northern Australia is characterised by a tropical wet-dry climate that regulates the distinctive character of river flow regimes across the region. There is marked hydrological seasonality, with most flow occurring over only a few months of the year during the wet season. Flow is also characterised by high variability between years, and in the degree of flow cessation, or intermittency, over the dry season.
   2. At present, the relatively low human population density and demand for water in the region means that most rivers have largely unmodified flow regimes. These rivers therefore provide a good opportunity to understand the role of natural flow variability in river ecosystem structure and processes.
   3. This review describes the major flow regime classes characterising northern Australian rivers, from perennial to seasonally intermittent to extremely intermittent, and how these regimes give rise to marked differences in the ecological character of these tropical rivers, particularly their floodplains.
   4. We describe the key features of these flow regimes, namely the wet and dry seasons and the transitions between these seasons, and how they regulate the biophysical heterogeneity, primary productivity and movement of biota in Australia's wet-dry tropical rivers.
   5. We develop a conceptual model that predicts the likely hydrological and ecological consequences of future increases in water abstraction (e. g. for agriculture), and suggest how such impacts can be managed so that the distinctive ecological character of these rivers is maintained.

AB Tritrophic interactions (plant-herbivore-natural enemy) are basic components of nearly all ecosystems, and are often heavily shaped by bottom-up forces. Numerous factors influence plants' growth, defense, reproduction, and survival. One critical factor in plant life histories and subsequent trophic levels is nitrogen (N). Because of its importance to plant productivity, N is one of the most frequently used anthropogenic fertilizers in agricultural production and can exert a variety of bottom-up effects and potentially significantly alter tritrophic interactions through various mechanisms. In this paper, the potential effects of N on tritrophic interactions are reviewed. First, in plant-herbivore interactions, N availability can alter quality of the plant (from the herbivore's nutritional perspective) as food by various means. Second, nitrogen effects can extend directly to natural enemies through herbivores by changes in herbivore quality vis-A -vis the natural enemy, and may even provide herbivores with a defense against natural enemies. Nitrogen also may affect the plant's indirect defenses, namely the efficacy of natural enemies that kill herbivores attacking the plant. The effects may be expressed via (1) quantitatively and/or qualitatively changing herbivore-induced plant volatiles or other plant features that are crucial for foraging and attack success of natural enemies, (2) modifying plant architecture that might affect natural enemy function, and (3) altering the quality of plant-associated food and shelter for natural enemies. These effects, and their interactive top-down and bottom-up influences, have received limited attention to date, but are of growing significance with the need for expanding global food production (with accompanying use of fertilizer amendments), the widening risks of fertilizer pollution, and the continued increase in atmospheric CO2.

AB The possible effects of changing climate on a southern and a north-eastern English river (the Thames and the Yorkshire Ouse, respectively) were examined in relation to water and ecological quality throughout the food web. The CLASSIC hydrological model, driven by output from the Hadley Centre climate model (HadCM3), based on IPCC low and high CO2 emission scenarios for 2080 were used as the basis for the analysis. Compared to current conditions, the CLASSIC model predicted lower flows for both rivers, in all seasons except winter. Such an outcome would lead to longer residence times (by tip to a month in the Thames), with nutrient, organic and biological contaminant concentrations elevated by 70-100% pro-rata, assuming sewage treatment effectiveness remains unchanged. Greater opportunities for phytoplankton growth will arise, and this may be significant in the Thames. Warmer winters and milder Springs will favour riverine birds and increase the recruitment of many coarse fish species. However, warm, slow-flowing, shallower-water would increase the incidence of fish diseases. These changing conditions would make Southern UK rivers in general a less favourable habitat for some species of fish, such as the Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). Accidental or deliberate, introductions of alien macrophytes and fish may change the range of species in the rivers. In some areas, it is possible that a concurrence of different pressures may give rise to the temporary loss of ecosystem services, such as providing acceptable quality water for humans and industry. An increasing demand for water in southern England due to an expanding population, a possibly reduced flow due to climate change. together with the Water Framework Directive obligation to maintain water quality, will put extreme pressure on river ecosystems, such as the Thames.

AB Gene flow in natural populations may be strongly influenced by landscape features. The integration of landscape characteristics in population genetic studies may thus improve our understanding of population functioning. In this study, we investigated the population genetic structure and gene flow pattern for the common vole, Microtus arvalis, in a heterogeneous landscape characterised by strong spatial and temporal variation. The studied area is an intensive agricultural zone of approximately 500 km(2) crossed by a motorway. We used individual-based Bayesian methods to define the number of population units and their spatial borders without prior delimitation of such units. Unexpectedly, we determined a single genetic unit that covered the entire area studied. In particular, the motorway considered as a likely barrier to dispersal was not associated with any spatial genetic discontinuity. Using computer simulations, we demonstrated that recent anthropogenic barriers to effective dispersal are difficult to detect through analysis of genetic variation for species with large effective population sizes. We observed a slight, but significant, pattern of isolation by distance over the whole study site. Spatial autocorrelation analyses detected genetic structuring on a local scale, most probably due to the social organisation of the study species. Overall, our analysis suggests intense small-scale dispersal associated with a large effective population size. High dispersal rates may be imposed by the strong spatio-temporal heterogeneity of habitat quality, which characterises intensive agroecosystems.

AB An analysis of mitochondrial DNA sequence variation in 172 three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) sampled across the European distribution range revealed three major evolutionary lineages occupying relatively large and separate geographic areas. The trans-Atlantic lineage comprised of populations spanning from the East Coast of USA to the continental Europe and was basal group to the other European lineages in the phylogeny. The European lineage included populations located in the Western and Eastern Europe, British Isles, Scandinavia as well as some parts of the Mediterranean region. The third lineage was specific to the Black Sea drainages. The within lineage structure was characterized by significant excess of low frequency haplotypes and star-like mtDNA genealogies, which suggest a recent population expansions to the formerly glaciated marine and freshwater environments. A coalescent-based method dated the splits between the major lineages to have occurred during the Saalian and Weichselian glaciations in the late Pleistocene, depending on the molecular clock calibration. The coalescent simulations further indicate high degree of genetic diversity within the lineages and a substantial increase in the genetic diversity in the European lineage relative to the ancestral level. In addition to the three major lineages, the freshwater populations in R. Neretva and L. Skadar in the Adriatic Sea coast region harboured unique and highly divergent haplotypes suggesting long independent histories of these populations. Evidence from mtDNA analyses suggests that these populations deserve a status of an evolutionary significant unit. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Inbreeding is unavoidable in small, isolated populations and can cause substantial fitness reductions compared to outbred populations. This loss of fitness has been predicted to elevate extinction risk giving it substantial conservation significance. Inbreeding may result in reduced fitness for two reasons: an increased expression of deleterious recessive alleles (partial dominance hypothesis) or the loss of favourable heterozygote combinations (overdominance hypothesis). Because both these sources of inbreeding depression are dependent upon dominance variance, inbreeding depression is predicted to be greater in life history traits than in morphological traits. In this study we used replicate inbred and control lines of Drosophila simulans to address three questions:1) is inbreeding depression greater in life history than morphological traits? 2) which of the two hypotheses is the major underlying cause of inbreeding depression? 3) does inbreeding elevate population extinction risk? We found that inbreeding depression was significantly greater in life history traits compared to morphological traits, but were unable to find unequivocal support for either the overdominance or partial dominance hypotheses as the genetic basis of inbreeding depression. As predicted, inbred lines had a significantly greater extinction risk.

AB Resource quality (plant nitrogen) and resource quantity (plant density) have often been argued to be among the most important factors influencing herbivore densities. A difficulty inherent in the studies that manipulate resource quality, by changing nutrient levels, is that resource quantity can be influenced simultaneously, i.e. fertilized plants grow more. In this study we disentangled the potentially confounding effects of plant quality and quantity on herbivore trophic dynamics by separately manipulating nutrients and plant density, while simultaneously reducing pressure from natural enemies (parasitoids) in a fully factorial design. Plant quality of the sea oxeye daisy, Borrichia frutescens, a common coastal species in Florida, was manipulated by adding nitrogen fertilizer to increase and sugar to decrease available nitrogen. Plant density was manipulated by pulling by hand 25 or 50% of Borrichia stems on each plot. Because our main focal herbivore was a gall making fly, Asphondylia borrichiae, which attacks only the apical meristems of plants, manipulating plant nitrogen levels was a convenient and reliable way to change plant quality without impacting quantity because fertilizer and sugar altered plant nitrogen content but not plant density. Our other focal herbivore was a sap-sucker, Pissonotus quadripustulatus, which taps the main veins of leaves. Parasitism of both herbivores was reduced via yellow sticky traps that caught hymenopteran parasitoids. Plant quality significantly affected the per stem density of both herbivores, with fertilization increasing, and sugar decreasing the densities of the two species but stem density manipulations had no significant effects. Parasitoid removal significantly increased the densities of both herbivores. Top-down manipulations resulted in a trophic cascade, as the density of Borrichia stems decreased significantly on parasitoid removal plots. This is because reduced parasitism increases gall density and galls can kill plant stems. In this system, plant quality and natural enemies impact per stem herbivore population densities but plant density does not.

AB This study assessed potential changes in the distributions of Australian butterfly species in response to global warming. The bioclimatic program, BIOCLIM, was used to determine the current climatic ranges of 77 butterfly species restricted to Australia. We found that the majority of these species had fairly wide climatic ranges in comparison to other taxa, with only 8% of butterfly species having a mean annual temperature range spanning less than 3 degreesC.
   The potential changes in the distributions of 24 butterfly species under four climate change scenarios for 2050 were also modelled using BIOCLIM. Results suggested that even species with currently wide climatic ranges may still be vulnerable to climate change; under a very conservative climate change scenario (with a temperature increase of 0.8-1.4 degreesC by 2050) 88% of species distributions decreased, and 54% of species distributions decreased by at least 20%. Under an extreme scenario (temperature increase of 2.1-3.9 degreesC by 2050) 92% of species distributions decreased, and 83% of species distributions decreased by at least 50%. Furthermore, the proportion of the current range that was contained within the predicted range decreased from an average of 63% under a very conservative scenario to less than 22% under the most extreme scenario.
   By assessing the climatic ranges that species are currently exposed to, the extent of potential changes in distributions in response to climate change and details of their life histories, we identified species whose characteristics may make them particularly vulnerable to climate change in the future.

AB The historical distribution of the brown bear (Ursus arctos) in North America included Alaska, western Canada, the western and midwestern states, plus northern Mexico. Currently, the brown bear is limited to Alaska, the Canadian provinces of the Yukon, Northwest Territories, British Columbia, and Alberta, and six threatened subpopulations in the lower 48 states. To examine the evolutionary history of U. arctos in North America and to assess the genetic divergence between individuals from different geographic regions, we obtained 294 nucleotides of mitochrondrial DNA sequence data from the control region for 317 free-ranging brown bears. Twenty-eight unique sequences, or mitochondrial DNA haplotypes were detected. The average sequence divergence between haplotypes was high (4.3%), and some haplotypes differed by as many as 23 nucleotides. Phylogenetic analyses using maximum parsimony revealed four major mitochondrial DNA phylogeographic groups, or clades. The significant phylogeographic structure detected in brown bears strongly contrasts with results obtained for other larger carnivores and suggests limited female-mediated gene flow. The mitochondrial DNA phylogeographic clades do not correlate with taxonomic classifications for U. arctos, and we hypothesize that the clades were formed prior to migration of this species into North America. We suggest evolutionarily significant units for conservation in three geographic regions: (1) the Alaskan islands of Admiralty, Baranof, and Chichagof; (2) mainland Alaska, Kodiak Island, and northern Canada; and (3) southern British Columbia, southern Alberta, and the states of Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming.

AB Recent studies have provided evidence that species diversity and distributions in continental biotas reflect a long history of responses (e.g. range shifts, speciation or adaptation) to habitat changes produced by geological activity over the past several million years (deep time) as well as glacial-interglacial cycles over the most recent hundreds of thousands of years (shallow time). Molecular sequences in extant taxa can be used to infer speciation and biogeographic history in deep time, as well as changes in population distributions produced by range shifts in shallow time, and thus provide a basis for constructing bridges between historical biogeographic, paleoecological and ecological biogeographic perspectives.

SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY

DT Article

AB Root hairs are specialized epidermal cells that are thought to play an important role in plant nutrition by facilitating the absorption of water and nutrients. Three maize mutants with abnormal root hair morphologies (rth1, rth2, and rth3) have been isolated from Mutator transposon stocks. All three root hair mutant phenotypes are controlled by single recessive alleles. The rth1 mutant initiates normal-looking root hair primordia that fail to elongate. The normal-looking root hair primordia of the rth2 mutant elongate to only approximately one-fifth to one-fourth the length of wild type root hairs. Like rth1 primordia, rth3 primordia undergo little elongation. However, unlike the relatively normal-looking rth1 primordia, rth3 primordia are distinctly abnormal when viewed through a scanning electron microscope. The rth1 mutant exhibits pleiotropic nutrient deficiencies, while the rth1 and rth3 mutants grow vigorously. This finding suggests that under some environmental conditions, root hairs are less important to plant growth than has been previously thought. The rth1, rth2, and rth3 genes have been mapped to chromosomes 1L, 5L, and 1S, respectively, via crosses with BA translocation stocks. The rth2 allele exhibits reduced transmission through the male gametophyte, but a normal rate of transmission through female gametophytes; rth1 and rth3 are transmitted at normal rates.

AB The feeding behavior of two of the most abundant species of leaf-eating mangrove crabs occurring in North Queensland (Sesarma messa and Sesarma smithii), was studied during the dry season of 1989. Laboratory feeding choice experiments showed that S. messa did not exhibit significant preference for any of the four species of newly fallen mangrove leaves offered, while consuming significantly more decayed than senescent leaves, irrespective of leaf species. S. smithii chose Rhizophora stylosa mangrove leaves over all other species (Avicennia marina, Bruguiera exaristata, Ceriops tagal). The choice of leaves by both crabs was not influenced by any of the leaf properties measured: tannin and water content, % of organic matter; C:N ratio; and leaf toughness. Crabs displayed no clear pattern of preferential consumption of different species of mangrove leaves in field experiments carried out in five separate forests. However, at all sites significantly greater amounts of C. tagal were found shredded and accumulated inside crab burrows compared to the other species of mangroves. Most of the litter accumulated by the crabs in their burrows was consumed within two weeks, before significant changes in the leaf C:N ratio occurred. The lesser selectivity observed in the field than in the laboratory might be the result of a shortage of food in the field during the dry season, when litter fall is minimum. The proportion of leaves shredded and accumulated in the burrows was significantly greater where S. smithii was present than at sites where only S. messa was found. S. smithii is rarely seen foraging on the forest floor and is active only at night. S. messa, in contrast, is frequently seen at the surface during day and night. I suggest that litter storage is a consequence of a time constraint to above ground activity for the nocturnal species rather than a mechanism for improving the nutritional characteristics of the food. The fresh mangrove litter most commonly consumed by crabs is characterised by a high C:N ratio and is not likely to meet the crabs' nitrogen requirements. Observations of the foraging activity of S. messa in the field, indicated that this species spends most of its feeding time scraping material from the mud surface. Bacteria and microalgae living in the upper layer of the sediment may be the principal source of nitrogen for mangrove crabs. Crabs spent a minor proportion of their time grazing on mangrove leaves and on the benthic algae covering the mangrove prop roots, with no significant preference for either one of these two substrates.

AB Increasing leaf transpiration efficiency (TE) may provide leads for growing rice like dryland cereals such as wheat (Triticum aestivum). To explore avenues for improving TE in rice, variations in stomatal conductance (g(s)) and mesophyll conductance (gm) and their anatomical determinants were evaluated in two cultivars from each of lowland, aerobic, and upland groups of Oryza sativa, one cultivar of O. glaberrima, and two cultivars of T. aestivum, under three water regimes. The TE of upland rice, O. glaberrima, and wheat was more responsive to the g(m)/g(s) ratio than that of lowland and aerobic rice. Overall, the explanatory power of the particular anatomical trait varied among species. Low stomatal density mostly explained the low gs in drought-tolerant rice, whereas rice genotypes with smaller stomata generally responded more strongly to drought. Compared with rice, wheat had a higher gm, which was associated with thicker mesophyll tissue, mesophyll and chloroplasts more exposed to intercellular spaces, and thinner cell walls. Upland rice, O. glaberrima, and wheat cultivars minimized the decrease in gm under drought by maintaining high ratios of chloroplasts to exposed mesophyll cell walls. Rice TE could be improved by increasing the g(m)/g(s) ratio via modifying anatomical traits.

AB Debates about environmental values and valuation are perplexing, in part because these terms are used in vastly different ways in a variety of contexts. For some, quantifying human and ecological values is promoted as a useful technical exercise that can support decision-making. Others spurn environmental valuation, equating it with reducing ethics to numbers or "putting a price tag on nature." We make sense of these complexities by distilling four fundamental concepts of value (and valuation) from across the literature. These four concepts-value as a magnitude of preference, value as contribution to a goal, values as individual priorities, and values as relations-entail fundamentally different approaches to environmental valuation. Two notions of values (as magnitudes of preference or contributions to a goal) are often operationalized in technical tools, including monetary valuation, in which experts tightly structure (and thus limit) citizen participation in decision-making. This kind of valuation, while useful in some contexts, can mask important societal choices as technical judgments. The concept of values as priorities provides a way of describing individuals' priorities and considering how these priorities differ across a wider population. Finally, the concept of values as relations is generally used to foster deliberative forms of civic participation, but this tends to leave unresolved the final translation of civic meanings for decision-makers. We argue that all forms of valuation-even those that are technical tools-constitute technologies of participation, and that values practitioners should consider themselves more as reflexive facilitators than objective experts who represent the public interest. We thus encourage debate about environmental values to pivot away from theoretical gridlock and toward a concern with citizen empowerment and environmental democracy.

AB Plant strategies to cope with future droughts may be enhanced by associations between roots and soil microorganisms, including arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi. But how AM fungi affect crop growth and yield, together with plant physiology and soil carbon (C) dynamics, under water stress in actual field conditions is not well understood. The well-characterized mycorrhizal tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) genotype 76R (referred to as MYC+) and the mutant nonmycorrhizal tomato genotype rmc were grown in an organic farm with a deficit irrigation regime and control regime that replaced evapotranspiration. AM increased marketable tomato yields by similar to 25% in both irrigation regimes but did not affect shoot biomass. In both irrigation regimes, MYC+ plants had higher plant nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) concentrations (e.g. 5 and 24% higher N and P concentrations in leaves at fruit set, respectively), 8% higher stomatal conductance (g(s)), 7% higher photosynthetic rates (P-n), and greater fruit set. Stem water potential and leaf relative water content were similar in both genotypes within each irrigation regime. Three-fold higher rates of root sap exudation in detopped MYC+ plants suggest greater capacity for water uptake through osmotic driven flow, especially in the deficit irrigation regime in which root sap exudation in rmc was nearly absent. Soil with MYC+ plants also had slightly higher soil extractable organic C and microbial biomass C at anthesis but no changes in soil CO2 emissions, although the latter were 23% lower under deficit irrigation. This study provides novel, field-based evidence for how indigenous AM fungi increase crop yield and crop water use efficiency during a season-long deficit irrigation and thus play an important role in coping with increasingly limited water availability in the future.

AB It is well known that the cooling effect of an urban green space extends into its surroundings, cooling the immediate environment and mitigating urban heat problems. However, the effects of size, shape, and type of an urban green space on cooling remain uncertain. The objectives of our study were to quantify and compare the strength of the cooling effects of urban parks and forests, to determine how far the cooling effects extend into the surrounding residential environment, and to better understand how temperature gradients are driven by physical characteristics of the green space and the surroundings. Mobile air temperature measurements were performed in 62 urban parks and forests in the city of Leipzig, Germany, in the summer of 2013. Three indicators of cooling were calculated: the change in temperature ( DT) at the park-width distance, the maximum DT, and the cooling distance. The relationships of these variables to the physical characteristics of the green spaces and their surroundings were examined in multiple regression models. Analyzing all three indicators revealed that cooling effects were greater in urban forests than in parks. Cooling increased with increasing size but in a different manner for forests and parks, whereas the influence of shape was the same for forests and parks. Generally, the characteristics of the green spaces were more important than the characteristics of the residential surroundings. These findings have the potential to assist in better planning and designing of urban green spaces to increase their cooling effects.

   MODELS; PREDICTION; HABITAT; RISK; PERFORMANCE; ABILITY
AB Human activities such as transport, trade and tourism are likely to influence the spatial distribution of non-native species and yet, Species Distribution Models (SDMs) that aim to predict the future broad scale distribution of invaders often rely on environmental (e.g. climatic) information only. This study investigates if and to what extent do human activities that directly or indirectly influence nature (hereafter the human footprint) affect the global distribution of invasive species in terrestrial, freshwater and marine ecosystems. We selected 72 species including terrestrial plants, terrestrial animals, freshwater and marine invasive species of concern in a focus area located in NW Europe (encompassing Great Britain, France, The Netherlands and Belgium). Species Distribution Models were calibrated with the global occurrence of species and a set of high-resolution (9x9 km) environmental (e.g. topography, climate, geology) layers and human footprint proxies (e.g. the human influence index, population density, road proximity). Our analyses suggest that the global occurrence of a wide range of invaders is primarily limited by climate. Temperature tolerance was the most important factor and explained on average 42% of species distribution. Nevertheless, factors related to the human footprint explained a substantial amount (23% on average) of species distributions. When global models were projected into the focus area, spatial predictions integrating the human footprint featured the highest cumulative risk scores close to transport networks (proxy for invasion pathways) and in habitats with a high human influence index (proxy for propagule pressure). We conclude that human related information-currently available in the form of easily accessible maps and databases-should be routinely implemented into predictive frameworks to inform upon policies to prevent and manage invasions. Otherwise we might be seriously underestimating the species and areas under highest risk of future invasions.

AB Background: The scalloped hammerhead shark, Sphyrna lewini, is a large endangered predator with a circumglobal distribution, observed in the open ocean but linked ontogenetically to coastal embayments for parturition and juvenile development. A previous survey of maternal (mtDNA) markers demonstrated strong genetic partitioning overall (global Phi(ST) = 0.749) and significant population separations across oceans and between discontinuous continental coastlines.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: We surveyed the same global range with increased sample coverage (N = 403) and 13 microsatellite loci to assess the male contribution to dispersal and population structure. Biparentally inherited microsatellites reveal low or absent genetic structure across ocean basins and global genetic differentiation (F-ST = 0.035) over an order of magnitude lower than the corresponding measures for maternal mtDNA lineages (Phi(ST) = 0.749). Nuclear allelic richness and heterozygosity are high throughout the Indo-Pacific, while genetic structure is low. In contrast, allelic diversity is low while population structure is higher for populations at the ends of the range in the West Atlantic and East Pacific.
   Conclusions/Significance: These data are consistent with the proposed Indo-Pacific center of origin for S. lewini, and indicate that females are philopatric or adhere to coastal habitats while males facilitate gene flow across oceanic expanses. This study includes the largest sampling effort and the most molecular loci ever used to survey the complete range of a large oceanic predator, and findings emphasize the importance of incorporating mixed-marker analysis into stock assessments of threatened and endangered shark species.

AB Disease is emerging as an important impact of global climate change, due to the effects of environmental change on host organisms and their pathogens. Climate-mediated disease can have severe consequences in natural systems, particularly when ecosystem engineers, such as habitat-formers or top predators are affected, as any impacts can cascade throughout entire food webs. In temperate marine ecosystems, seaweeds are the dominant habitat-formers on rocky reefs. We investigated a putative bleaching disease affecting Delisea pulchra, a chemically defended seaweed that occurs within a global warming 'hot-spot' and assessed how patterns of this phenomenon were influenced by ocean temperature, solar radiation, algal chemical defences and microbial pathogens. Warmer waters were consistently and positively correlated with higher frequencies of bleaching in seaweed populations, but patterns of bleaching were not consistently influenced by light levels. Bleached thalli had low levels of antibacterial chemical defences relative to healthy conspecifics and this was observed across entire thalli of partially bleached algae. Microbial communities associated with bleached algae were distinct from those on the surfaces of healthy seaweeds. Direct testing of the importance of algal chemical defences, done here for the first time in the field, demonstrated that they protected the seaweed from bleaching. Treatment of algal thalli with antibiotics reduced the severity of bleaching in experimental algae, especially at high water temperatures. These results indicate that bleaching in D. pulchra is the result of temperature-mediated bacterial infections and highlight the potential for warming to influence disease dynamics by stressing hosts. Understanding the complex ways in which global change may affect important organisms such as habitat-forming seaweeds, is essential for the management and conservation of natural resources.

TI Optimal timing for managed relocation of species faced with climate
   change
SO NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE
LA English
DT Article
ID ASSISTED COLONIZATION; RESPONSES; DEBATE; RISK
AB Managed relocation is a controversial climate-adaptation strategy to combat negative climate change impacts on biodiversity. While the scientific community debates the merits of managed relocation(1-12), species are already being moved to new areas predicted to be more suitable under climate change(13,14). To inform these moves, we construct a quantitative decision framework to evaluate the timing of relocation in the face of climate change. We find that the optimal timing depends on many factors, including the size of the population, the demographic costs of translocation and the expected carrying capacities over time in the source and destination habitats. In some settings, such as when a small population would benefit from time to grow before risking translocation losses, haste is ill advised. We also find that active adaptive management(15,16) is valuable when the effect of climate change on source habitat is uncertain, and leads to delayed movement.

AB Although the common carp (Cyprinus carpio), an invasive benthic fish from Eurasia, has long been strongly implicated in the disappearance of vegetative cover and reduced waterfowl abundance in North American shallow lakes, the details of this relationship are obscure. This study documented ecological changes in a recently restored shallow lake (Hennepin and Hopper Lakes, IL, USA) at a time that it was experiencing a large increase in its carp population. We estimated the abundance and biomass of carp 7 years after this lake had been restored and then back-calculated carp population size across time while examining changes in the lake's plant and waterfowl communities. We found that the biomass of carp remained below similar to 30 kg/ha for 5 years following restoration, but then increased to similar to 100 kg/ha in the sixth year following a strong recruitment event. Although a carp biomass of <30 kg/ha had no discernible effects on vegetative cover (which exceeded 90%) or waterfowl (which exceeded 150,000 individuals during fall censuses), the increase to 100 kg/ha was associated with a similar to 50% decrease in both vegetative cover and waterfowl. A further increase in carp biomass to over 250 kg/ha during the seventh year coincided with a decrease in the vegetative cover to 17% of the lake's surface and a decline in waterfowl use to similar to 10% of its original value. These data suggest that the common carp is extremely damaging to the ecological integrity of shallow lakes when its density exceeds similar to 100 kg/ha. Since the biomass of carp in Midwestern shallow lakes commonly exceeds this value by 3-4 times, it seems likely that carp are responsible for the large-scale habitat deterioration described in many of these ecosystems.

AB The negative effect of roads on wildlife is recognized as a major contributor to the global biodiversity crisis, with anurans being among the most vulnerable groups overall. The "road-effect zone," i.e., the extent of significant ecological effects from the edge of a road (Forman and Alexander 1998), has important management implications, but has never been quantified for anurans. In the first study of its kind, we measured the extent and type of relationship underlying the road-effect zones of a motorway with a high proportion of heavy-truck traffic, particularly at night (Highway 401) for anuran species richness and relative abundance. We surveyed 34 ponds located 68-3262 m from the edge of the motorway, and used piecewise and linear regressions to determine if road-effect zones were clearly delineated by ecological thresholds. We found road-effect zones of 250-1000 m delineated by ecological thresholds for four of seven species and species richness, and road-effect zones of well beyond 1000 m best described by linear regressions for two species. The negative effect of Highway 401 was unexpectedly strong for four of seven species suggest that, in addition to road mortality, very high nighttime truck traffic can actually lead to reduced use of breeding habitat near the motorway either by acting as a barrier to forest habitat on the other side of the highway and/or because of traffic noise. Our results show that most anurans are likely to have reduced abundances near motorways, but that both the extent of the effect of this type of road and the underlying relationship vary considerably between species. Furthermore, the noise and/ or barrier effect of very high nighttime traffic volumes can lead to negative effects of motorways even on species that are relatively unaffected by direct road mortality.

AB 1. Water stress may increase or reduce the suitability of plants for herbivores. The recently proposed 'pulsed stress hypothesis' suggests consideration of stress phenology (pulsed vs. continuous stress) to explain these conflicting effects of plant water stress on herbivore performance.
   2. This hypothesis was tested for the effect of differing stress intensity on performance and preference of insect herbivores belonging to different feeding guilds, namely leaf-chewing insects (Spodoptera littoralis caterpillars) and phloem-feeding insects (Aphis pomi aphids), on apple plants (Malus domestica). The plants were non-stressed or exposed to a low or high intensity of pulsed water stress.
   3. Plant responses to the different stress levels were generally monotonic. Growth, stomatal conductance (g(s)), leaf water, and old-leaf nitrogen concentration decreased, whereas young-leaf nitrogen concentration and leaf mass per area (LMA) increased with increasing stress intensity. The stable isotope composition of foliar carbon (delta C-13) responded non-monotonically to the drought treatments. The delta C-13 values were highest in low-stress plants, intermediate in high-stress plants, and lowest in non-stressed plants.
   4. The preference and performance responses of the caterpillars were also non-monotonic. Non-stressed plants were intermediately, low-stress plants least, and high-stress plants most attractive or suitable. Aphid population growth was highest on non-stressed plants and lowest on low-stress plants.
   5. The results highlight the importance of water stress intensity for the outcome of interactions between herbivores and drought-affected plants. They show that pulsed water stress may enhance or reduce insect herbivore performance and plant resistance, depending on stress intensity.

AB Traditional measures of biodiversity, such as species richness, usually treat species as being equal. As this is obviously not the case, measuring diversity in terms of features accumulated over evolutionary history provides additional value to theoretical and applied ecology. Several phylogenetic diversity indices exist, but their behaviour has not yet been tested in a comparative framework. We provide a test of ten commonly used phylogenetic diversity indices based on 40 simulated phylogenies of varying topology. We restrict our analysis to a topological fully resolved tree without information on branch lengths and species lists with presence-absence data. A total of 38,000 artificial communities varying in species richness covering 5-95% of the phylogenies were created by random resampling. The indices were evaluated based on their ability to meet a priori defined requirements. No index meets all requirements, but three indices turned out to be more suitable than others under particular conditions. Average taxonomic distinctness (AvTD) and intensive quadratic entropy (J) are calculated by averaging and are, therefore, unbiased by species richness while reflecting phylogeny per se well. However, averaging leads to the violation of set monotonicity, which requires that species extinction cannot increase the index. Total taxonomic distinctness (TTD) sums up distinctiveness values for particular species across the community. It is therefore strongly linked to species richness and reflects phylogeny per se weakly but satisfies set monotonicity. We suggest that AvTD and J are best applied to studies that compare spatially or temporally rather independent communities that potentially vary strongly in their phylogenetic composition-i.e. where set monotonicity is a more negligible issue, but independence of species richness is desired. In contrast, we suggest that TTD be used in studies that compare rather interdependent communities where changes occur more gradually by species extinction or introduction. Calculating AvTD or TTD, depending on the research question, in addition to species richness is strongly recommended.

AB Despite the importance of carnivores in terrestrial ecosystems, many nations have implemented well-coordinated, state:funded initiatives to remove predators, largely because of conflicts with humans over livestock. Although these control efforts have been successful in terms of the number of carnivores removed, their effects on the viability of the industries they seek to protect are less understood. I assessed the efficacy of long-term efforts by the US. government to improve the viability of the sheep industry by reducing predation losses. I used regression analysis and hierarchical partitioning of a 60-year data set to explore associations among changes in sheep numbers and factors such as predator control effort, market prices, and production costs. In addition, I compared trends in the sheep industry in the western United States, where predator control is subsidized and coyotes (Canis latrans) are abundant, with trends in eastern states that lack federally subsidized predator control and that were (1) colonized by coyotes before 1950 or (2) colonized by coyotes between 1950 and 1990. Although control efforts were positively correlated with fluctuations in sheep numbers, production costs and market prices explained most of the model variation, with a combined independent contribution of 77%. Trends in sheep numbers in eastern and western states were highly correlated (r >= 0.942) independent of the period during which they were colonized by coyotes, indicating either that control has been ineffective at reducing predation losses or that factors other than predation account for the declines in both regions. These results suggest that government-subsidizedpredator control has failed to prevent the decline in the sheep industry and alternative support mechanisms need to be developed if the goal is to increase sheep production and not simply to kill carnivores.

AB A number of parasitic plants have become weeds, posing severe constraints to major crops including grain legumes. Breeding for resistance is acknowledged as the major component of an integrated control strategy. However, resistance against most parasitic weeds is difficult to access, scarce, of complex nature and of low heritability, making breeding for resistance a difficult task. As an exception, resistance against Striga gesnerioides based on a single gene has been identified in cowpea and widely exploited in breeding. In other crops, only moderate to low levels of incomplete resistance of complex inheritance against Orobanche species has been identified. This has made selection more difficult and has slowed down the breeding process, but the quantitative resistance resulting from tedious selection procedures has resulted in the release of cultivars with useful levels of incomplete resistance. Resistance is a multicomponent event, being the result of a battery of escape factors or resistance mechanisms acting at different levels of the infection process. Understanding these will help to detect existing genetic diversity for mechanisms that hamper infection. The combination of different resistance mechanisms into a single cultivar will provide durable resistance in the field. This can be facilitated by the use of in vitro screening methods that allow highly heritable resistance components to be identified, together with adoption of marker-assisted selection techniques.

AB Genetic data can provide a powerful tool for those interested in the ecology and management of wildlife, especially when it is combined with behavioral, demographic, or spatial information. Although the full potential of genetic approaches to the Study of wildlife populations has yet to be realized, the application of genetic analyses is becoming increasingly feasible and cost-effective. This is due primarily to recent advances in the number and types of genetic markers available, the development of sophisticated data analysis methods, and increased automation of laboratory instrumentation. These technological advances have broadened the list of questions that can be answered with genetic data, allowing inference at multiple levels of resolution (inter-individual to inter-specific) and temporal and spatial scales. Genetic data can be used to assess mating systems, hybridization, gene flow, effective population size, and population viability. Genetic data can also be used to define management units; identify individuals, sex, and species; and to provide insights into demographic patterns associated with the reduction and expansion of populations. All of these factors are either related to a species' ecology or provide important information for management and conservation. We describe some applications of genetic data, discuss processes affecting genetic variation within and among populations, and provide an overview of genetic terminology and how genetic variation is measured. As genetic methods become progressively more accessible and adaptable to an ever-widening array of questions, it is expected that they will play an increasingly important role in the ecology and management of wildlife.

AB 1. Urbanisation is an important cause of eutrophication in waters draining urban areas. We determined whether benthic algal biomass in small streams draining urban areas was explained primarily by small-scale factors (benthic light, substratum type and nutrient concentrations) within a stream, or by catchment-scale variables that incorporate the interacting multiple impacts of urbanisation (i.e. variables that describe urban density and the intensity of drainage or septic tank systems).
   2. Benthic algal biomass was assessed as chlorophyll a density (chl a) in 16 streams spanning a rural-urban gradient, with both a wide range of urban density and of piped stormwater infrastructure intensity on the eastern fringe of metropolitan Melbourne, Australia. The gradient of urban density among streams was broadly correlated with catchment imperviousness, drainage connection (proportion of impervious areas connected to streams by stormwater pipes), altitude, longitude and median phosphorus concentration. Catchment area, septic tank density, median nitrogen concentration, benthic light (photosynthetically active radiation) and substratum type were not strongly correlated with the urban gradient.
   3. Variation in benthic light and substratum type within streams explained a relatively small amount of variation in log chl a (3-11 and 1-13%, respectively) compared with between-site variation (39-54%).
   4. Median chl a was positively correlated with catchment urbanisation, with a large proportion of variance explained jointly (as determined by hierarchical partitioning) by those variables correlated with urban density. Independent of this correlation, the contributions of drainage connection and altitude to the explained variance in chl a were significant.
   5. The direct connection of impervious surfaces to streams by stormwater pipes is hypothesised as the main determinant of algal biomass in these streams through its effect on the supply of phosphorus, possibly in interaction with stormwater-related impacts on grazing fauna. Management of benthic algal biomass in streams of urbanised catchments is likely to be most effective through the application of stormwater management approaches that reduce drainage connection.

AB Conservation seeks ultimately to protect and maintain biodiversity indefinitely. Most biodiversity features targeted in past conservation planning have been largely aspects of ecological and biogeographical pattern rather than process. However, the persistence of biodiversity can only be ensured through consideration of the ecological and evolutionary processes that underpin biodiversity, as well as its present spatial pattern. This paper identifies spatial surrogates of ecological and evolutionary processes for regional conservation planning in one of the world's biodiversity hotspots, the Cape Floristic Region. We identified six types of spatial components (namely edaphic interfaces, upland-lowland interfaces, sand movement corridors, riverine corridors, upland-lowland gradients and macroclimatic gradients) as surrogates for key processes such as ecological and geographical diversification, and species migration. Spatial components were identified in a GIS using published data and expert knowledge. Options for achieving targets for process components have been seriously compromised by habitat transformation. Between 30 and 75% of the original extent of the spatial components currently remain functional. Options for achieving upland-lowland and macroclimatic gradients are very limited in the lowlands where most of the habitat has been transformed by agriculture. We recommend that future studies place their research on ecological and evolutionary processes in a spatially explicit framework. Areas maintaining adaptive diversification (e.g. environmental gradients, ecotones) or containing historically isolated populations should be identified and protected. The spatial dimensions of eco-logical processes such as drought and fire refugia also need to be determined and such insights incorporated in conservation planning. Finally, connectivity within these areas should be ensured to maintain species migration and gene flow.

AB Group II introns comprise the majority of noncoding DNA in many plant chloroplast genomes and include the commonly sequenced regions trnK/matK, the rps16 intron, and the rpl16 intron. As demand increases for nucleotide characters at lower taxonomic levels, chloroplast introns may come to provide the bulk of plastome sequence data for assessment of evolutionary relationships in infrageneric, intergeneric, and interfamilial studies. Group II introns have many attractive properties for the molecular systematist: they are confined to organellar genomes in eukaryotes and the majority are single-copy; they share a well-defined and empirically tested secondary and tertiary structure; and many are easily amplified due to highly conserved sequence in flanking exons. However, structure-linked mutation patterns in group It intron sequences are more complex than generally supposed and have important implications for aligning nucleotides, assessing mutational biases in the data, and selecting appropriate models of character evolution for phylogenetic analysis. This paper presents a summary of group H intron function and structure, reviews the link between that structure and specific mutational constraints in group II intron sequences, and discusses strategies for accommodating the resulting complex mutational patterns in subsequent phylogenetic analyses.

   BACKGROUND SELECTION
AB We ask whether the observed mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) population subdivision of Drosophila simulans is indicative of organismal structure or of specific processes acting on the mitochondrial genome. Factors either intrinsic or extrinsic to the host genome may influence the evolutionary dynamics of mtDNA. Potential intrinsic factors include adaptation of the mitochondrial genome and of nucleomitochondrial gene complexes specific to the local environment, An extrinsic force that has been shown to influence mtDNA evolution in invertebrates is the bacterial endosymbiont Wolbachia. Evidence presented in this study suggests that mtDNA is not a good indicator of organismal subdivision in D. simulans. Furthermore, there is no evidence to suggest that Wolbachia causes any reduction in nuclear gene flow in this species. The observed differentiation in mtDNA is not corroborated by data from NADH: ubiquinone reductase 75kD subunit precursor or the Alcohol dehydrogenase-related loci, from the shape or size of the male genital arch, or from assortative premating behavior. We discuss these results in relation to a mitochondrial genetic species concept and the potential for Wolbachia-induced incompatibility to be a mechanism of speciation in insects. We conclude with an iterated appeal to include phylogenetic and statistical tests of neutrality as a supplement to phylogenetic and population genetic analyses when using mtDNA as an evolutionary marker.

TI Applying metapopulation theory to conservation of migratory birds
SO CONSERVATION BIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID BREEDING POPULATIONS; PHILOPATRY; HABITAT
AB Metapopulation theory has proven useful for understanding the population structure and dynamics of many species of conservation concern. The metapopulation concept has been applied almost exclusively to nonmigratory species, however, for which subpopulation demographic independence-a requirement for a classically defined metapopulation-is explicitly related to geographic distribution and dispersal probabilities. Defining the degree of demographic independence among subpopulations of migratory animals, and thus the applicability of metapopulation theory as a conceptual framework for understanding population dynamics, is much more difficult. Unlike nonmigratory species, subpopulations of migratory animals cannot be defined as synonymous with geographic areas. Groups of migratory birds that are geographically separate at one part of the annual cycle may occur together at others, but co-occurrence in time and space does not preclude the demographic independence of subpopulations. I suggest that metapopulation theory can be applied to migratory species but that understanding the degree of subpopulation independence may require information about both spatial distribution throughout the annual cycle and behavioral mechanisms that may lead to subpopulation demographic independence. The key for applying metapopulation theory to migratory animals lies in identifying demographically independent subpopulations, even as they move during the annual cycle and potentially co-occur with other subpopulations. Using examples of migratory bird species, I demonstrate that spatial and temporal modes of subpopulation independence can interact with behavioral mechanisms to create demographically independent subpopulations, including cases in which subpopulations are not spatially distinct in some parts of the annual cycle.

AB The population dynamics of two grasshoppers (Melanoplus femurrubrum and M. sanguinipes) were studied using experimental microcosms over 8 years at a Palouse prairie site in Montana. Grasshopper density, survival and reproduction in the experimental populations responded in a density-dependent fashion to natural and experimental changes in food availability for all grasshopper developmental stages, both within and between all years. We observed that field populations of the grasshoppers at the site exhibited density, survival and reproductive responses similar to the experimental populations over the period of the study. Because we could not identify any differences between the field and microcosm environments or the grasshopper individuals in them, we contend that field populations were ultimately limited by food within and between years. Density-dependent food limitation occurred for all age categories over the entire summer, because food abundance declined relative to grasshopper food requirements over the summer. Food limitation occurred between years, because in years with the lowest food abundance, the populations produced more hatchlings for the next year than could be supported by the highest observed food abundance. Finally, the observed annual changes in food abundance were correlated with the annual variation in weather (rainfall and temperature), which indicated that the long established relationship between grasshopper densities and weather conditions does not imply population limitation by density-independent processes.

AB Fire-driven succession and a period of high rainfall had a pronounced effect on the distribution and abundance of small mammals inhabiting spinifex grassland in Uluru National Park from 1987 to 1990. Species richness and abundance were generally higher on sites burnt in 1976, where six species (Pseudomys hermannsburgensis, Pseudomys desertor, Mus domesticus, Dasycercus cristicauda, Ningaui ridei and Sminthopsis youngsoni) were caught more frequently. Two species (Notomys alexis and Sminthopsis hirtipes) were more abundant on sites burnt in 1986. Murid rodent numbers fluctuated substantially following high rainfall. The number of individuals increased 100-fold, and species richness increased from two to four when P. desertor and M. domesticus appeared in the second year of the study. In contrast, captures of dasyurid marsupials increased only slightly over the three years, with the most dramatic increase occurring for D. cristicauda. This study highlights the importance of fire as a management tool. Patch burning within spinifex grasslands maximises species diversity of small mammals by ensuring that suitable successional states are present at all times. This is particularly important for species that are restricted in their distribution, such as D. cristicauda.

The following root parameters were studied:  root:shoot ratio, specific root length, specific root area, mean root diameter, frequency of fine roots, and the length and density of root hairs.  Significant between-species variation was found in all of these features.  Species from fertile sites had higher root:shoot ratios at high nitrogen supply than species from infertile habitats.  All species growing at low nitrogen supply showed a significant increase in root:shoot ratio.  Specific root length, specific root area, mean root diameter and frequency of fine roots were not affected significantly by nitrogen supply.  Species from infertile sites responded to low nitrogen supply by a significant increase in root hair length and root hair density.

AB One of the main questions in ecosystem restoration is where to obtain the seeds to re-establish plant communities. While the most commonly advocated approach is to use seeds from local sources, some experts argue against this because local populations may harbour little genetic variability for the restored populations to be able to adapt to and survive global change. Instead, they propose alternative strategies such as mixing seeds from various sources to increase genetic variability and adaptive potential, or using seeds from populations that have a similar climate as predicted for the target locality in the future. All these alternative seed-sourcing strategies have in common that they involve a transplanting of plant ecotypes, sometimes over large spatial scales. This is risky because plants from distant origins may be maladapted to the current local abiotic and biotic environment. In addition, introduction of non-local provenances will disrupt natural patterns of within-species biodiversity and will affect ecological networks, with unpredictable consequences. To balance the value of local adaptation with the need for future adaptation potential, we propose regional admixture provenancing' as a compromise strategy. Here seeds are sourced from multiple populations within the same region as the target locality and mixed prior to use. The mixing of seeds will increase the genetic diversity necessary for future adaptation, while restricting seed origins to a regional scale will maintain regional adaptation and reduce the risk of unintended effects on other biota. This approach is feasible in practice and has recently been implemented in Germany. We believe that it represents a compromise to reconcile opposing views on ecological restoration.

AB Intermittent rivers are increasingly viewed as shifting mosaics of lotic (flowing water), lentic (standing water) and terrestrial (dry riverbed) habitats. The diversity, spatial arrangement, temporal turnover and connectivity of these habitats are controlled by the magnitude, frequency, duration and extent of drying and rewetting events, which maintain habitat heterogeneity and control biodiversity and biogeochemical processes in intermittent rivers. We consider intermittent rivers as spatiotemporal landscape mosaics to identify the implications such a view has for empirical and theoretical developments in landscape and river ecology. Using observational data of flow states collected by citizen scientists along 1400km of river channels in western France, we used landscape metrics and ecologically scaled indices for four hypothetical, aquatic species (two fish and two insects) to describe the dynamics of intermittent river mosaics for five catchments. Dry patches dominated most observation dates but flowing patches had the longest average length and occupied the greatest proportion of channel length. At the start of each summer, catchments were almost entirely composed of flowing patches but lentic and dry patches could represented up to 80% of the catchments as summer progressed. Patch dynamics were typified by high levels of spatiotemporal variability. In contrast, ecologically scaled indices did not vary greatly among catchments within species. The ecologically scaled indices representing small fish were the most affected by habitat fragmentation. Such a landscape perspective could affect understanding of biodiversity patterns and biogeochemical processes in intermittent rivers. We outline the methodological developments required to integrate landscape approaches into intermittent river research, the associated challenges and current limitations in landscape ecology tools and models and the benefits of citizen science data sets. The continued quantification of shifting habitat mosaics in intermittent rivers will provide multiple opportunities to advance river and landscape ecology.

AB Projected global change will increase the level of land-use and environmental stressors such as drought and grazing, particularly in drylands. Still, combined effects of drought and grazing on plant production are poorly understood, thus hampering adequate projections and development of mitigation strategies. We used a large, cross-continental database consisting of 174 long-term datasets from >30 dryland regions to quantify ecosystem responses to drought and grazing with the ultimate goal to increase functional understanding in these responses. Two key aspects of ecosystem stability, resistance to and recovery after a drought, were evaluated based on standardized and normalized aboveground net primary production (ANPP) data. Drought intensity was quantified using the standardized precipitation index. We tested effects of drought intensity, grazing regime (grazed, ungrazed), biome (grassland, shrubland, savanna) or dominant life history (annual, perennial) of the herbaceous layer to assess the relative importance of these factors for ecosystem stability, and to identify predictable relationships between drought intensity and ecosystem resistance and recovery. We found that both components of ecosystem stability were better explained by dominant herbaceous life history than by biome. Increasing drought intensity (quasi-) linearly reduced ecosystem resistance. Even though annual and perennial systems showed the same response rate to increasing drought intensity, they differed in their general magnitude of resistance, with annual systems being ca. 27% less resistant. In contrast, systems with an herbaceous layer dominated by annuals had substantially higher postdrought recovery, particularly when grazed. Combined effects of drought and grazing were not merely additive but modulated by dominant life history of the herbaceous layer. To the best of our knowledge, our study established the first predictive, cross-continental model between drought intensity and drought-related relative losses in ANPP, and suggests that systems with an herbaceous layer dominated by annuals are more prone to ecosystem degradation under future global change regimes.

AB Human well-being is tightly linked to the natural environment. Although this notion is well-established, it remains difficult to assess how the biophysical features of a specific area contribute towards the well-being of the people attached to it We explore this topic using the case of four areas in Germany and Austria by performing open, single-question interviews with 262 respondents. Data reveal an outstanding relevance of nonmaterial values. Linkages between landscapes and human well-being are tied to specific features of the material environment but, likewise, practices and experiences play an important role in the creation and acknowledgment of such values. Our results accord with the conceptual outline of the cultural values model but fit to a lesser degree into the ecosystem services framework. Due to the high relevance of experiential factors, providing manifold opportunities for people to engage with their natural surroundings should be considered a strategy for fostering human well-being.

AB C-4 photosynthesis has higher light-use, nitrogen-use, and water-use efficiencies than C-3 photosynthesis. Historically, most of C-4 plants were classified into three subtypes (NADP-malic enzyme (ME), NAD-ME, or phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) subtypes) according to their major decarboxylation enzyme. However, a wealth of historic and recent data indicates that flexibility exists between different decarboxylation pathways in many C-4 species, and this flexibility might be controlled by developmental and environmental cues. This work used systems modelling to theoretically explore the significance of flexibility in decarboxylation mechanisms and transfer acids utilization. The results indicate that employing mixed C-4 pathways, either the NADP-ME type with the PEPCK type or the NAD-ME type with the PEPCK type, effectively decreases the need to maintain high concentrations and concentration gradients of transport metabolites. Further, maintaining a mixture of C-4 pathways robustly affords high photosynthetic efficiency under a broad range of light regimes. A pure PEPCK-type C-4 photosynthesis is not beneficial because the energy requirements in bundle sheath cells cannot be fulfilled due to them being shaded by mesophyll cells. Therefore, only two C-4 subtypes should be considered as distinct subtypes, the NADP-ME type and NAD-ME types, which both inherently involve a supplementary PEPCK cycle.

AB The potential impacts of underwater noise on marine mammals are widely recognised, but uncertainty over variability in baseline noise levels often constrains efforts to manage these impacts. This paper characterises natural and anthropogenic contributors to underwater noise at two sites in the Moray Firth Special Area of Conservation, an important marine mammal habitat that may be exposed to increased shipping activity from proposed offshore energy developments. We aimed to establish a pre-development baseline, and to develop ship noise monitoring methods using Automatic Identification System (AIS) and time-lapse video to record trends in noise levels and shipping activity. Our results detail the noise levels currently experienced by a locally protected bottlenose dolphin population, explore the relationship between broadband sound exposure levels and the indicators proposed in response to the EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive, and provide a ship noise assessment toolkit which can be applied in other coastal marine environments.

AB Because of the serious effects of pollution on water supply much closer attention has been paid to water quality than to other aspects of river integrity. However, channel form and water flow are relevant components of river health, and recent evidences show that their impairment threatens the services derived from them. In this article, we review the literature on the effects of common hydromorphological impacts (channel modification and flow modification) on the functioning of river ecosystems. There are evidences that even light hydromorphological impacts can have deep effects on ecosystem functioning, and that different functional variables differ in their responses. Three criteria (relevance, scale and sensitivity) in the selection of functional variables are suggested as a guide for the river scientists and managers to assess the ecological impacts of hydromorphological modifications.

AB Understanding space usage and resource selection is a primary focus of many studies of animal populations. Usually, such studies are based on location data obtained from telemetry, and resource selection functions (RSFs) are used for inference. Another important focus of wildlife research is estimation and modeling population size and density. Recently developed spatial capture-recapture (SCR) models accomplish this objective using individual encounter history data with auxiliary spatial information on location of capture. SCR models include encounter probability functions that are intuitively related to RSFs, but to date, no one has extended SCR models to allow for explicit inference about space usage and resource selection. In this paper we develop the first statistical framework for jointly modeling space usage, resource selection, and population density by integrating SCR data, such as from camera traps, mist-nets, or conventional catch traps, with resource selection data from telemetered individuals. We provide a framework for estimation based on marginal likelihood, wherein we estimate simultaneously the parameters of the SCR and RSF models. Our method leads to increases in precision for estimating parameters of ordinary SCR models. Importantly, we also find that SCR models alone can estimate parameters of RSFs and, as such, SCR methods can be used as the sole source for studying space-usage; however, precision will be higher when telemetry data are available. Finally, we find that SCR models using standard symmetric and stationary encounter probability models may not fully explain variation in encounter probability due to space usage, and therefore produce biased estimates of density when animal space usage is related to resource selection. Consequently, it is important that space usage be taken into consideration, if possible, in studies focused on estimating density using capture-recapture methods.

AB Natural capital and ecosystem service concepts are embodied in the ecosystems approach to sustainable development, which is a framework being consistently adopted by decision making bodies ranging from national governments to the United Nations. In the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment soils are given the vital role of a supporting service, but many of the other soil goods and services remain obscured. In this review we address this using and earth-system approach, highlighting the final goods and services soils produce, in a stock-fund, fund-service model of the pedosphere. We also argue that focusing on final goods and services will be counterproductive in the long run and emphasize that final goods and services are derived from an ecosystem supply chain that relies on ecological infrastructure. We propose that an appropriate ecosystems framework for soils should incorporate soil stocks (natural capital) showing their contribution to stock-flows and emergent fund-services as part of the supply chain. By so doing, an operational ecosystems concept for soils can draw on much more supporting data on soil stocks as demonstrated in a case study with soils data from England and Wales showing stocks, gaps in monitoring and drivers of change. Although the focus of this review is on soils, we believe the earth-system approach and principles of the ecosystem supply chain are widely applicable to the ecosystems approach and bring clarity in terms of where goods and services are derived from.

AB ANUCLIM (Xu and Hutchinson, 2011) is a unique software package used to support the spatial modelling and mapping of environmental and natural resources. It has been extensively employed for scientific research, teaching and policy making across study areas at various spatial scales. The package enables users to readily interrogate estimated values, in point and grid form, of monthly, seasonal and annual mean climate variables from supplied elevation dependent monthly mean climate surfaces and an underlying digital elevation model (DEM). The climate surfaces have been derived by the ANUSPLIN package (Hutchinson, 2004) and support interrogation at sub-kilometre scale. A key strength of the ANUCLIM package is its ability to generate bioclimatic profiles from known species locations to predict and map species distributions, in current, projected future and past climates. It can also generate a comprehensive set of climate parameters and growth indices for modelling growth of crops and plants. The package currently has four programs, MTHCLIM, BIOCLIM, BIOMAP and GROCLIM. MTHCLIM is used to obtain estimates of monthly mean climate variables from supplied climate surfaces at specified points or grids. BIOCLIM, in conjunction with BIOMAP, is a bioclimatic prediction system based on the bioclimatic envelope method devised by Nix (1986). GROCLIM is used to generate plant growth indices based on a simplified model of plant growth response to light, thermal and water regimes (Nix, 1981). The latest version of ANUCLIM, Version 6.1, incorporates substantial upgrades. In particular, the package now allows each of its four component programs to systematically incorporate the impacts of projected climate change. These projected climate changes can be provided either as simple constants, or more commonly, as grids of broad scale changes as obtained from outputs of General Circulation Models (GCMs) under various emission scenarios. For Australia, such grids can be obtained from the OzClim website of CSIRO (2007). This enables the systematic investigation of the impacts of projected climate change on socio-environmental systems.

AB Eradication aims at eliminating populations of alien organisms from an area. Since not all eradications are successful, several factors have been proposed in the literature (mainly by referring to case studies) to be crucial for eradication success, such as infestation size or reaction time. To our knowledge, however, no study has statistically evaluated which factors affect eradication success and attempted to determine their relative importance. We established a unique global dataset on 136 eradication campaigns against 75 species (invasive alien invertebrates, plants and plant pathogens) and statistically tested whether the following factors, proposed by others were significantly related to eradication success: (1) the reaction time between the arrival/detection of the organism and the start of the eradication campaign; (2) the spatial extent of the infestation; (3) the level of biological knowledge of the organism; and (4) insularity. Of these, only the spatial extent of the infestation was significantly related to the eradication outcome: local campaigns were more successful than regional or national campaigns. Reaction time, the level of knowledge and insularity were all unrelated to eradication success. Hence, some factors suggested as being crucial may be less important than previously thought, at least for the organisms tested here. We found no differences in success rates among taxonomic groups or geographic regions. We recommend that eradication measures should generally concentrate on the very early phase of invasions when infestations are still relatively small.

AB In some arid, semi-arid or Mediterranean climate regions, increased water extraction combined with climate change will prolong periods of drought in non-perennial streams, but the effects on macroinvertebrate populations are poorly understood. Drought refuges allow species to survive drying but their use depends on species' traits, and refuge availability depends on landscape structure. This review evaluates the utility of existing ecological concepts for predicting the role of drought refuges for sustaining biodiversity in non-perennial streams. We also suggest traits that may determine invertebrate species' resistance or resilience to prolonged drying. Parts of the likely responses by populations to increased stream drying are described by existing ecological concepts, such as the biological traits of species and their interaction with the habitat templet, barriers to dispersal and metapopulation dynamics, the use of drought refuges, habitat fragmentation and population and landscape genetics. However, the limited knowledge of invertebrate life histories in non-perennial streams restricts our ability to use these concepts in a predictive manner. In particular, reach or pool occupancy by species cannot be accurately predicted, but such predictions are necessary for evaluating potential management actions such as the use of environmental flows to sustain drought refuges during dry periods.

AB Mercury is a ubiquitous contaminant in aquatic ecosystems, posing a significant health risk to humans and wildlife that eat fish. Mercury accumulates in aquatic food webs as methylmercury (MeHg), a particularly toxic and persistent organic mercury compound. While mercury in the environment originates largely from anthropogenic activities, MeHg accumulation in freshwater aquatic food webs is not a simple function of local or regional mercury pollution inputs. Studies show that even sites with similar mercury inputs can produce fish with mercury concentrations ranging over an order of magnitude. While much of the foundational work to identify the drivers of variation in mercury accumulation has focused on freshwater lakes, mercury contamination in stream ecosystems is emerging as an important research area. Here, we review recent research on mercury accumulation in stream-dwelling organisms. Taking a hierarchical approach, we identify a suite of characteristics of individual consumers, food webs, streams, watersheds, and regions that are consistently associated with elevated MeHg concentrations in stream fish. We delineate a conceptual, mechanistic basis for explaining the ecological processes that underlie this vulnerability to MeHg. Key factors, including suppressed individual growth of consumers, low rates of primary and secondary production, hydrologic connection to methylation sites (e.g., wetlands), heavily forested catchments, and acidification are frequently associated with increased MeHg concentrations in fish across both streams and lakes. Hence, we propose that these interacting factors define a syndrome of characteristics that drive high MeHg production and bioaccumulation rates across these freshwater aquatic ecosystems. Finally, based on an understanding of the ecological drivers of MeHg accumulation, we identify situations when anthropogenic effects and management practices could significantly exacerbate or ameliorate MeHg accumulation in stream fish.

AB Broad-scale mapping of marine benthos is required for marine resource management and conservation. This study combines textural derivatives based on bathymetry from multibeam hydroacoustics with underwater video observations to model and map sessile biota between 10- and 60-m water depth over 35 km(2) in Point Addis Marine National Park (MNP), Vic., Australia. Classification tree models and maps were developed for macroalgae (all types, mixed red algae, Ecklonia, and rhodoliths) and sessile invertebrates (all types, sponges, and ascidians). Model accuracy was tested on 25% of the video observation dataset reserved from modelling. Models fit well for most macroalgae categories (correct classification rates of 67-84%), but are not as good for sessile invertebrate classes (correct classification rates of 57-62%). The poor fit of the sessile invertebrate models may be the combined result of grouping organisms with different environmental requirements and the effect of false absences recorded during video interpretation due to poor image quality. Probability maps, binary single-class maps, and multi-class maps supply spatially explicit, detailed information on the distribution of sessile benthic biota within the MNP and provide information at a landscape-scale for ecological investigations and marine management.

AB Common dolphins Delphinus sp. are frequently targeted by tourism operations in New Zealand waters, yet there is a paucity of data on potential impacts faced by this species. Transition matrix models, used widely in population ecology, have recently been applied to behavioural transitions in order to provide successful management guidelines. We detail the use of Markov chain models to assess the impact of tourism activities on the behavioural state of common dolphins in the Hauraki Gulf, New Zealand. First-order time discrete Markov chain models were used to describe transition probabilities in both control and impact scenarios. The effect of boat interactions was quantified by comparing transition probabilities of both control and impact chains. Foraging and resting bouts were significantly disrupted by boat interactions to a level that raises concern about the sustainability of this impact. Both the duration of bouts and the overall time spent in these 2 behavioural states decreased. Foraging dolphins took significantly longer to return to their initial behavioural state in the presence of the tour boat. There was also an increased preference to shift behaviour to socialising or milling after tour boat interactions. Impacts identified in the present study are similar to those previously reported for bottlenose dolphins, a coastal species typically considered to be more susceptible to cumulative anthropogenic impacts.

AB We examined the dynamics of organic nitrogen (N) turnover in situ across a primary successional sequence in interior Alaska, USA, in an attempt to understand the magnitude of these fluxes in cold, seasonally frozen soils. Through a combination of soil extraction procedures and measurements of C-13-enriched CO2 efflux from soils amended in the field with C-13-labeled amino acids, we were able to trace the fate of this N form. Amino acid turnover in situ at soil temperatures of 10 degrees C or below show that amino acids represent a highly dynamic soil N pool with turnover times of approximately 3-6 h. The rapid turnover of free amino acids is associated with high soil proteolytic activity, which in turn is tightly correlated with soil protein concentration. Moreover, these estimates of soil amino acid turnover in the field correspond well with measurements of amino acid turnover under equivalent temperatures in the laboratory. The gross flux of amino acid-N over the growing season greatly exceeded the annual vegetation N requirement, suggesting that microbial biomass represent a significant sink for this organic N. Depending on the strength of this sink, N flow via free soil amino acids can potentially account for the entire N demand of vegetation in the absence of net N mineralization. These relationships underscore the important biogeochemical role of labile DON fractions in high-latitude forest ecosystems.

AB Rice (Oryza sativa L.) plants with substantially increased Rubisco content were obtained by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation with the rice rbcS sense gene under the control of the rice rbcS promoter. The primary transformants were screened for the ratio of Rubisco to leaf-N content, and the transformants with > 120% wild-type levels of Rubisco were selected. In the progeny of the selected lines of the transformants, the mRNA levels of one member of the rbcS gene family were increased from 3.9- to 6.2-fold, whereas those of other members of the rbcS gene family were unchanged. The total levels of rbcS mRNA were increased from 2.1- to 2.8-fold. The levels of rbcL mRNA were increased from 1.2- to 1.9-fold. Rubisco protein content was significantly increased by 30% on a leaf area basis. The ratio of Rubisco-N to leaf-N was also increased by 10-20%, irrespective of N treatment. The specific activity of Rubisco per unit of enzyme protein was not different. However, light-saturated photosynthesis was not enhanced even when the rate was measured at low [CO2] where Rubisco becomes limiting for photosynthesis. Some lines showed lower photosynthesis at high [CO2] (> 60 Pa). We conclude that introduction of additional sense rbcS leads to overexpression of rbcS and that this overexpression slightly up-regulates the gene expression of rbcL at the transcript level and enhances the amount of Rubisco holoenzyme. However, overproduction of Rubisco protein does not improve photosynthesis.

AB Habitat fragmentation may severely affect survival of social insect populations as the number of nests per population, not the number of individuals, represents population size, hence they may be particularly prone to loss of genetic diversity. Erosion of genetic diversity may be particularly significant among social Hymenoptera such as bumblebees (Bombus spp.), as this group may be susceptible to diploid male production, a suggested direct cost of inbreeding. Here, for the first time, we assess genetic diversity and population structuring of a threatened bumblebee species (Bombus sylvarum) which exists in highly fragmented habitat (rather than oceanic) islands. Effective population sizes, estimated from identified sisterhoods, were very low (range 21-72) suggesting that isolated populations will be vulnerable to loss of genetic variation through drift. Evidence of significant genetic structuring between populations (theta = 0.084) was found, but evidence of a bottleneck was detected in only one population. Comparison across highly fragmented UK populations and a continental population (where this species is more widespread) revealed significant differences in allelic richness attributable to a high degree of genetic diversity in the continental population. While not directly related to population size, this is perhaps explained by the high degree of isolation between UK populations relative to continental populations. We suggest that populations now existing on isolated habitat islands were probably linked by stepping-stone populations prior to recent habitat loss.

AB Genetic surveys of reef fishes have revealed high population connectivity within ocean basins, consistent with the assumption that pelagic larvae disperse long distances by oceanic currents. However, several recent studies have demonstrated that larval retention and self-recruitment may be higher than previously expected. To assess connectivity in tropical reef fishes, we contribute range-wide mtDNA surveys of two Atlantic squirrelfishes (family Holocentridae). The blackbar soldierfish, Myripristis jacobus, has a pelagic juvenile phase of about 58 days, compared to about 71 days (similar to 22% longer) in the longjaw squirrelfish, Holocentrus ascensionis. If the pelagic duration is guiding dispersal ability, M. jacobus should have greater population genetic structure than H. ascensionis. In comparisons of mtDNA cytochrome b sequences from 69 M. jacobus (744 bp) and 101 H. ascensionis (769 bp), both species exhibited a large number of closely related haplotypes (h=0.781 and 0.974, pi=0.003 and 0.006, respectively), indicating late Pleistocene coalescence of mtDNA lineages. Contrary to the prediction based on pelagic duration, M. jacobus has much less population structure (phi(ST)=0.008, P=0.228) than H. ascensionis (phi(ST)=0.091, P < 0.001). Significant population partitions in H. ascensionis were observed between eastern, central and western Atlantic, and between Brazil and the Caribbean in the western Atlantic. These results, in combination with the findings from 13 codistributed species, indicate that pelagic larval duration is a poor predictor of population genetic structure in Atlantic reef fishes. A key to understanding this disparity may be the evolutionary depth among corresponding taxonomic groups of "reef fishes", which extends back to the mid-Cretaceous and encompasses enormous diversity in ecology and life history. We should not expect a simple relationship between pelagic larval duration and genetic connectivity, among lineages that diverged 50-100 million years ago.

AB In recent years alternative modeling techniques have been used to account for spatial autocorrelations among data observations. They include linear mixed model (LMM), generalized additive model (GAM), multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural network, radial basis function (RBF) neural network, and geographically weighted regression (GWR). Previous studies show these models are robust to the violation of model assumptions and flexible to nonlinear relationships among variables. However, many of them are non-spatial in nature. In this study, we utilize a local spatial analysis method (i.e., local Moran coefficient) to investigate spatial distribution and heterogeneity in model residuals from those modeling techniques with ordinary least-squares (OLS) as the benchmark. The regression model used in this study has tree crown area as the response variable, and tree diameter and the coordinates of tree locations as the predictor variables. The results indicate that LMM, GAM, MLP and RBF may improve model fitting to the data and provide better predictions for the response variable, but they generate spatial patterns for model residuals similar to OLS. The OLS, LMM, GAM, MLP and RBF models yield more residual clusters of similar values, indicating that trees in some sub-areas are either all underestimated or all overestimated for the response variable. In contrast, GWR estimates model coefficients at each location in the study area, and produces more accurate predictions for the response variable. Furthermore, the residuals of the GWR model have more desirable spatial distributions than the ones derived from the OLS, LMM, GAM, MLP and RBF models. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB To test the hypothesis that different species have similar responses to local and regional environmental constraints, we modelled the occurrences of 13 species using a data set of 413 undisturbed river reaches. Three environmental descriptors were considered at the local scale (river slope, river width, and upstream drainage area) and three at the regional scale (mean annual and mean range air temperature and basin unit). Using multiple logistic regression modelling techniques, we correctly predicted the occurrence of 11 of the 13 retained species. The hierarchical partitioning analysis that we used allowed us to jointly consider all possible models in a multiple regression setting and to evaluate the independent explanatory power of each of our five environmental variables. We reject the hypothesis of a common species response to the environmental constraints. Species inhabiting upstream river reaches (bullhead (Cottus gobio), brown trout (Salmo trutta), minnow (Phoxinus phoxinus), and stone loach (Barbatula barbatula)) are more sensitive to basin unit. All species representative of downstream areas (barbel (Barbus barbus), dace (Leuciscus leuciscus), chub (Leuciscus cephalus), gudgeon (Gobio gobio), roach (Rutilus rutilus), bleak (Alburnus alburnus), and perch (Perca fluviatilis)) exhibit a positive continuous response to the drainage area, in agreement with the view of a continuous increase of local richness downstream. River slope is an important variable for all species. Main species habitat requirements are discussed for each species.

AB Hydrological disturbances, usually floods and drying, govern the distribution and abundance of biota and ecological processes in freshwater ecosystems. Reducing hydrological variability should reduce biodiversity and affect ecological processes. Many of Australia's rivers have reduced variability with river regulation, but some remain free flowing. We tested the variability hypothesis using waterbird communities on 12 floodplain lakes, paired into six systems distributed across half of the continent, over the period from 1983 to 2001. Half of the floodplain lakes were regulated (reservoirs) with stable water levels, while the remainder had unaltered hydrology. We analyzed in more detail the waterbird community within the Menindee system, using eight floodplain lakes, paired into four groups of flow regimes. Similar but less marked patterns occurred within the Menindee system. Overall, mean density (+/-1 SE) on unregulated floodplain lakes was significantly higher (6.04 +/- 1.64 waterbirds/ha), compared with regulated floodplain lakes (0.66 +/- 0.22 waterbirds/ha). The mean number of species on floodplain lakes was significantly higher on unregulated lakes ( 17.21 +/- 0.95, n = 19), compared with regulated floodplain lakes (9.32 +/- 0.56, n = 19). Numbers of waterbird species were significantly higher on unregulated lakes compared with regulated lakes, reaching a higher mean accumulation value over time. High diversity was observed in three of the five functional feeding groups that feed on invertebrate populations and aquatic vegetation. The other two feeding groups (piscivores and large wading species) were similar in number and density between regulated and unregulated lakes, possibly because exotic fish species thrived in regulated lakes. Ordination analyses supported these observations, clearly separating unregulated lakes and flow-regulated lakes. Reduction of hydrological variability, particularly removal of natural drying periods, affected the ecology of regulated floodplain lakes. High waterbird biodiversity requires natural flooding and drying disturbance on lowland rivers, where extensive floods are punctuated by drying periods.

AB Fish assemblages in the Mimiwhangata Marine Park, an area closed to commercial fishing but open to most forms of recreational fishing, were compared with adjacent fished areas. Two survey methodologies were used; baited underwater video and underwater visual census. Snapper (Pagrus auratus), the most heavily targeted fish species in the region, showed no difference in abundance or size between the Marine Park and adjacent control areas. When compared to the fully no-take Poor Knights Island Marine Reserve and two other reference areas open to all kinds of fishing (Cape Brett and the Mokohinau Islands), the abundance and size of snapper at the Marine Park were most similar to fished reference areas. In fact, the Marine Park had the lowest mean numbers and sizes of snapper of all areas, no-take or open to fishing. Baited underwater video found that pigfish (Bodianus unimaculatus), leatherjackets (Parika scaber) and trevally (Pseudocaranx dentex) were significantly more common in the Marine Park, than in the adjacent control areas. However, none of these species are heavily targeted by fishers. Underwater visual census found similar results with five species significantly more abundant in the Marine Park and five species more abundant outside the Marine Park. The lack of any recovery by snapper within the Marine Park, despite the exclusion of commercial fishers and restrictions on recreational fishing, indicates that partial closures are ineffective as conservation tools. The data suggest fishing pressure within the Marine Park is at least as high as at other 'fished' sites. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB How big an animal group will be depends on how the group's size is regulated and on the costs and benefits of living in the group. To determine which individuals regulate group size of the clown anemonefish, Amphiprion percula, I investigated the strategies involved in the formation, maintenance, and dissolution of its groups. Groups composed of a single breeding pair and of zero to four nonbreeding subordinates occupied individual sea anemones (Heteractis magnifica), which provided the fish with oviposition sites and protection from predators. Group size increased linearly with anemone size. I used the residuals of this relationship as a measure of the degree of saturation of each anemone. Residents evicted low-rank subordinates and prevented the recruitment of additional subordinates at anemones with a high degree of saturation, but not at anemones with a low degree of saturation. These strategies indicate that residents control group membership of their subordinates, and suggest that residents might incur costs from the presence of subordinates in more saturated anemones. In general, whenever residents can control group membership, the prevention of recruitment and the eviction of subordinates will set an upper limit on group size.

AB Rapid environmental changes have fostered debates and motivated research on how to effectively preserve or restore ecosystem processes. One such debate deals with the effects of biodiversity, and the loss thereof, on ecosystem processes. Recent studies demonstrate that resource-use complementarity, now known as the "niche-differentiation effect," and the presence of a competitive species with strong effects on ecosystem processes, now known as the "sampling effect," can explain why productivity and nutrient retention are sometimes enhanced with increasing species richness. In a well-replicated outdoor mesocosm experiment, we tested these and other alternative mechanisms that could explain the effects of submersed aquatic plant (macrophyte) diversity on wetland ecosystem processes. Algal biomass increased and phosphorus loss decreased as species richness increased. This result can best be explained by an indirect sampling effect caused by one of the weakest competitors, which appeared to facilitate algal growth and thereby filtering of particles, and thus phosphorus, from the water column. The dominant competitor also appeared to decrease phosphorus loss through direct effects on phosphorus availability in the soil and water. Thus, the effects by one of the weakest and the most dominant competitors combine to produce a diversity effect on phosphorus loss. Macrophyte biomass was not enhanced, but converged toward the intermediate biomass of the most competitive species. Such an "inverse sampling effect" may be produced when the most competitive species is not the most productive species owing to species-specific feedbacks and adaptations to the wetland environment. In summary, we reject the niche-differentiation effect as the dominant mechanism in our macrophyte communities and expand on the role of sampling effects in explaining the relationship between plant communities and ecosystem processes. In particular, indirect and inverse sampling effects combine to drive the relationship between species richness and wetland ecosystem processes. Thus, we demonstrate that plant diversity may affect wetland ecosystem processes when inferior competitors drive system productivity and nutrient retention. To ensure coexistence of such species with superior competitors, wetland systems may need to be maintained in a nonequilibrium state, such as with hydrologic disturbances, which would maintain both higher diversity and enhance ecosystem functioning.

AB Aim To predict French Scarabaeidae dung beetle species richness distribution, and to determine the possible underlying causal factors.
   Location The entire French territory has been studied by dividing it into 301 grid cells of 0.72 x 0.36 degrees.
   Method Species richness distribution was predicted using generalized linear models to relate the number of species with spatial, topographic and climate variables in grid squares previously identified as well sampled (n = 66). The predictive function includes the curvilinear relationship between variables, interaction terms and the significant third-degree polynomial terms of latitude and longitude. The final model was validated by a jack-knife procedure. The underlying causal factors were investigated by partial regression analysis, decomposing the variation in species richness among spatial, topographic and climate type variables.
   Results The final model accounts for 86.2% of total deviance, with a mean jack-knife predictive error of 17.7%. The species richness map obtained highlights the Mediterranean as the region richest in species, and the less well-explored south-western region as also being species-rich. The largest fraction of variability (38%) in the number of species is accounted for by the combined effect of the three groups of explanatory variables. The spatially structured climate component explains 21% of variation, while the pure climate and pure spatial components explain 14% and 11%, respectively. The effect of topography was negligible.
   Conclusions Delimiting the adequately inventoried areas and elaborating forecasting models using simple environmental variables can rapidly produce an estimate of the species richness distribution. Scarabaeidae species richness distribution seems to be mainly influenced by temperature. Minimum mean temperature is the most influential variable on a local scale, while maximum and mean temperature are the most important spatially structured variables. We suggest that species richness variation is mainly conditioned by the failure of many species to go beyond determined temperature range limits.

AB Female multiple mating (or polyandry) is considered to act as a genetic bet-hedging mechanism, by which females can reduce the assessment error in regard to mates' genetic quality when only uncertain information is available. In spite of frequent verbal arguments, no theoretical examination has been carried out to determine the effectiveness of bet-hedging by multiple mating. In the present paper, I show that three factors, female population size, remating costs and environmental fluctuation, all affect the effectiveness of bet-hedging. A mathematical model predicts that bet-hedging effectively works only in small populations, and computer simulations were used to confirm this prediction. The results of simulations differed according to the degree of environmental fluctuation. In relatively stable environments, if there is no remating cost, the fixation probability of a multiple mating strategy is slightly higher than that of a single mating strategy, independent of female population size. However, with very slight fitness costs, multiple mating drastically loses its advantage as population size increases, and almost always becomes extinct within large populations. This means that the evolution of polyandry solely by the mechanism of bet-hedging is unlikely in stable environments. However, in unpredictable environments, or when negative frequency-dependent selection on fitness-related loci is introduced, a multiple mating strategy is sometimes successful against a single mating strategy, even if it entails a small fitness cost. Therefore, female multiple mating may possibly evolve only in these limited conditions. In most cases, some deterministic mechanisms such as postcopulatory sperm selection by multiply mated females (or direct 'material' benefits) are more reasonable as the evolutionary causes of polyandry.

AB A simple food chain model of community structure was used to evaluate the roles of bottom-up and top-down factors in a rocky intertidal community. Predictions of the model were modified to incorporate known variation in the strength of species interactions and nutrient delivery rates along a wave-exposure gradient. To test the predictions of the model, I manipulated nutrients and consumers in tide pools chiseled into mudstone benches at two sites that varied in degree of wave exposure. The pools were located in the mid-intertidal zone between similar to1 and 1.5 m above mean lower low water (MLLW), at Boiler Bay, Oregon, USA. The focal organisms were the benthic macroalgae acid mobile invertebrate herbivores that dominate naturally occurring tide pools at this site.
   I manipulated nutrient levels and the abundance of herbivores in these tide pools in a fully factorial randomized block design replicated six times at a wave-exposed and a wave-protected site. The experiment was maintained for two years (1994-1996). The abundances of herbivores and macroalgae were monitored in the spring, summer, and fall of each year. I measured primary productivity in the tide pools during the summer.
   Herbivores had a negative impact on algal abundance. The total effect of herbivory, and the efficiency of herbivores per se, on algal abundance was lower at the wave-exposed site. Nutrient additions had a positive effect on algal abundance, but this effect was reduced at the wave-exposed site. Nutrients also appeared to increase algal productivity, but only where herbivore abundance was low. Algal abundance patterns were generally consistent with model predictions For bottom-up, top-down, and hydrodynamic effects. In contrast to model predictions, herbivore abundance did not respond to the nutrient treatment.
   The decoupling of consumers from resource dynamics is interpreted to be the result of an herbivore preference for noncalcified seaweeds with higher potential growth rates. In wave-protected pools, where nutrients were most limiting and consumers were most efficient, seaweeds with the potential to translate elevated nutrient levels into growth had no effective refuge from consumers. The difference in scale between resource patches (tide pools) and the foraging range of the dominant herbivore, Tegula funebralis, may have augmented the ability of this herbivore to virtually exclude fleshy seaweeds from wave-protected pools. Expanding the domain of applicability of food chain models requires the incorporation of consumer preferences, variation in plant growth rates, environmental gradients, and differences in the relative scales of resource patches and Foraging ranges of consumers.

AB Mitochondrial D-loop hypervariable region I (HVI) sequences are widely used in human molecular evolutionary studies, and therefore accurate assessment of rate heterogeneity among sites is essential. We used the maximum-likelihood method to estimate the gamma shape parameter alpha for variable substitution rates among sites for HVI from humans and chimpanzees to provide estimates for future studies. The complete data of 839 humans and 224 chimpanzees, as well as many subsets of these data, were analyzed to examine the effect of sequence sampling. The effects of the genealogical tree and the nucleotide substitution model were also examined. The transition/ transversion rate ratio (kappa) is estimated to be about 25, although much larger and biased estimates were also obtained from small data sets at low divergences. Estimates of alpha were 0.28-0.39 for human data sets of different sizes and 0.20-0.39 for data sets including different chimpanzee subspecies. The combined data set of both species gave estimates of 0.42-0.45. While all those estimates suggest highly variable substitution rates among sites, smaller samples tend to give smaller estimates of alpha. Possible causes for this pattern were examined, such as biases in the estimation procedure and shifts in the rate distribution along certain lineages. Computer simulations suggest that the estimation procedure is quite reliable for large trees but can be biased for small samples at low divergences. Thus, an alpha of 0.4 appears suitable for both humans and chimpanzees. Estimates of alpha can be affected by the nucleotide sites included in the data, the overall tree length (the amount of sequence divergence), the number of rate classes used for the estimation, and to a lesser extent, the included sequences. The genealogical tree, the substitution model, and demographic processes such as population expansion do not have much effect.

AB Fluorescent elastomer injection was used to mark newly settled Hawaiian coral reef fishes (8-56 mm SL) in the laboratory and in the field. Marking success was influenced by depth of subcutaneous tag injection, anatomical location of the tag, pigmentation of the skin at that location, and investigator's experience with the technique. Visibility up to several months and little mortality was achieved with careful handling of the fish and skillful placement of the injection. In the laboratory, mortality related to marking occurred within 24 h of the procedure. Within this time, one mortality was observed for fish > 20 mm SL; fish < 20 mm SL experienced 13% mortality. Fish marked and held in the laboratory showed 100%, tag visibility and retention for observation periods up to 76 d. Of 286 fish marked, released and tracked in the field, 67% were regularly resighted for observation periods up to 130 d. Of 59 fish observed in the field for at least 45 d, 36% were resighted; four were resighted at least 100 d after marking. Visibility of one tag was reduced over the first 30 d by growth of surrounding tissue. Because of small tag size and the large number of unique combinations of tag color and injection location, field identification of individuals was possible. Success in recognizing individually marked fish in the field required some observer experience. Although not necessary in this study, under low visibility conditions, resighting success could be enhanced with the use of UV-A filtered light.

AB Reef habitats in the South Atlantic Eight comprise only a small proportion of the available benthic habitat, but support enormous densities of fishes, invertebrates, and algae. Because these reefs are distant from shore and in deeper waters (usually >20 m), we know very little about the factors affecting the distribution of fishes or the structure of fish assemblages on these reefs. Our goal in this study was to determine how variance in macroalgal structure and species composition on reefs off the coast of North Carolina affects reef fishes. Manipulations of algal density and species composition in artificially created 1.5 m(2) plots indicated that: (1) patches with Sargassum filipendula had greater numbers and higher species richness of reef fishes than patches without algae; (2) fishes responded to variability in Sargassum density with high fish abundance in patches with higher algal density, but this response varied among fish species; (3) greater numbers of individuals and species of fish used Sargassum patches compared to patches of 2 other brown algae common in this region (Zonaria and Dictyopteris); (4) fish densities were higher in patches with taller algae and greater percent cover of algae. Many of the fishes using experimental patches were small, young-of-the-year individuals. Our results indicate that variability in the structure of seaweed beds on reefs in the South Atlantic Eight can influence the distribution and abundance of reef fishes. Although the algal beds in the South Atlantic Eight are more diminutive and less extensive than kelp beds of cold temperate waters, they may be a critical habitat for juvenile reef fishes in this region, and the algal species dominating the beds will have a large effect on their value as juvenile habitat.

AB A combination of larval behavior and physical factors influence the spatial patterns of settlement of marine organisms. Of particular importance to the settlement process is the blend of passive transport and active responses to water flow near the settlement habitat. Field experiments with the naked goby Gobiosoma bose, a benthic oyster reef fish, indicated that larvae aggregate in low-flow areas on the downcurrent sides of rocks, and shift position with changing flow directions. Larger aggregations of larvae were found in downcurrent positions at rocks that created larger low-flow zones, and during parts of the tidal cycle with higher ambient flow velocities. Settlement occurred in a highly aggregated pattern that reflected larval distributions, Most settlement measured in a field experiment was adjacent to downcurrent sides of rocks rather than in other positions near rocks, or away from structures that would decrease downcurrent now velocities. These results suggest that the active response of fish larvae to either direct or indirect effects of now on reefs may be important to fine-scale spatial patterns of settlement. Because zooplankton densities downcurrent of rocks were similar to, or lower than, densities upcurrent and lateral to rocks, spatial distributions of prey are unlikely to explain larval distributions. Instead, active preference for low-flow areas may enable fish larvae to maintain their position on oyster reefs, the preferred settlement habitat.

AB During recent decades, the Tuckahoe Creek (Virginia) watershed has been altered by human activities, including road and bridge construction, commercial and residential development, and riparian losses. We used historical (1958) and recent (1990) data to evaluate the hypothesis that long-term, low-intensity urbanization affects a warmwater stream fish assemblage in ways usually attributed to acute, high-intensity perturbations. In 1990, fish species diversity of Tuckahoe Creek was significantly lower (P < 0.05) than it had been in 1958, and abundance was substantially lower for all species and trophic guilds. Four cyprinids, one ictalurid, and one percid present in 1958 were not collected in 1990. Jaccard's community similarity coefficient (species composition by site between 1958 and 1990) was negatively correlated with near-stream development of the watershed at six study sites (r = -0.84; P < 0.05). Some characteristics of the feeding ecology of selected fish species, including consumption of terrestrial prey and diet overlap, exhibited slight differences between 1958 and 1990. Observed changes in the fish assemblage were consistent with our hypothesis. Our findings also suggest that the lack of invasions by exotic fishes may not always indicate undisturbed stream conditions.

AB How coral reefs survive as oases of life in low-productivity oceans has puzzled scientists for centuries. The answer may lie in internal nutrient cycling and/or input from the pelagic zone. Integrating meta-analysis, field data, and population modeling, we show that the ocean's smallest vertebrates, cryptobenthic reef fishes, promote internal reef fish biomass production through extensive larval supply from the pelagic environment. Specifically, cryptobenthics account for two-thirds of reef fish larvae in the near-reef pelagic zone despite limited adult reproductive outputs. This overwhelming abundance of cryptobenthic larvae fuels reef trophodynamics via rapid growth and extreme mortality, producing almost 60% of consumed reef fish biomass. Although cryptobenthics are often overlooked, their distinctive demographic dynamics may make them a cornerstone of ecosystem functioning on modern coral reefs.

AB Plant invasion is an emerging driver of global change worldwide. We aimed to disentangle its impacts on plant-soil nutrient concentrations. We conducted a meta-analysis of 215 peer-reviewed articles and 1233 observations. Invasive plant species had globally higher N and P concentrations in photosynthetic tissues but not in foliar litter, in comparison with their native competitors. Invasive plants were also associated with higher soil C and N stocks and N, P, and K availabilities. The differences in N and P concentrations in photosynthetic tissues and in soil total C and N, soil N, P, and K availabilities between invasive and native species decreased when the environment was richer in nutrient resources. The results thus suggested higher nutrient resorption efficiencies in invasive than in native species in nutrient-poor environments. There were differences in soil total N concentrations but not in total P concentrations, indicating that the differences associated to invasive plants were related with biological processes, not with geochemical processes. The results suggest that invasiveness is not only a driver of changes in ecosystem species composition but that it is also associated with significant changes in plant-soil elemental composition and stoichiometry.

AB Due to the different degrees of controls exerted by biological and geochemical processes, climate changes are suggested to uncouple biogeochemical C, N and P cycles, influencing biomass accumulation, decomposition and storage in terrestrial ecosystems. However, the possible extent of such disruption in grassland ecosystems remains unclear, especially in China's steppes which have undergone rapid climate changes with increasing drought and warming predicted moving forward in these dryland ecosystems. Here, we assess how soil C-N-P stoichiometry is affected by climatic change along a 3500-km temperate climate transect in Inner Mongolia, China. Our results reveal that the soil from more arid and warmer sites are associated with lower soil organic C, total N and P. The ratios of both soil C: P and N: P decrease, but soil C: N increases with increasing aridity and temperature, indicating the predicted decreases in precipitation and warming for most of the temperate grassland region could lead to a soil C-N-P decoupling that may reduce plant growth and production in arid ecosystems. Soil pH, mainly reflecting long-term climate change in our sites, also contributes to the changing soil C-N-P stoichiometry, indicating the collective influences of climate and soil type on the shape of soil C-N-P balance.

AB Fishers' knowledge research is an approach to fisheries research that has a relatively long history, yet has generally failed to become integrated into the fisheries science mainstream alongside approaches that rely primarily on the knowledge of professional scientists. Its continued position on the margins of fisheries science has not however stopped fishers' knowledge researchers from publishing an expanding literature, which they often use to advocate for the greater consideration of fishers' knowledge by fisheries scientists and managers. They believe that the unique and often highly qualitative knowledge of fishers could inform better decision-making, resulting in improved socio-ecological outcomes for fisheries. This review first outlines the scope of the fishers' knowledge literature, before outlining five waves of fishers' knowledge research that have developed over the last century. For each wave, the nature of the fishers' knowledge documented during it is noted, as is the research and dissemination approach taken by its practitioners. The impact of that wave on mainstream fisheries science is then assessed. Overall, it is found that only one wave of fishers' knowledge research is beginning to have consistent success integrating with mainstream fisheries science, a wave that omits the research of many of the unique elements of fishers' knowledge. Other waves have died out, or are in danger of dying out, either because they have failed to be noticed by mainstream fisheries scientists or because mainstream fisheries scientists have not welcomed their outputs. It is summarized that fishers' knowledge research will only continue as a productive activity if mainstream fisheries scientists begin to open their discipline to other knowledge cultures and if fishers' knowledge researchers facilitate this action by disseminating their research so that it is more accessible to these scientists.

AB Abundance and population density are fundamental pieces of information for population ecology and species conservation, but they are difficult to estimate for rare and elusive species. Mark-resight models are popular for estimating population abundance because they are less invasive and expensive than traditional mark-recapture. However, density estimation using mark-resight is difficult because the area sampled must be explicitly defined, historically using ad hoc approaches. We developed a spatial mark-resight model for estimating population density that combines spatial resighting data and telemetry data. Incorporating telemetry data allows us to inform model parameters related to movement and individual location. Our model also allows <100% individual identification of marked individuals. We implemented the model in a Bayesian framework, using a custom-made Metropolis-within-Gibbs Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. As an example, we applied this model to a mark-resight study of raccoons (Procyon lotor) on South Core Banks, a barrier island in Cape Lookout National Seashore, North Carolina, USA. We estimated a population of 186.71 +/- 14.81 individuals, which translated to a density of 8.29 +/- 0.66 individuals/km(2) (mean +/- SD). The model presented here will have widespread utility in future applications, especially for species that are not naturally marked.

AB Across diverse ecosystems, greater climatic variability tends to increase wildfire size, particularly in Australia, where alternating wet-dry cycles increase vegetation growth, only to leave a dry overgrown landscape highly susceptible to fire spread. Aboriginal Australian hunting fires have been hypothesized to buffer such variability, mitigating mortality on small-mammal populations, which have suffered declines and extinctions in the arid zone coincident with Aboriginal depopulation. We test the hypothesis that the relationship between climate and fire size is buffered through the maintenance of an anthropogenic, fine-grained fire regime by comparing the effect of climatic variability on landscapes dominated by Martu Aboriginal hunting fires with those dominated by lightning fires. We show that Aboriginal fires are smaller, more tightly clustered, and remain small even when climate variation causes huge fires in the lightning region. As these effects likely benefit threatened small-mammal species, Aboriginal hunters should be considered trophic facilitators, and policies aimed at reducing the risk of large fires should promote land-management strategies consistent with Aboriginal burning regimes.

AB 1. If resistance traits drive recolonisation after drought, then drought refuges should contribute strongly to assemblage composition within streams. If resilience traits drive recolonisation, macroinvertebrates emerging from refuges may disperse widely, colonising many streams. To determine whether the contribution of drought refuges to macroinvertebrate recolonisation in non-perennial streams was mostly local (within stream) or broader scale (across streams), we measured the association between the composition of invertebrate assemblages in different types of in-stream drought refuge and the assemblage composition of streams when flow resumed.
   2. We sampled 16 streams of varying hydrological regime on the western side of the Victoria Range in the Grampians National Park, Victoria, Australia. Drought refuges (perennial pools, dry sediment, damp sediment, seeps, patches of leaf litter, beneath stones) were identified and sampled during autumn. Most taxa were found in perennial pools; few taxa were found aestivating beneath stones or having desiccation-resistant stages in dry sediment. Perennial pools and perennially flowing reaches were the refuges that harboured the greatest diversity of macroinvertebrate taxa.
   3. Streams were sampled again during spring. Assemblage composition of non-perennial reaches in spring was unrelated to composition in nearby refuges in the previous autumn. In contrast, assemblage composition in perennial reaches during spring was strongly correlated with composition during autumn. Therefore, drought refuges did not directly influence assemblage composition locally within non-perennial streams. Rather, both perennially flowing reaches and perennial pools acted as drought refuges across the broader landscape. Resilience traits are likely to drive recolonisation in these streams.
   4. Monitoring of drought refuges in a particular stream will therefore not predict species composition when flow resumes. Drought refuges are likely to sustain biodiversity over larger spatial scales such as groups of streams or whole drainage networks. Consequently, stream networks will need to be managed as entities rather than as single waterways and the focus of drought refuge protection should be on perennial pools and reaches.

AB Several proposals have been launched under the new concept 'integrative taxonomy' to frame the future development of species discovery and description. We consider that some of those proposals have failed to be truly integrative, by not acknowledging the limitations of operational definitions of species, by defending some kinds of evidence as universally superior, by considering taxonomy to be irreconcilable with population genetics, or by ignoring that the heterogeneity of evolutionary processes often precludes full character congruence in species. Here we defend a taxonomy where species exist, but not in any particular way everyone might want them to exist; a taxonomy open to data and methods from population biology, phylogeography and phylogenetics, as well as any other discipline providing evidence about the origin and evolution of species. This new taxonomy embraces all the consequences of considering species as lineages of reproductive populations, encouraging the use of as many lines of evidence as possible, but without negating that a single line may also be the only one providing evidence for a particular species. Species cannot only be those reproductive populations showing broad character congruence and/or reproductive isolation, due to the different degrees of character congruence, as well as of reproductive isolation, that result from the heterogeneity of evolutionary processes causing lineage splitting and divergence. Also, any kind of character - and not only those established by tradition or fashion - is potentially relevant as evidence of lineage divergence. To conciliate the authors who only see species supported by broad character congruence as good species hypotheses, we explain how a hypothesis can gain corroboration using single or multiple lines of evidence, even in cases of discordance with other lines of evidence. Finally, we propose guidelines to identify the expected degree of stability (preliminary, unstable, and stable) of species hypotheses.

AB The combined effects of drought and low light on biomass partition, foliar nitrogen concentration, membrane stability and active oxygen species (AOS) and antioxidant system were investigated in dragon spruce (Picea asperata Mast.) seedlings grown at two watering regimes (well-watered, 100% of field capacity and drought, 30% of field capacity) and light availabilities (HL, 100% of full sunlight and low light, 15% of full sunlight). Under high light condition drought not only reduced foliar nitrogen concentration (Nmass) and membrane stability index (MSI) but also significantly increased biomass partitioning to roots, AOS, ascorbic acid (AsA) content and antioxidant enzyme activities including superoxide dismutase (SOD, EC 1.15.1.1), peroxidase (POD, EC 1.11.1.7), catalase (CAT, EC 1.11.1.6), ascorbate peroxidase (APX, EC 1.11.1.11) and glutathione reductase(GR, EC 1.6.4.2). However, no prominently drought-induced differences in biomass partitioning to root, SOD, GR activities, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and MSI were observed in low light seedlings. On the other hand, significant interaction of drought and low light was found on MSI, the antioxidant enzymes activities (SOD, POD, CAT, APX, GR), H2O2 and superoxide radical (O-2(-)). These results suggested that seedlings grown at the understory were more sensitive to drought than low light.

AB South-west Australia is a region of remarkable biological diversity, predominantly shaped by diversity of climate and geomorphology. Fire has also played an important role in shaping biodiversity over at least 2.5 million years and anthropogenic fire has been a part of this environment for tens of thousands of years. Forest ecosystems are fire-maintained, having evolved traits that enable them to persist with, and depend upon a variety of fire regimes. No single regime is optimal for all organisms and communities, but diverse regimes, within ecological limits, are essential for maintaining biodiversity. Bushfires can also threaten people, property and industry so fire management, including proactive use of fire, is necessary to both conserve biodiversity and to reduce the negative impacts of bushfires. There exists a substantial body of fire ecology literature for these ecosystems. If on-ground fire management is to advance commensurate with advances in fire science, then this often complex plethora of information needs to be synthesized, simplified and presented as practical fire management paradigms, policies and prescriptions. This paper attempts to achieve this by describing a range of evidence-based practical fire regimes that can be implemented to conserve biodiversity and to protect human life and property in south-west Australian forests.

AB Global climate change is leading to redistribution of marine species and altering ecosystem dynamics. Given recent poleward range extension of the barrens-forming sea urchin Centrostephanus rodgersii (Diadematidae) from mainland Australia to Tasmania, there is a need to understand the population dynamics of this ecologically important species in the Tasmanian environment. This paper informs possible population dynamics of C. rodgersii in Tasmania by examining its reproductive ecology in this new environment. Reproductive periodicity (gonad index and propensity to spawn) was assessed bimonthly over 18 months at four sites in eastern Tasmania spanning similar to 2 degrees in latitude. At all sites, C. rodgersii displayed a strong seasonal cycle in gonad production with major spawning occurring in winter (similar to August) at minimum annual water temperature. Gametes from Tasmanian C. rodgersii were viable as determined by fertilization and early development trials. However, development to the two-arm stage at similar to 3 weeks was strongly dependent on water temperature across the 8-20 degrees C temperature range, with poor development occurring below 12 degrees C. The range of temperatures tolerated by Tasmanian C. rodgersii larvae was similar to that of larvae from its native New South Wales range, indicating that this species has not undergone an adaptive shift to the cooler Tasmanian environment. There was also no evidence for an adaptive shift in reproductive phenology. Importantly, coastal water temperatures in eastern Tasmania during the peak spawning in August fluctuate about the 12 degrees C larval development threshold. Recent warming of the eastern Tasmanian coast and further warming predicted by global climate change will result in an environment increasingly favourable for the reproduction and development of C. rodgersii.

AB Aim Many species are currently expanding their ranges in response to climate change, but the mechanisms underlying these range expansions are in many cases poorly understood. In this paper we explore potential climatic factors governing the recent establishment of new palm populations far to the north of any other viable palm population in the world.
   Location Southern Switzerland, Europe, Asia and the world.
   Methods We identified ecological threshold values for the target species, Trachycarpus fortunei, based on gridded climate data, altitude and distributional records from the native range and applied them to the introduced range using local field monitoring and measured meteorological data as well as a bioclimatic model.
   Results We identified a strong relationship between minimum winter temperatures, influenced by growing season length and the distribution of the palm in its native range. Recent climate change strongly coincides with the palm's recent spread into southern Switzerland, which is in concert with the expansion of the global range of palms across various continents.
   Main conclusions Our results strongly suggest that the expansion of palms into (semi-)natural forests is driven by changes in winter temperature and growing season length and not by delayed population expansion. This implies that this rapid expansion is likely to continue in the future under a warming climate. Palms in general, and T. fortunei in particular, are significant bioindicators across continents for present-day climate change and reflect a global signal towards warmer conditions.

AB The landscape of the Pilbara region of Western Australia has been relatively unchanged for 100 million years. The ancient river systems of this region might be expected to be sources of isolation and divergence for aquatic species. Hence, the occurrence of widespread groundwater taxa in this landscape offers the opportunity to examine associations between genetic diversity and drainage patterns. Pilbarus and Chydaekata are two widespread genera of subterranean amphipods endemic to the Pilbara, each occupying multiple tributaries. We used molecular data to examine the roles of drainage patterns in structuring genetic diversity. Gene flow within a tributary may be facilitated by the occasional occurrence of these amphipods in springs, which results in their downstream dispersal during episodic flooding. However, tributary boundaries may form hydrological barriers to gene flow, resulting in localised isolation of populations and divergence. Samples of both genera, collected throughout three river basins, were examined for sequence divergence in the cytochrome c oxidase I mitochondrial gene. There was no evidence of contemporary gene flow among populations of either genus, and each tributary contained highly divergent lineages, which were not associated with similar morphological differentiation. This suggests cryptic speciation has occurred, and similar phylogenetic signals in both taxa imply similar evolutionary histories. Surface populations may have been driven into subterranean refugia by the cessation of flow in the rivers, associated with Tertiary climate change, while morphological evolution may have been constrained by stabilising selection. The lack of congruence between molecular diversity and morphology raises important practical issues for conservation.

AB We have analyzed partial DNA sequences of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene from extant striped, brown, and spotted hyenas as well as from Pleistocene cave hyenas. Sequences of the Pleistocene cave hyenas from Eurasia and modern spotted hyenas from Africa are intermixed in phylogenetic analyses, questioning any taxonomic delineation between the two groups. Contrary to cave hyenas in Eurasia, spotted hyenas in Africa show a phylogeographic pattern with little geographical overlap between two mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) clades, suggesting two Pleistocene refugia in the north and south of Africa. Our results, furthermore, suggest three waves of migration from Africa to Eurasia for spotted hyenas, around 3, 1, and 0.3 MYA. A recent emigration of striped hyenas from Africa to Eurasia took place less than 0.1 MYA, resulting in a dramatic expansion of the geographical range of striped hyenas. In striped hyenas and within the geographical range of mtDNA clades in spotted hyenas, we found identical sequences several thousand kilometers apart, indicating a high rate of migration during the Pleistocene as well as the Holocene. Both striped and brown hyenas show low amounts of genetic diversity, with the latter ones displaying just a single haplotype.

AB Introns have gained considerable popularity as markers for molecular phylogenetics. However, no primers exist for a nuclear intron that amplifies across all turtles. Available data from morphology and mitochondrial DNA have not unambiguously resolved relationships within the superfamily Trionychoidea and the family Chelidae, which together form a large portion of extant turtle diversity. We tested the phylogenetic utility of a novel intron from the RNA fingerprint protein 35 (R35) as applied to these two areas of turtle systematics. We found the intron to be a single-copy locus that provides excellent resolving power for lineages among turtles, though problems with alignment made it impossible to infer deeper amniote relationships. Maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood both demonstrated the polyphyly of Trionychoidea and the reciprocal monophyly of Australian/New Guinea and South American chelid turtles. This is the first study to resolve such relationships with strong statistical support, and we suggest that R35 holds great promise for resolving additional persistent problems in the phylogeny of living turtles.

AB The internal transcribed spacer (ITS) of nuclear ribosomal DNA has been widely used by systematists for reconstructing phylogenies of closely related taxa. Although the occurrence of ITS putative pseudogenes is well documented for many groups of animals and plants, the potential utility of these pseudogenes in phylogenetic analyses has often been underestimated or even ignored in part because of deletions that make unambiguous alignment difficult. In addition, long branches often can lead to spurious relationships, particularly in parsimony analyses. We have discovered unusually high levels of ITS polymorphism (up to 30%, 40%, and 14%, respectively) in three tropical tree species of the coffee family (Rubiaceae), Adinauclea fagifolia, Haldina cordifolia, and Mitragyna rubrostipulata. Both secondary structure stability and patterns of nucleotide substitutions in a highly conserved region (5.8S gene) were used for distinguishing presumed functional sequences from putative pseudogenes. The combination of both criteria was the most powerful approach. The sequences from A. fagifolia appear to be a mix of functional genes and highly distinct putative pseudogenes, whereas those from H. cordifolia and M. rubrostipulata were identified as putative pseudogenes. We explored the potential utility of the identified putative pseudogenes in the phylogenetic analyses of Naucleeae sensu lato. Both Bayesian and parsimony trees identified the same monophyletic groups and indicated that the polymorphisms do not transcend species boundaries, implying that they do not predate the divergence of these three species. The resulting trees are similar to those produced by previous analyses of chloroplast genes. In contrast to results of previous studies therefore, divergent putative pseudogenes can be useful for phylogenetic analyses, especially when no sequences of their functional counterparts are available. Our studies clearly show that ITS polymorphism may not necessarily mislead phylogenetic inference. Despite using many different PCR conditions ( different primers, higher denaturing temperatures, and absence or presence of DMSO and BSA-TMACl), we recovered only a few functional ITS copies from A. fagifolia and none from H. cordifolia and M. rubrostipulata, which suggests that PCR selection is occurring and/or the presumed functional alleles are located at minor loci ( with few ribosomal DNA copies).

AB The north-western Mediterranean Sea's high biodiversity originates from a mixture of temperate and subtropical species. Large-scale warming has been detected through northward range shifts of 'warm-water' species, and mass-mortality events for 'cold-water' invertebrates. Marine caves are affected in a more subtle way. By monitoring endemic species of cave mysids (Crustacea) and comparing our results with data in the literature, we observed a strong decline in one species, coupled with the success of another. Near Marseille (France), this phenomenon began while two major thermal anomalies were reported. Different tolerances to temperature were demonstrated by both the species distribution ranges and laboratory experimentation. We provide a possible physiological explanation for populations of cold stenothermal species of endemic cave mysids being replaced by congeners of warmer affinities, with a high risk of extinction. We also found strong support for the view that Mediterranean marine biodiversity is already under the threat of global warming.

AB If occurrence of individual species can be modeled as a function of easily quantified environmental variables (e.g., derived from a geographic information system [GIS]) and the predictions of these models are demonstrably successful, then the scientific foundation for management planning will be strengthened. We used Bayesian logistic regression to develop predictive models for resident butterflies in the central Great Basin of western North America. Species inventory data and values for 14 environmental variables from 49 locations (segments of canyons) in the Toquima Range (Nevada, US.A.) were used to build the models. Squares of the environmental variables were also used to accommodate possibly nonmonotonic responses. We obtained statistically significant models for 36 of 56 (64%) resident species of butterflies. The models explained 8-72% of the deviance in occurrence of those species, Each of the independent variables was significant in at least one model, and squared versions of five variables contributed to models. Elevation was included in more than half of the models. Models included one to four variables; only one variable was significant in about half the models. We conducted preliminary tests of two of our models by using an existing set of data on the occurrence of butterflies in the neighboring Toiyabe Range. We compared conventional logistic classification with posterior probability distributions derived from Bayesian modeling. For the latter, we restricted our predictions to locations with a high (70%) probability of predicted presence or absence. We will perform further tests after conducting inventories at new locations in the Toquima Range and nearby Shoshone Mountains, for which we have computed environmental variables by using remotely acquired topographic data, digital-terrain and microclimatic models, and GIS computation.

AB Literature reports show little effect of nitrogen supply on radiation use efficiency in potato and in other dicotyledonous C-3 species. This paper tests the hypothesis that potato reduces leaf size rather than leaf nitrogen concentration and photosynthetic capacity when nitrogen is in shea supply. Four pot experiments with different rates of nitrogen supply were conducted in glasshouses. For two leaf numbers measurements were made of leaf area, P-max (rate of photosynthesis for saturating irradiance), specific leaf weight, and concentrations of total nitrogen and nitrate, all as a function of leaf age.
   Area per leaf was sensitive to nitrogen supply (about a factor 3 between extreme N treatments). P-max declined with leaf age. There were no systematic effects of nitrogen supply on P-max and on its change with leaf age, except that in some cases P-max of leaves of high N treatments was lower than P-max of low N treatments during part of the life span (leaf age of ca. 20-50 days). The dominant effect of nitrogen supply was on leaf size and not on P-max or leaf N content. P-max versus areal organic nitrogen concentration (g N m(-2) leaf area) showed considerable scatter and, for a given nitrogen concentration, a slightly lower P-max for high N treatments than for low N treatments. Comparison with other species showed a comparatively low value of P-max in potato. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB To investigate the phylogenetic relationships and geographical structure among brown trout S. trutta L. populations from the South Adriatic-Ionian and Aegean sea basins, mitochondrial DNA nucleotide sequence comparisons were used. A 310-base-pair (bp) segment of the control region (D-loop), and an additional 280-bp segment of the cytochrome b gene were sequenced from representatives of 13 brown trout populations. Phylogenetic analyses, conducted after combining the data presented with published data from other Eurasian brown trout, revealed four major phylogenetic groups, three of which were found widely distributed within the southern Balkan region. The phylogeographical patterns revealed by mtDNA represent one of the few cases where phylogenetic discontinuity in a gene tree exists without obvious geographical localization within a species' range and has most likely resulted from the differentiation of the major mtDNA clades during Messinian or early Pleistocene times. Finally, the genetic relationships among the populations suggested by mtDNA were generally not in accordance with either allozyme or morphological data.

AB Differences in reproductive demands between the sexes of dioecious plants could cause divergence in physiology between the sexes. We found that the reproductive effort of female Silene latifolia plants increased to more than twice that of male plants or female plants that were prevented from setting fruit by lack of pollination after 4 weeks of flowering. Whole-plant source/sink ratios of pollinated females were significantly lower than those of males or unpollinated females because of investment in fruit. We hypothesized that these differences in source/sink ratio between the sexes and within females, depending on pollination, would lead to differences in leaf photosynthetic rates. Within females, we found that photosynthetic capacity was consistent with measurement of whole-plant source/sink ratio. Females that were setting fruit had 30% higher light-saturated photosynthetic rates by 28 days after flowering than females that were not setting fruit. Males, however, had consistently higher photosynthetic rates than females from 10 days after flowering onwards. Males also had approximately twice the dark respiration rates of fruiting females. We found that female reproductive structures are longer-lived and contribute more carbon to their own support than male reproductive structures. Despite the higher rates of leaf dark respiration and lower calyx photosynthetic rates, males fix more carbon than do females. We conclude that females have a sink-regulated mechanism of photosynthesis that allows them to respond to variations in fruit set. This mechanism is not, however, sufficient to explain why male S. latifolia plants have higher rates of photosynthesis, higher source/sink ratios, and lower reproductive allocation, but fail to grow larger than female plants.

AB Prognostic and mechanistic schemes for the determination of plant phenological stages from environmental conditions and for the estimation of net primary production (NPP) are presented. The new schemes account for different biomes and are included in a global model of carbon cycling in the terrestrial biosphere. The capability of such a model to simulate the seasonal cycle of atmospheric CO2 is explored. The model is forced by mean monthly climate variables (temperature, precipitation and Light) and the mean annual CO2 concentration. It predicts atmosphere-biosphere CO2 exchange fluxes, leaf area index (LAI), and the times of budburst and leaf abcission. The predicted variables can be validated against data on the observed annual cycle of atmospheric CO2 concentration and against observations of LAI derived from satellite data. The estimated annual NPP of forests appeared realistic; however, the NPP of grass-dominated biomes was greatly underestimated. This seems to be related to the fact that belowground biomass is not explicitly considered in the model. The results of a simulation of the seasonal cycle of atmospheric CO2 concentration using a 3-dimensional atmospheric transport model were in satisfactory agreement with the observations.

AB A study was carried out on the root distribution and root activity of the olive tree (Olea Europaea, L., var. manzanillo) as influenced by drip irrigation and by several soil characteristics such as texture and depth.  The experiments were conducted in two plots within a drip-irrigated grove of 20-year-old trees planted at 7 x 7 m spacing.  One soil was a sandy loam, the other a clay-loam.  Both cylinder and trench methods were used to determine root distribution.  Labelling with P-32 was used to determine root activity.  Under dryland conditions the adult tree adapted its rooting system, following the installation of a drip system, by concentrating the roots within the wet soil zones near the drippers.  The highest root densities occur in those zones, down to a 0.6 m depth, the most abundant being the < 0.5 mm diameter roots.  The most intensive root activity was also found in that zone.  For a given irrigation system, wet soil bulbs are more extensive and therefore root distribution expands to a larger soil volume when the soil is more clayey and with a hard calcareous pan present at about 0.8 m depth which prevents deep drainage.

AB Invasive alien species (IASs) on islands have broad impacts across biodiversity, agriculture, economy, health and culture, which tend to be stronger than on continents. Across small-island developing states (SIDSs), although only a small number of IASs are widely distributed, many more, including those with greatest impact, are found on only a small number of islands. Patterns of island invasion are not consistent across SIDS geographic regions, with differences attributable to correlated patterns in island biogeography and human development. We identify 15 of the most globally prevalent IASs on islands. IAS impacts on islands are exacerbated through interactions with a number of other global change threats, including over-exploitation, agricultural intensification, urban development and climate change. Biosecurity is critical in preventing IAS invasion of islands. Eradication of IASs on islands is possible at early stages of invasion, but otherwise is largely restricted to invasive mammals, or otherwise control is the only option. Future directions in IAS management and research on islands must consider IASs within a broader portfolio of threats to species, ecosystems and people's livelihoods on islands. We advocate for stronger collaborations among island countries and territories faced with the same IASs in similar socio-ecological environments.

AB Identifying and quantifying the influential factors on incident clearance time can benefit incident management for accident causal analysis and prediction, and consequently mitigate the impact of non-recurrent congestion. Traditional incident clearance time studies rely on either statistical models with rigorous assumptions or artificial intelligence (AI) approaches with poor interpretability. This paper proposes a novel method, gradient boosting decision trees (GBDTs), to predict the nonlinear and imbalanced incident clearance time based on different types of explanatory variables. The GBDT inherits both the advantages of statistical models and AI approaches, and can identify the complex and nonlinear relationship while computing the relative importance among variables. One-year crash data from Washington state, USA, incident tracking system are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of GBDT method. Based on the distribution of incident clearance time, two groups are categorized for prediction with a 15-min threshold. A comparative study confirms that the GBDT method is significantly superior to other algorithms for incidents with both short and long clearance times. In addition, incident response time is found to be the greatest contributor to short clearance time with more than 41% relative importance, while traffic volume generates the second greatest impact on incident clearance time with relative importance of 27.34% and 19.56%, respectively.

AB 1. Roots vary in anatomy, morphology and physiology, both spatially (different parts of the same root system) and temporally (plastic changes, root ageing), suggesting that root trait measurements are strongly affected by root sampling categories.
   2. In this context, it is urgent to clarify the functional significance of current root sampling categories (e.g. fine roots of the first order, the first three orders, <= 1 mm or <= 2 mm), establish guidelines for choosing between sampling methods and revise root ontology to account for functional differences between traits measured on distinct root categories.
   3. Here, we used a worldwide database of fine-root traits to test the hypothesis that distinct fine-root trait values - with link to fine-root functions - were generally affected by different root sampling categories. We observed indeed a clear functional break between first-order roots and roots of all three other sampling categories, and a smaller but substantial break between roots of the three first orders and the <= 2 mm category, demonstrating globally that different sampling methodologies capture different functional parts of roots.
   4. Our synthesis suggests that all current root sampling categories present both advantages and pitfalls and that no single method can appropriately tackle the main current challenge of root functional ecology: i. e. linking fine roots to plant and ecosystem functions in a truly comparable way across all plants. We argue instead that a small set of complementary standardized sampling methods is necessary to capture the linkages between root forms and functions.
   5. To assist experimenters selecting adequate sampling we developed a decision table following three logical questions: i) what plant or ecosystem function must be addressed; (ii) what root categories are involved in this function and (iii) what traits should be measured on these root categories. Challenging, strengthening and expending such common reference framework would be a substantial step towards wider comparability of future functional trait datasets.

AB Sustainable intensification (SI) is at the forefront of food security discussions as a means to meet the growing demand for agricultural production while conserving land and other resources. A broader definition of SI is emerging that takes into account the human condition, nutrition and social equity. Next steps require identification of indicators and associated metrics, to track progress, assess tradeoffs and identify synergies. Through a systematic, qualitative review of the literature we identified SI indicators, with a primary focus on African smallholder farming systems. We assessed indicators and metrics for which there is consensus, and those that remain contested. We conclude that, while numerous metrics for evaluating SI systems exist, many often-cited indicators lack strong sets of associated metrics.

AB In the marine environment Species Distribution Models (SDMs) have been used in hundreds of papers for predicting the present and future geographic range and environmental niche of species. We have analyzed ways in which SDMs are being applied to marine species in order to recommend best practice in future studies. This systematic review was registered as a protocol on the Open Science Framework: https://osf.io/tngs6/. The literature reviewed (236 papers) was published between 1992 and July 2016. The number of papers significantly increased through time (R-2 = 0.92, p < 0.05). The studies were predominantly carried out in the Temperate Northern Atlantic (45%) followed by studies of global scale (11%) and studies in Temperate Australasia (10%). The majority of studies reviewed focused on theoretical ecology (37%) including investigations of biological invasions by non-native organisms, conservation planning (19%), and climate change predictions (17%). Most of the studies were published in ecological, multidisciplinary, or biodiversity conservation journals. Most of the studies (94%) failed to report the amount of uncertainty derived from data deficiencies and model parameters. Best practice recommendations are proposed here to ensure that novice and advanced SDM users can (a) understand the main elements of SDMs, (b) reproduce standard methods and analysis, and (c) identify potential limitations with their data. We suggest that in the future, studies of marine SDMs should report on key features of the approaches employed, data deficiencies, the selection of the best explanatory model, and the approach taken to validate the SDM results. In addition, based on the literature reviewed, we suggest that future marine SDMs should account for uncertainty levels as part of the modeling process.

AB In the context of sustainable forest management and climate change, increasing tree richness has been proposed as a possible strategy to reach both ecological and productivity goals. This review focuses on the effects of mixed stands and increasing tree richness on soil fauna in temperate forests. Effects on earthworm and microarthropod (Collembola and Oribatid Mites) species diversity and abundance and community structure are examined, and clues to the main factors affecting soil communities in these stands are proposed.
   Our statistical analyses showed no evidence of any general trend for the effect of mixture either on earthworm or microarthropod diversity or on their abundance. Indeed, positive, negative and nonsignificant effects have all been reported. Nevertheless, the majority of the studies did find that increased tree richness or the introduction of broad-leaves had a positive effect. In addition, our review shows that soil organism abundance and diversity can be strongly affected by the presence of certain tree species and that the soil organism community structure is, in most cases, significantly affected by an increase in. tree richness or by a mixing effect. Litter features appear to be important drivers of soil fauna community composition, while mixture effect seems to have less impact on soil biota. Soil fauna are directly affected by the physical characteristics (microhabitats) and chemical composition (resource quality) of the litter specific to each tree species. Soil communities are then indirectly affected by the subsequent humus characteristics. We conclude our review with some guidelines for forest management and further research. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Climate change is an important cause of the irreversible transformation of habitats, of the rapid extinction of species, and of the dramatic changes in entire communities, especially for tropical assemblages and for habitat and range-restricted species, such as mountaintop and polar species.
   In particular, climate change effects several aspects of animal sounds (e.g., song amplitude and frequency, song post, and sound phenology). Animal sounds, which are life traits characterized by high plasticity, are able to cope with even modest variations of environmental fundamentals like vegetation cover, land mosaic structure, temperature, humidity, and pH (for aquatic medium). Moreover, the climatic effects on these biophonies can be observed earlier than change in vegetation patterns and visible landscape structures.
   Ecoacoustics, the discipline that investigates the role of sound on animal ecology from species to landscapes, offers robust models, such as acoustic adaptation, acoustic niche, acoustic active space, acoustic community, and acoustic phenology to investigate the effect of climate change on species, populations, communities, and landscapes.
   From an operational perspective, ecoacoustics procedures can be applied in different contexts, such as locations, weather, species, populations, behavior, physiology, and phenology. In addition, thematic priorities can be selected, such as latitudinal and altitudinal gradients, restricted habitats, stopover areas, extreme environments, weather conditions, short distance migrants, species at high vocal plasticity, sink-source status, active space, social attraction, physiological modifications, dawn and dusk choruses, sound from stressed plants, and time series analysis.
   The noninvasiveness of passive acoustic recording, the simultaneous collection of important data, such as community richness and diversity, immigration and extinction events, and singing dynamics as well as the availability of innovative noninvasive technologies operating over a long-term period, establish ecoacoustics as a new and important tool with which it is possible to analyze massive acoustic data sets and quickly predict and/or evaluate the effects of climate change on the environment. Moreover, passive recording is supported by cheap, user-friendly field sensors and robust data processing and may be part of the citizen science research agenda on climate change.

AB The yellow-legged hornet, Vespa velutina, was accidentally introduced from Southeast Asia and then invaded France and Korea over the last 10 years. Since its introduction, its predation on honeybee colonies has rapidly become an economic problem in invaded countries. Using mitochondrial cytochrome C oxidase and 22 nuclear microsatellite loci, we showed that native hornet populations were well differentiated and highly diverse. In contrast, introduced populations from France and Korea suffered a genetic bottleneck, which did not prevent their rapid geographic expansion. Analysis of the genetic data indicates that French and Korean populations likely arose from two independent introduction events. The most probable source population is from an area between the Chinese provinces of Zhejiang and Jiangsu. This invasion route is in agreement with knowledge on trade and historical records. By studying colonies of V. velutina, we demonstrated its polyandry, which is very rare among Vespidae. This mating behavior could have favored the success of this Asian hornet in Europe and Korea. Combined, the population and colony results suggest that very few or possibly only one single multi-mated female gave rise to the invasion.

AB The transformation of organic amendments (OA) in soil is in large part performed by soil microbial communities. These processes are strongly affected by the carbon composition of the OAs. We examined microbial community responses to three types of OA: green waste, composted green waste and pyrolysed green waste added to two contrasting agricultural soils. We investigated the relationship between the soil carbon composition (as determined by C-13-solid state NMR), microbial community composition (as determined by phospholipid fatty acid analysis) and microbial activity (as determined by soil enzyme assays). We found that alkyl-C, O-aryl-C, aryl-C and carbonyl-C were able to explain most of the variations (>= 50%) in soil microbial community composition and activity. Aryl-C content (reflecting relatively stable carbon forms) strongly influenced microbial composition, while carbonyl-C content (reflecting relatively labile carbon forms) strongly influenced the microbial activity. Our results confirm that there is a tight relationship between carbon composition and soil microbial community composition and function. Results are discussed in the context of examining the relationship between carbon forms, microbial community composition and activity following the addition of different OAs to the soil.

AB Native forests play an important role regarding ecosystem services related to biodiversity, water, and nutrient cycling, and the intensity of those services should be related to the amount, configuration and quality of the forest. However, in highly dynamic landscapes, such as some tropical regions, ecosystem services are potentially affected not only by the present landscape structure, but also by the historical land use. Here we propose a simple methodological framework to evaluate the contribution of past landscape dynamics and present landscape structure in the provision of ecosystem services. We applied this framework to a traditional agricultural landscape from the Brazilian Atlantic Forest hotspot, where natural forests cover has increased from 8 to 16 % in the last 60 years (1962-2008), and where old forests are being reduced while young forests are being regenerated. Forests of different ages, in association with current landscape structure, reveal a mosaic of forest patches under different conditions, implying different abilities to deliver ecosystem services. With the replacement of old-growth forests by young-regenerating forests and a high level of forest fragmentation, less than 1/4 of the current forest cover is able to fully satisfy the ecosystem service demands. To avoid such tendency, government policies should not only focus on increasing forest cover, but also in conserving old-growth forest fragments or increasing forest quality. The proposed methodology allows integrating historical land use and current landscape structure to evaluate ecosystem services provision and can be useful to establish programs of payment for ecosystem services.

AB QuestionsIn species response modelling, can a hierarchical logistic regression framework compete against GAM in terms of statistical inference? Are bimodal shapes useful to model species responses along ecological gradients?
   LocationGermany.
   MethodsIn hierarchical logistic regression modelling [also known as Huisman, Olff, Fresco (HOF) models], the best model is chosen from a set of predetermined models using statistical information criteria, i.e. a balance between model fit to the data and simplicity of the model. We extended the classical five model types with two bimodal shapes. We improved the model optimization process to inhibit unrealistically steep slopes and abrupt changes. The stability of model choices is safeguarded through bootstrapping. The framework was tested on a data set of 547 vegetation plots of arable land with measured soil pH(KCL). The ability to reproduce known shapes was tested with artificial data sets. Shape parameters, e.g. niche width and range, slope (turnover) and species optima, can be calculated from the models and used for further analyses. The model framework together with advanced plot functions is included in the package eHOF for the statistical software environment R.
   ResultsBased on the AIC, 66 out of 131 species are modelled with a better compromise between model fit and model complexity by one of the logistic regression models as compared to GAM with automatic smoother selection. Within the model framework, 17 species (13%) are best modelled with one of the new bimodal types. The test with artificial data of known shape reveals good reliability of eHOF models for unimodal responses in areas with homogeneous information, but increasing uncertainty if the sampling is uneven or if only a part of the response is covered within the observed gradient range.
   ConclusionsHierarchical logistic regression models offer a flexible way to efficiently fit species response data. They propose a sound theoretical background for ecological interpretation. Extended HOF models as presented here are judged as an effective tool for univariate species response modelling.

AB The development of fine-resolution climate grids is an important priority in explaining species' distributions at the regional scale and predicting how species may respond to variable and changing climates. Recent studies have demonstrated advantages of producing these grids using large networks of inexpensive climate loggers, as the resulting grids can capture local climatic variations over a range of environments. In this study we extend these methods to develop innovative fine-resolution (25 m) climate grids for a large region (similar to 200 x 300 km) of New South Wales, Australia. The key aspects of these grids is that they: (1) are based on near-surface (5 cm) observations to better reflect where many species live; (2) cover a wide variety of habitats including forests, woodlands and grasslands so that they are broadly applicable; (3) include both temperature and humidity, the latter of which has often been neglected in similar studies; (4) are developed using a variety of climate-forcing factors rather than relying only on elevation and geographic location; and (5) they focus on the extreme temperatures and humidities regardless of when these occur. Analyses showed that elevation was the dominant factor explaining mild temperatures (low maximums, high minimums), but cold air drainage, distance from coast, canopy cover and topographic exposure had more effect on the extreme maximum and minimum temperatures. Humidities were predominately determined by distance to coast, elevation, canopy cover and topography; however, the relationships were nonlinear and varied in both shape and effect size between dry and moist extremes. Extreme climates occur under specific weather conditions, and our results highlight how averaging climates over seasons or periods of consecutive days will include different weather patterns and obscure important trends. Regional-scale climate grids can potentially be further improved through a better understanding of how the effects of different climate-forcing factors vary under different weather conditions.

AB Aim Species specialization, which plays a fundamental role in niche differentiation and species coexistence, is a key biological trait in relation to the responses of populations to changing environments. Species with a limited niche breadth are considered to experience a higher risk of extinction than generalist species. This work aims to measure the degree of specialization in the regional flora of the French Alps and test whether species specialization is related to species rarity and ecological characteristics.
   Location This study was conducted in the French Alps region, which encompasses a large elevational gradient over a relatively limited area (26,000 km(2)).
   Methods Specialization was estimated for approximately 1200 plant species found in the region. Given the inherent difficulty of pinpointing the critical environmental niche axes for each individual species, we used a co-occurrence-based index to estimate species niche breadths (specialization index). This comprehensive measurement included crucial undetermined limiting niche factors, acting on both local and regional scales, and related to both biotic and abiotic interactions. The specialization index for each species was then related to a selection of plant typologies such as Grime strategies and Raunkiaer life-forms, and to two measurements of plant rarity, namely regional area of occupancy and local abundance.
   Results Specialist species were mainly found in specific and harsh environments such as wetlands, cold alpine habitats and dry heathlands. These species were usually geographically restricted but relatively dominant in their local communities. Although none of the selected traits were sufficient predictors of specialization, pure competitors were over-represented amongst generalist species, whereas stress-tolerant species tended to be more specialized.
   Main conclusions Our results suggest that co-occurrence-based indices of niche breadth are a satisfactory method for inferring plant specialization using large species samples across very heterogeneous environments. Our results are an empirical validation of the tolerance-dominance trade-off and also provide interesting insights into the long-standing question of which biological properties characterize species with narrow niche breadth that are potentially threatened by global changes in the environment.

AB Background: Species distribution models are often used to characterize a species' native range climate, so as to identify sites elsewhere in the world that may be climatically similar and therefore at risk of invasion by the species. This endeavor provoked intense public controversy over recent attempts to model areas at risk of invasion by the Indian Python (Python molurus). We evaluated a number of MaxEnt models on this species to assess MaxEnt's utility for vertebrate climate matching.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Overall, we found MaxEnt models to be very sensitive to modeling choices and selection of input localities and background regions. As used, MaxEnt invoked minimal protections against data dredging, multi-collinearity of explanatory axes, and overfitting. As used, MaxEnt endeavored to identify a single ideal climate, whereas different climatic considerations may determine range boundaries in different parts of the native range. MaxEnt was extremely sensitive to both the choice of background locations for the python, and to selection of presence points: inclusion of just four erroneous localities was responsible for Pyron et al.'s conclusion that no additional portions of the U. S. mainland were at risk of python invasion. When used with default settings, MaxEnt overfit the realized climate space, identifying models with about 60 parameters, about five times the number of parameters justifiable when optimized on the basis of Akaike's Information Criterion.
   Conclusions/Significance: When used with default settings, MaxEnt may not be an appropriate vehicle for identifying all sites at risk of colonization. Model instability and dearth of protections against overfitting, multi-collinearity, and data dredging may combine with a failure to distinguish fundamental from realized climate envelopes to produce models of limited utility. A priori identification of biologically realistic model structure, combined with computational protections against these statistical problems, may produce more robust models of invasion risk.

AB We investigated the internal phylogeny of Laniatores, the most diverse suborder of Opiliones, using sequence data from 10 molecular loci: 12S rRNA, 16S rRNA, 18S rRNA, 28S rRNA, cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI), cytochrome b, elongation factor-1 alpha, histones H3 and H4, and U2 snRNA. Exemplars of all previously described families of Laniatores were included, in addition to two families - Petrobunidae, fam. nov. and Tithaeidae, fam. nov. - that we erect herein. Data analyses were based on maximum likelihood and Bayesian approaches on static alignments, and included phylogenetic tree estimation, molecular dating, and biogeographic analysis of ancestral area reconstruction. The results obtained include the monophyly of Laniatores and the infraorder Grassatores - the focus of this study - as well as support for numerous interfamilial relationships. The two new families described cluster with other South-east Asian families (Podoctidae and Epedanidae). Diversification of Laniatores is estimated at similar to 348 Mya, and origin of most Grassatores superfamilies occurs in a similar to 25 million year span of time immediately after the end-Permian mass extinction (254 Mya). Ancestral range reconstruction of the clade (Samooidea + Zalmoxoidea) suggests that the ancestral range of Samooidea comprises West Tropical Gondwana (West Africa + Neotropics), whereas that of Zalmoxoidea is exclusively Neotropical. The following additional taxonomic changes are proposed: (1) Remyus is transferred to Phalangodidae, and (2) Escadabiidae and Kimulidae are transferred to Zalmoxoidea.

AB Species distribution models have often been developed based on ecological data. To develop reliable data-driven models, however, a sound model training and evaluation procedures are needed. A crucial step in these procedures is the assessment of the model performance, with as key component the applied performance criterion. Therefore, we reviewed seven performance criteria commonly applied in presence-absence modelling (the correctly classified instances, Kappa, sensitivity, specificity, the normalised mutual information statistic, the true skill statistic and the odds ratio) and analysed their application in both the model training and evaluation process. Although estimates of predictive performance have been used widely to assess final model quality, a systematic overview was missing because most analyses of performance criteria have been empirical and only focused on specific aspects of the performance criteria. This paper provides such an overview showing that different performance criteria evaluate a model differently and that this difference may be explained by the dependency of these criteria on the prevalence of the validation set. We showed theoretically that these prevalence effects only occur if the data are inseparable by an n-dimensional hyperplane, n being the number of input variables. Given this inseparability, different performance criteria focus on different aspects of model performance during model training, such as sensitivity, specificity or predictive accuracy. These findings have important consequences for ecological modelling because ecological data are mostly inseparable due to data noise and the complexity of the studied system. Consequently, it should be very clear which aspect of the model performance is evaluated, and models should be evaluated consistently, that is, independent of, or taking into account, species prevalence. The practical implications of these findings are clear. They provide further insight into the evaluation of ecological presence/absence models and attempt to assist modellers in their choice of suitable performance criteria. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB Background: Whenever different data sets arrive at conflicting phylogenetic hypotheses, only testable causal explanations of sources of errors in at least one of the data sets allow us to critically choose among the conflicting hypotheses of relationships. The large (28S) and small (18S) subunit rRNAs are among the most popular markers for studies of deep phylogenies. However, some nodes supported by this data are suspected of being artifacts caused by peculiarities of the evolution of these molecules. Arthropod phylogeny is an especially controversial subject dotted with conflicting hypotheses which are dependent on data set and method of reconstruction. We assume that phylogenetic analyses based on these genes can be improved further i) by enlarging the taxon sample and ii) employing more realistic models of sequence evolution incorporating non-stationary substitution processes and iii) considering covariation and pairing of sites in rRNA-genes.
   Results: We analyzed a large set of arthropod sequences, applied new tools for quality control of data prior to tree reconstruction, and increased the biological realism of substitution models. Although the split-decomposition network indicated a high noise content in the data set, our measures were able to both improve the analyses and give causal explanations for some incongruities mentioned from analyses of rRNA sequences. However, misleading effects did not completely disappear.
   Conclusion: Analyses of data sets that result in ambiguous phylogenetic hypotheses demand for methods, which do not only filter stochastic noise, but likewise allow to differentiate phylogenetic signal from systematic biases. Such methods can only rely on our findings regarding the evolution of the analyzed data. Analyses on independent data sets then are crucial to test the plausibility of the results. Our approach can easily be extended to genomic data, as well, whereby layers of quality assessment are set up applicable to phylogenetic reconstructions in general.

AB To explore the evolutionary consequences of climate-induced fluctuations in presently fragmented temperate forest habitats in continental East Asia we investigated the phylogeography and demographic history of the temperate-deciduous forest endemic Dysosma versipellis from disjunct montane sites in Central-Southeast China. Based on a survey of chloroplast (cp) DNA sequence variation, our analyses show that this perennial herb consists of morphologically indistinguishable western and central/eastern cpDNA lineages. Coalescent analyses under the 'isolation with migration' (IM) model Support an ancient (Mid-Pleistocene) divergence between these lineages, with the western lineage having persisted without significant Population growth in a long-term refuge just east of the Tibetan (Qinghai-Xizang) Plateau. In contrast, for the central/eastern lineage, we found strong evidence for population expansion from a refuge located south of the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, and likely coinciding with the last or penultimate interglacial, followed by considerable Population isolation and divergence in situ over (at least) the latest glacial-interglacial cycle. In line with recent evidence from palaeomodeling of East Asian forest biomes, our results suggest that the same vicariance factor, i.e. climate-induced eco-geographic isolation through (a)biotic displacement of temperate-deciduous forested habitats, Promoted the divergence of D. versipellis lineages and populations at different spatial-temporal scales and over glacial and interglacial periods. Thus, there is no evidence that populations of D. versipellis merged at lower elevations during the last glacial(s). As Such, D. versipellis accords with the premise that Late Quaternary refugial isolation is likely to have enhanced allopatric (incipient) species formation of temperate plants in East Asia.

AB Conversion of land from natural to urban or agricultural cover degrades stream ecosystems and results in loss of biodiversity. We compared cumulative frequency distributions to measure responses to land use gradients for aquatic invertebrate taxa to agricultural, urban, and impervious surface cover gradients across the state of Maryland, USA. The technique identifies the upper limit threshold above which taxa cease to occur as well as a lower limit of detection of effect for negatively affected taxa. Urban development and impervious surface cover negatively affected the distributions of 44-56% of the 180 taxa tested, depending on region. Across similar taxa, negative responses occurred at lower levels of urban land covers in the Piedmont compared to the Coastal Plain physiographic province, which suggests that Piedmont aquatic biodiversity may be more vulnerable to urbanization. Most taxa were capable of tolerating high levels of agricultural development, although a number of common taxa in the Coastal Plain and Highlands regions were found to be agriculture-sensitive. Some taxa traditionally used as indicators were tolerant of very high levels of human-altered land uses, suggesting that such taxa require examination prior to use as indicators of landscape stressors. Our analysis method appears to be sufficiently flexible and sensitive to be used for a variety of taxa and systems for stressor detection, ecosystem monitoring, and spatially explicit forecasts of taxa loss as watershed land cover changes.

AB Extinctions are often the result of multiple factors that are difficult to disentangle and so methods for identifying simple and combined types of extinctions are valuable for both basic and applied ecology. We applied a modification of variance partitioning and a hierarchical partitioning analysis to test several hypotheses that attempt to explain the recent large-scale disappearance of Egyptian Vulture breeding territories in Spain. Our aim was to identify and then separate the simple (or pure) from the combined effects of habitat features, human pressure, and the social behavior of the species on the risk of extinction from a territory while controlling for spatial autocorrelation. Deviance partitioning showed that a complex mix of factors is significantly related to the disappearance of more than 400 territories throughout Spain. Abandoned territories were located in areas that are isolated from other conspecific territories and far from communal roost sites. In addition, these territories were found in places where there is a lack of natural habitats, high habitat fragmentation and reduced habitat diversity, and where food availability seems to be low and the illegal use of poison to control predators is a common practice. Deviance partitioning also showed an important spatial component in the probability of extinction. Abandoned territories were not randomly distributed; rather, they were aggregated in extinction 'hotspots', mainly related to food availability and human pressure. Deviance partitioning turned out to be an useful tool for identifying the relative contribution of a variety of factors - and their combined effects - associated with an extinction process. The deviance explained by each factor must be interpreted, however, in the context of a good knowledge of the life history of the species. Hierarchical partitioning can help rank conservation priorities and, by using as an objective criterion the relative weight of each independent variable that could be effectively managed for conservation, may provide wildlife managers with a means of saving funds and optimizing action plans.

TI Radiocarbon evidence of mid-Holocene mammoths stranded on an Alaskan

SO NATURE

DT Article
ID EXTINCTION
AB Island colonization and subsequent dwarfing of Pleistocene proboscideans is one of the more dramatic evolutionary and ecological occurrences(1-3), especially in situations where island populations survived end-Pleistocene extinctions whereas those on the nearby mainland did not(4). For example, Holocene mammoths have been dated from Wrangel Island in northern Russia(4). In most of these cases, few details are available about the dynamics of how island colonization and extinction occurred. As part of a large radiocarbon dating project of Alaskan mammoth fossils, I addressed this question by including mammoth specimens from Bering Sea islands known to have formed during the end-Pleistocene sea transgression(5). One date of 7,908 +/- 6 100 yr BP (radiocarbon years before present) established the presence of Holocene mammoths on St Paul Island, a first Holocene island record for the Americas. Four lines of evidence 265 accelerator mass spectrometer (AMS) radiocarbon dates from Alaskan mainland mammoths(6), 13 new dates from Alaskan island mammoths, recent reconstructions of bathymetric plots(5) and sea transgression rates from the Bering Sea(5)-made it possible to reconstruct how mammoths became stranded in the Pribilofs and why this apparently did not happen on other Alaskan Bering Sea islands.

AB Conservation of biological diversity under the natural disturbance model of boreal forest management relies on the assumption that natural mosaics of stand composition and structure can be adequately recreated through forest management activities. Maintaining compositional and structural features that provide adequate habitat for species within managed stands is the basis of coarse-filter conservation strategies. Here we test the effect of stand composition and stand structure on the epigaeic arthropod fauna from four boreal mixedwood cover types in western Canada. We observed differences in epigaeic community composition and species-specific associations among each of the four cover types. Differences in the carabid fauna between cover types were defined by relative abundance of carabid species associated specifically with moss cover, forb cover, and of coarse woody material, rather than unique, stand-specific species compositions of the overstory. Cover-type differences were less apparent among the comparatively species-rich spider assemblages largely because of their low abundance in undisturbed stands. For the effective conservation of all species, our results suggest that coarse-filter management of mixedwood boreal forests must incorporate structural features beyond overstory canopy composition. Our analyses also suggest that activities directed at managing the amount of coarse woody material on the ground and understory plant composition, perhaps through variable retention harvesting, is a logical first step.

AB We used the results of the Spanish Otter Survey of 1994-1996, a Geographic Information System and stepwise multiple logistic regression to model otter presence/absence data in the continental Spanish UTM 10 x 10-km squares. Geographic situation, indicators of human activity such as highways and major urban centers, and environmental variables related with productivity, water availability, altitude, and environmental energy were included in a logistic model that correctly classified about 73% of otter presences and absences. We extrapolated the model to the adjacent territory of Portugal, and increased the model's spatial resolution by extrapolating it to I x 1-km squares in the whole Iberian Peninsula. The model turned out to be rather flexible, predicting, for instance, the species to be very restricted to the courses of rivers in some areas, and more widespread in others. This allowed us to determine areas where otter populations may be more vulnerable to habitat changes or harmful human interventions. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB I experimentally examined the relative importance of a top predator in a three trophic level food chain in which the abiotic conditions were varied. Food chains consisting of plants, grasshoppers and wolf spiders were established in field cages placed over natural prairie. Grasshopper resource intake was manipulated by altering the abiotic environment (i.e., shading during peak grasshopper feeding times to reduce temperature and radiation), and thus the time they had available for feeding. Grasshoppers in control (unshaded) food chains compensated for spider predation by increased per capita survival and food consumption by those remaining. In this scenario, plant biomass was unaffected by the presence of spiders (i.e., no trophic cascade). However, when the grasshoppers were shaded for the morning hours, reducing their time available for feeding, spiders reduced grasshopper density, and the abundance of plants increased relative to when spiders were absent (i.e., a trophic cascade). This experiment showed that by simply altering the abiotic environment such that grasshopper foraging ability changed, profound differences in the impacts of top predators resulted.

AB Although larval supply is essential to the maintenance of many marine populations, relatively little is known about the processes influencing the supply of larvae to nearshore habitats. To measure the temporal and spatial patterns of larval supply to the island of Barbados, West Indies, an array of light traps was deployed at 3 sites along the west coast for 2 spring recruitment seasons (1991-92). Three replicate traps were deployed nightly at a central site, and 3 more traps were situated at both a northern and a southern site on alternate weeks during a 60 d period in 1991. In 1992, 3 replicate light traps were deployed nightly at each of the 3 sites for 70 d. A total of 82 species from 31 families was collected; collections from each year were dominated by species from several families: Atherinidae, Blennidae, Scaridae, Pomacentridae, and Acanthuridae. Temporal patterns of abundance were similar for the majority of the species collected: total larval abundance and diversity was greatest during the second half of the lunar cycle, peaking on the third quarter moon. Spatial patterns of larval supply were also distinct: the overall supply of larvae was typically lowest in the central region of the island. Supply of individual species was usually higher at one or the other or both ends of the west coast compared to the central site, with only 2 exceptions. Variation in the temporal and spatial pattern of tidal currents may account for patterns in the supply of ichthyoplankton. Temporal patterns of north-south (along shore) tidal flow were similar at all 3 sites: maximum nightly transport to the south occurred during maximum amplitude tides (during the new and full moons), while maximum nightly transport to the north occurred during minimum amplitude tides (during the quarter moons). East-west (onshore-offshore) transport due to tidal flows occurred on a much smaller scale and differed among sites. At the northern and southern sites, nightly transport by tidal currents was generally eastward, or onshore, while at the central site transport was generally west, or offshore. At both the southern and central sites in 1992, the temporal pattern of larval supply was significantly correlated to east-west transport by tidal currents integrated over the previous night. Onshore transport of larvae by tidal currents may be reduced at the central region of the west coast, resulting in both lower abundances and an overall lower diversity of reef fish larvae there. Patterns in the nightly transport by large-scale, externally forced currents (periods greater than 39 h) were generally similar across all sites. Transport by these currents in both the north-south and east-west directions was significantly correlated to the mean number of larvae collected by the light traps, suggesting some influence of external forcing such as wind or other oceanographic features. Thus, larval supply to Barbados appears to be influenced by processes occurring at 2 scales. Behavioral or passive synchronization to the lunar and tidal amplitude cycles results in regular, predictable peaks in the supply of late-stage larvae. Superimposed on this pattern are less predictable, large-scale events which can also greatly influence the nearshore transport of larvae.

AB A common observation in plants grown in elevated CO2 concentration is that the rate of photosynthesis is lower than expected from the dependence of photosynthesis upon CO2 concentration in single leaves of plants grown at present CO2 concentration. Furthermore, it has been suggested that this apparent down regulation of photosynthesis may be larger in leaves of plants at low nitrogen supply than at higher nitrogen supply. However, the available data are rather limited and contradictory. In this paper, particular attention is drawn to the way in which whole plant growth response to N supply constitutes a variable sink strength for carbohydrate usage and how this may affect photosynthesis. The need for further studies of the acclimation of photosynthesis at elevated CO2 in leaves of plants whose N supply has resulted in well-defined growth rate and sink activity is emphasised, and brief consideration is made of how this might be achieved.

AB Fennoscandian plant communities dominated by the evergreen dwarf shrub Empetrum hermaphroditum Hagerup appear to have negative effects on forest regeneration. Effects of water extracts of leaves of E. hermaphroditum on the development and nitrogen uptake by roots and mycorrhizae (Paxillus involutus Batsch (Fr.)) of Scots pine (Pinus silvestris L.) were studied in a greenhouse experiment. Among seedlings that did not receive E. hermaphroditum extract, mycorrhizal plants grew better than nonmycorrhizal plants and also had a higher shoot to root ratio. Nitrogen uptake per unit root length was 3 times faster in mycorrhizal plants. The uptake of nitrogen was 92 ng . day-1 per dichotomous tip as compared with 22 ng . day-1 per nondichotomous root tip (mycorrhizal plants had both dichotomous and nondichotomous tips, whereas uninoculated plants almost exclusively had nondichotomous tips). A low concentration of extract impaired nitrogen uptake in both mycorrhizal and nonmycorrhizal plants. Uptake per unit root length was reduced to one-third and one-tenth in mycorrhizal and nonmycorrhizal plants, respectively. Calculated per dichotomous tip per day, the uptake of nitrogen was reduced to only 0.9 ng. Additions of extract also retarded increases in root length and the numbers of root tips, although less markedly, but the percentage of dichotomous tips was more strongly reduced. Empetrum hermaphroditum extract also strongly inhibited the growth of Paxillus involutus on modified Melin-Norkrans agar medium. The spread of mycorrhizal infection (as indicated by the percentage of dichotomous tips) and uptake of nutrients by roots and mycorrhizae were more sensitive to the extract than seed germination and radicle growth, which were demonstrated to be affected under field conditions.

AB Direct effects of a red tide (Ptychodiscus brevis) outbreak on bay scallops Argopecten irradians concentricus in North Carolina, USA, from October 1987 to February 1988 were necessarily limited to the 2 generations then present (adults of the year-class fished in winter 1987-88 and their progeny harvested in 1988-89), yet the 3 subsequent year-classes of bay scallops (those fished in the 1989-90, 1990-91, and 1991-92 winter seasons) also have been extremely depressed. The fishery crashed to about 10 to 15 % of the recent (25 yr) historical average harvest: no recovery has yet begun. This inability to recover quickly along with evidence of a previous gradual (5 to 12 yr) though erratic recovery from low population size in the early 1970's implies that this scallop population may be recruitment-limited at low density. Sampling of adults in August just before spawning and of new recruits surviving until early December in both 1988 and 1989 revealed that recruitment was positively related to adult abundance. This relationship was assessed across 9 bay scallop grounds in North Carolina. Settlement onto spat collector bags deployed at these sites during early autumn also tended to follow the same patterns of adult and recruit abundance among sites in 1988 but not in 1989. Patterns of adult and recruit abundance were broadly coherent across water bodies, with densities in Core Sound high, Back Sound relatively low, and Bogue Sound extremely low. Compared to identical sampling conducted during 3 years just preceeding the red tide outbreak, average autumn recruitment rates of bay scallops for 1988 and 1989 were normal in Core Sound, about 29 % of normal in Back Sound, and about 5 % of normal in Bogue Sound. This pattern continues to conform to the documented pattern of immediate direct effects of the red tide. Changes in area of its seagrass habitat appear incapable of explaining the sound-specific pattern of bay scallop declines following the red tide. This coherence of population dynamics on a basin scale implies that the bay scallop may be recruitment-limited at low density by mesoscale or sound-wide abundance of spawning adults, creating lasting effects of the red tide propagated through basin-scale population inertia. Recruitment limitation for an exploited species would have important consequences for sustainability of harvest, if based on an effective stock-recruitment relationship, and may imply need for management intervention to enhance spawning stock within depleted basins.

AB Eucalyptus grandis trees were grown in plantations with and without added fertiliser to examine the effects of plant nutrition on photosynthesis and growth. Leaves were sampled from known locations within canopies of selected trees and leaf N and P concentrations were measured. Contour maps of N and P distributions were then produced for crowns of trees aged between 6 and 16 months. Gas exchange measurements on sample leaves were used to estimate parameters of a model of C3 photosynthesis as a function of leaf N and P concentrations. Linear relationships were obtained between model parameters and leaf N concentration, but P appeared to be present in excess, since no correlation was found with P concentration. Photosynthetic light response curves were calculated for model leaves with differing N concentrations. The curves show that optimal concentrations of N in leaves depend on mean levels of irradiance during growth.

AB Cultural ecosystem services (CES) refer to the nonmaterial benefits people obtain from ecosystems, and they have direct influence on quality of life. Although the concept of CES has been well accepted, they are rarely fully investigated. A significant barrier is the method for evaluating CES. This paper conducts a literature review of CES evaluation methods. Our aims are the following: to provide an overview of existing CES evaluation methods, to classify them, to analyze them, to highlight important challenges and to offer suggestions for future study. This study has reviewed 293 papers and identified 20 evaluation methods. To conclude, we (i) emphasize considering all CES categories. More specifically, consistent classification systems for CES and unambiguous descriptions of each category are needed; (ii) highlight a combination of methods to enable a better evaluation of CES and call for integrating monetary and non-monetary methods, which does not indicate merely adding the different parts but rather focusing on the interactions between these components, especially by means of deliberative, participatory and mapping techniques; (iii) encourage more stated preference methods, such as the Q-method and narratives, to evaluate neglected services; (iv) propose that in-depth study of CES evaluation process is required to improve evaluation accuracy.

AB Scientists have paid attention to the evaluation of the risk of ecosystem service degradation under rapid urbanization; yet the performance of the existing frameworks could be improved for tackling the challenges in the evaluation. In this study, a framework combining ecosystem service with ecosystem health as an assessing end point of ecological risk assessment was established. The framework was applied to investigate the way in which urbanization influences the ecosystem risk of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei urban agglomeration. Firstly, the decrease ratio of ecosystem service was mainly distributed in the range from 0 to 15%; the mean value of ecosystem health decreased from 0.402 10 0.311 from 2000 to 2010. The number of assessment units exhibiting risk degree grade I (the lowest risk degree grade) decreased by 7.03%, while the number of assessment units exhibiting risk degree grade V (the highest risk degree grade) increased by 1.61% from 2000 to 2010. The ratio of artificial surface should be controlled below 70%, based on the fitting model and for the purpose of resilience management. Overall, the analytical framework can comprehensively evaluate the impacts of complex practices in land-use planning on ecosystems. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Intraspecific variation is a major component of biodiversity, yet it has received relatively little attention from governmental and nongovernmental organizations, especially with regard to conservation plans and the management of wild species. This omission is ill-advised because phenotypic and genetic variations within and among populations can have dramatic effects on ecological and evolutionary processes, including responses to environmental change, the maintenance of species diversity, and ecological stability and resilience. At the same time, environmental changes associated with many human activities, such as land use and climate change, have dramatic and often negative impacts on intraspecific variation. We argue for the need for local, regional, and global programs to monitor intraspecific genetic variation. We suggest that such monitoring should include two main strategies: (i) intensive monitoring of multiple types of genetic variation in selected species and (ii) broad-brush modeling for representative species for predicting changes in variation as a function of changes in population size and range extent. Overall, we call for collaborative efforts to initiate the urgently needed monitoring of intraspecific variation.

ID FIRE; FOREST; VEGETATION; MODEL; MODIS
AB The occurrence of large, high-intensity wildfires requires plant biomass, or fuel, that is sufficiently dry to burn. This poses the question, what is "sufficiently dry"? Until recently, the ability to address this question has been constrained by the spatiotemporal scale of available methods to monitor the moisture contents of both dead and live fuels. Here we take advantage of recent developments in macroscale monitoring of fuel moisture through a combination of remote sensing and climatic modeling. We show there are clear thresholds of fuel moisture content associated with the occurrence of wildfires in forests and woodlands. Furthermore, we show that transformations in fuel moisture conditions across these thresholds can occur rapidly, within a month. Both the approach presented here, and our findings, can be immediately applied and may greatly improve fire risk assessments in forests and woodlands globally.

AB Photosynthesis in C-3 plants is significantly limited by mesophyll conductance (g(m)), which can vary with leaf anatomical traits and nitrogen (N) supplements. Several studies have investigated the response of g(m) to N supplements; however, none examined the implications of N supplements on the response of g(m) to rapid environmental changes. Here we investigated the effect of N supplement on g(m) and the response of g(m) to change of CO2, temperature and irradiance in rice. High N supplement (HN) increased mesophyll cell wall surface area and chloroplast surface area exposed to intercellular airspace per leaf area, and reduced cell wall thickness. These changes resulted in increased g(m). The g(m) of leaves with HN was more sensitive to changes in CO2 concentration, temperature and irradiance. The difference in leaf structural features between low N supplement and HN indicates that a rapid change in g(m) is related to the regulation of diffusion through biological membranes rather than leaf structural features. These results will contribute to an understanding of the determinants of g(m) response to rapid changes in environmental factors.

AB Significant changes have occurred in the well-established partnership between fisheries managers and geneticists over the last 50years. It is therefore timely to review and recalibrate the ways in which genetic technologies can assist the fishing industry to maintain productive and sustainable harvests. Our objective is to contribute to the mutual understanding of all stakeholders in the genetics-management partnership. Genetic technologies that are relevant to fisheries management are grouped into eleven themes, which are described in plain language for a non-specialist audience. The role that the genetic information plays in fisheries management is explained, along with an assessment of the challenges and barriers that may be preventing the uptake of the information into the fisheries management process. The compelling conclusion is that genetics offers a diverse collection of versatile and useful tools for informing fisheries managers about issues that have a biological basis. Presently, mainstream use of genetic tools focuses on a narrow set of fisheries management issues, but the diversity of genetic tools and the novel issues they can address indicates that uptake will grow, particularly as communication between geneticists and end-users improves.

AB The contribution of ecosystems to human well-being has been widely recognised. Taking into account existing trade-offs between ecosystem services (ES) at the farm scale and the dependence of multiple ES on processes that take place at the landscape scale, long-term preservation of multifunctional landscapes must be a priority. Studies carried out from such perspective, and those that develop appropriate indicators, could provide useful tools for integrating ES in landscape planning. In this study we propose a new integrative environmental indicator based on the ES provided by the landscape and named "multiple ecosystem services landscape index" (MESLI). Because synergies and trade-offs between ES are produced at regional or local levels, being different from those perceived at larger scales, MESLI was developed at municipality level. Furthermore, in order to identify main drivers of change in ES provision at the landscape scale an analysis of the relationship between the environmental and the socioeconomic characteristics of the municipalities was carried out. The study was located in the Basque Country and the results demonstrated that the MESLI index is a good tool to measure landscape multifunctionality at local scales. It is effective evaluating landscapes, distinguishing between municipalities based on ES provision, and identifying the drivers of change and their effects. This information about ES provisioning at the local level is usually lacking; therefore, MESLI would be very useful for policy-makers and land managers because it provides relevant information to local scale decision-making.

AB Studies of demographic processes are typically restricted to small geographic areas and short time periods due to the costs of marking and monitoring individuals. However, environmental changes are occurring at much broader spatial and temporal scales, and thus, inferences about the mechanisms governing population dynamics need to be scaled accordingly. Recently developed integrated population models (IPMs) represent an approach for doing so, by jointly analysing survey data and capture-recapture data. Although promising, several shortcomings of conventional IPMs exist, including difficulties accounting for spatial variation in demographic, movement and detection parameters; limited ability to make spatially explicit predictions of abundance or vital rates; and a requirement that the survey data and the capture-recapture data are independent. We demonstrate how each of these limitations can be resolved by adopting a spatial population dynamics model upon which both the survey data and the capture-recapture data are conditioned. We applied the model to 6 years of hair data collected on the threatened Louisiana black bear Ursus americanus luteolus. For years in which the hair samples were genotyped, the resulting data are information-rich (but expensive) spatial capture-recapture (SCR) data. For the remaining years, the data are binary detection data, of the type often analysed using occupancy models. We compared estimates of demographic parameters and annual abundance using various combinations of the SCR and detection data, and found that combining the SCR data and the detection data resulted in more precise estimates of abundance relative to estimates that did not use the detection data. A simulation study provided additional evidence of increased precision, as well as evidence that the estimators of annual abundance are approximately unbiased. The ability to combine survey data and capture-recapture data using a spatially explicit model opens many possibilities for designing cost effective studies and scaling up inferences about the demographic processes influencing spatial and temporal population dynamics.

AB Invasive species remain a major environmental problem in the world's oceans. Managing the vectors of introduction is the most effective means of mitigating this problem, but current risk assessments and management strategies are largely focused on species, not on vectors and certainly not on multiple simultaneous vectors. To highlight the issue that multiple vectors contribute to invasions, we analyzed the historical and contemporary contributions of eight maritime vectors to the establishment of nonindigenous species in California, where most species were associated with two to six vectors. Vessel biofouling looms larger than ballast water as a major vector and a management opportunity, but aquaculture risk appears reduced from historic levels. Standardized data on species abundances in each vector are lacking for a robust cross-vector assessment, which could be obtained in a proof-of-concept "vector blitz." Management must shift away from one or two target vectors to coordination across multiple vectors.

   TRAITS; GROWTH
AB In this era of rapidly urbanising human populations, urban practitioners are under increasing pressure to create resilient and sustainable cities and towns. Urban ecologists currently have a unique opportunity to apply solid, evidence-based research to help create biodiversity-rich and sustainable cities and towns for the future. Unfortunately, there is currently a mismatch between the questions planners, designers and decision-makers are asking urban ecologists that would allow them to improve the biodiversity outcomes in urban areas, and the questions urban ecologists must ask to contribute to the development and application of the science of urban ecology. For a number of reasons, urban ecologists over the past 25 years have primarily focused on describing the patterns of biodiversity in cities and towns using broad, aggregate predictor variables (e.g., distance to city center, land-use, percent cover of impermeable surfaces and vegetation, etc.). We refer to these results as 'low-hanging fruit'. If the discipline of urban ecology is going to provide the necessary information to inform actions to preserve and enhance urban biodiversity, we need to move beyond place-based research, and work towards the development of confirmed generalizations regarding the relationship between the structure and function of urban ecosystems and biodiversity. We propose three essential strategies for achieving this refined understanding: 1) defining the study window to place the study into a broader global context, 2) collecting and using more explicit question-driven measures of the urban condition in order to improve our understanding of urban ecological drivers, as well as recording more detailed ecological responses to provide insights into the ecological mechanisms underlying an observed response, and 3) expanding studies to include multiple cities, regions and countries. These strategies will help to expedite the ability of urban ecology to contribute to the creation of biodiversity-rich, healthy, resilient cities and towns.

AB Wildfires pose significant risks to people and human infrastructure worldwide. The treatment of fuel in landscapes may alter these risks but the magnitude of this effect on risk is poorly understood. Evidence from Australian Eucalyptus forests suggests that mitigation of risk using prescribed burning as a fuel treatment is partial because weather and fuel dynamics are conducive to regular high intensity fires. We further examine the response of risk to treatment in eucalypt forests using landscape simulation modelling. We model how five key measures of wildfire activity that govern risk to people and property may respond to variations in rate and spatial pattern of prescribed fire. We then model effects of predicted climate change (2050 scenarios) to determine how the response of risk to treatment is likely to be altered in the future. The results indicate that a halving of risk to people and property in these forests is likely to require treatment rates of 7-10% of the area of the landscape per annum. Projections of 2050 weather conditions under climate change further substantially diminished the effect of rate of treatment. A large increase in rates of treatment (i.e. circa. 50% over current levels) would be required to counteract these effects of climate change. Such levels of prescribed burning are unlikely to be financially feasible across eucalypt dominated vegetation in south eastern Australia. Despite policy imperatives to expand fuel treatment, a reduction rather than an elimination of risk will result. Multifaceted strategies will therefore be required for the management of risk.

TI Disregarding the edaphic dimension in species distribution models leads

AB Species distribution modelling is an easy, persuasive and useful tool for anticipating species distribution shifts under global change. Numerous studies have used only climate variables to predict future potential species range shifts and have omitted environmental factors important for determining species distribution. Here, we assessed the importance of the edaphic dimension in the niche-space definition of Quercus pubescens and in future spatial projections under global change over the metropolitan French forest territory. We fitted two species distribution models (SDM) based on presence/absence data (111 similar to 013 plots), one calibrated from climate variables only (mean temperature of January and climatic water balance of July) and the other one from both climate and edaphic (soil pH inferred from plants) variables. Future predictions were conducted under two climate scenarios (PCM B2 and HadCM3 A2) and based on 100 simulations using a cellular automaton that accounted for seed dispersal distance, landscape barriers preventing migration and unsuitable land cover. Adding the edaphic dimension to the climate-only SDM substantially improved the niche-space definition of Q. pubescens, highlighting an increase in species tolerance in confronting climate constraints as the soil pH increased. Future predictions over the 21st century showed that disregarding the edaphic dimension in SDM led to an overestimation of the potential distribution area, an underestimation of the spatial fragmentation of this area, and prevented the identification of local refugia, leading to an underestimation of the northward shift capacity of Q. pubescens and its persistence in its current distribution area. Spatial discrepancies between climate-only and climate-plus-edaphic models are strengthened when seed dispersal and forest fragmentation are accounted for in predicting a future species distribution area. These discrepancies highlight some imprecision in spatial predictions of potential distribution area of species under climate change scenarios and possibly wrong conclusions for conservation and management perspectives when climate-only models are used.

AB The use of molecular techniques is rapidly growing as the tools have become more diverse and powerful, more widely available, and easier to implement. Molecular analyses are able to elucidate information about target weeds that is critical to improving control success, such as taxonomic clarification, evidence of hybridization and cryptic species, better development of test plant lists, population structure and origin of invasions. Similarly, molecular approaches can improve our knowledge of biological control agents, providing taxonomic clarity, identification of immature arthropods and fungal pathogens, and description of genetic variability in agents. Molecular tools also allow easier identification of host associations and provide a tool for post-release evaluation and tracking of agents. This review provides an overview of how to use molecular approaches in biological control of weeds, with the aim of assisting the adoption and facilitating fruitful collaboration between scientists studying the biology and ecology of agents and their targets and those with skills using molecular approaches. We describe the current molecular techniques relevant to classical biological control of weeds, instruct how to collect field materials for molecular analyses, and give recent examples of the use of molecular methods in biological control of weeds, with comments on the most appropriate methods for analysis of molecular data.

AB The ecosystem services concept is used in different scientific disciplines and is spreading into policy and business circles to draw attention to the benefits that people receive from biodiversity and ecosystems. However, the concept remains multiform and is used interchangeably with a range of other terms such as ecological, landscape or environmental services. We argue that lexical differences, in fact, result from different understandings of the concept, which could slow its use in nature conservation or sustainable resource use. An application to semi-natural grasslands shows that such differences could lead to very different assessments, of quality, quantity and location of ecosystem services. We argue that a compromise must be found between a broad and simple definition, which is useful for communicating the concept and large-scale policies, and a more refined definition for research and implementation goals such as environmental management and national and international assessments and accounting.

AB Molecular phylogeographic studies have recently begun to elucidate how plant species from the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) and adjacent regions responded to the Quaternary climatic oscillations. In this regard, however, far less attention has been paid to the southern and south-eastern declivities of the QTP, i.e. the Himalaya-Hengduan Mountains (HHM) region. Here, we report a survey of amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs) and chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) sequence variation in the HHM endemic Sinopodophyllum hexandrum, a highly selfing alpine perennial herb with mainly gravity-dispersed berries (105 individuals, 19 localities). We specifically aimed to test a vicariant evolutionary hypothesis across the 'Mekong-Salween Divide', a known biogeographic and phytogeographic boundary of north-to-south trending river valleys separating the East Himalayas and Hengduan Mts. Both cpDNA and AFLPs identified two divergent phylogroups largely congruent with these mountain ranges. There was no genetic depauperation in the more strongly glaciated East Himalayas (AFLPs: H-E = 0.031; cpDNA: h(s) = 0.133) compared to the mainly ice-free Hengduan Mts. (AFLPs: H-E = 0.037; cpDNA: h(s) = 0.082), while population differentiation was consistently higher in the former region (AFLPs: Phi(ST) = 0.522 vs. 0.312; cpDNA: Phi(ST) = 0.785 vs. 0.417). Our results suggest that East Himalayan and Hengduan populations of S. hexandrum were once fragmented, persisted in situ during glacials in both areas, and have not merged again, except for a major instance of inter-lineage chloroplast capture identified at the MSD boundary. Our coalescent time estimate for all cpDNA haplotypes (c. 0.37-0.48 mya), together with paleogeological evidence, strongly rejects paleo-drainage formation as a mechanism underlying allopatric fragmentation, whereas mountain glaciers following the ridges of the MSD during glacials (and possible interglacials) could have been responsible. This study thus indicates an important role for mountain glaciers in driving (incipient) allopatric speciation across the MSD in the HHM region by causing vicariant lineage divergence and acting as barriers to post-divergence gene flow.

AB Changes in community structure and life-history traits of benthic invertebrates were examined along a longitudinal intermittence gradient in an alluvial river. The gradient was characterized with modeled and measured hydrologic, chemical, and physical environmental variables. The invertebrates were collected in the Selwyn River, southeastern New Zealand, at multiple sites in each of 4 river sections with distinct hydrological conditions (perennial-losing, ephemeral, intermittent, perennial-gaining). Values of hydrological metrics for each site were generated with an empirical model developed for the Selwyn River. The metrics included 4 that characterized intermittent flow (flow permanence, flow duration, drying frequency, distance to nearest perennial site). Most invertebrate richness and density metrics were significantly higher in the perennial-losing and perennial-gaining sections than in the ephemeral and intermittent sections. A principle components analysis (PCA) separated invertebrate samples from the 4 sections along 2 primary factors. Nine of 13 hydrological metrics, including the 4 intermittence metrics, were correlated with the PCA site scores. Linear regressions indicated that most taxon-richness metrics and some density metrics were related to flow permanence, flow duration, or both. Based on the regression analysis, we predicted that 1.9 taxa/m(2) are added with each 10% increase in flow permanence, and 0.5 taxa/m(2) are added with each 10-d increase in flow duration. Results from a nestedness analysis indicated that communities at ephemeral and intermittent sites were nested subsets of the communities at perennial sites, and the nesting order of sites was related to both flow permanence and flow duration. Assemblages of taxa with particular life-history traits (life span, fecundity, maximum size, and voltinism) varied linearly with flow permanence and flow duration. The variation in invertebrate communities along the Selwyn River was primarily the result of progressive removal of desiccation-sensitive taxa with increasing intermittence, not to selection for desiccation-resistant specialists. Quantitative intermittence ecology relationships are needed to predict the consequences of future changes in flow intermittence, but such relationships are rare. The univariate relationships reported in our study contribute to a small but growing array of intermittence ecology relationships.

AB This paper provides a comprehensive review of ecosystem services and their economic valuation in China. The main objective of this review is to introduce the findings of the various valuation studies, and explore the challenges that emerged in these studies. This paper shows that ecosystem services research in China went through four stages covering all the main ecosystem types and multi-scales. These studies have raised public awareness of the value of ecological and bio-resource issues, and promoted the establishment of eco-compensation mechanisms in China. However, there are still many controversies and challenges that have emerged from current ecosystem services research. We propose that future ecosystem services research focuses on i) the corresponding definition and classification systems for all ecosystems; ii) the observation and establishment of the relationship between ecosystem structures and corresponding functions; iii) the improvement and normalization of valuation methods; and iv) the exploration and analysis of the spatial and temporal variations of ecosystem services. Furthermore, it is important to improve the accessibility of ecosystem services valuation in environmental decision-making. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Mediterranean rivers are characterized by frequent hydrological disturbances, including floods, droughts, and human impacts like water abstraction. During 2008 an exceptionally long drought in NE Spain was irregularly interrupted by rainfall events. We analyzed the relationships between the biological community structure with the ongoing and preceding hydrological patterns during the drought and recovery periods. We aimed: (1) to assess the role of hydrology on different biological assemblages (diatoms, macroinvertebrates and fish), (2) to determine which measures of community structure could be better related to hydrology, and (3) to determine the effects of water abstraction on river communities. Three subsets of variables (hydrological, spatial and environmental) were selected to determine the relative importance of hydrological alterations. Variation partitioning analysis and ordination methods were used to determine which subset of variables had higher effects on 20 parameters and six matrices (taxonomic and functional) of the biological communities. The analyses revealed that both parameters and matrices were significantly related to hydrological effects. Reservoirs intensified the effect of drought on downstream community composition and structure, as a result of the competition between human uses of water and environmental values.

AB The Nature Conservancy takes a strategic and systematic approach to conservation planning. Ecoregional assessments are used to set goals and identify geographical priorities, and Conservation Action Planning is used to develop strategic plans for conservation areas. This study demonstrates how these planning processes were applied at the seascape scale based on a case study of Kimbe Bay, Papua New Guinea. Conservation Action Planning was used to identify key threats and strategies, and systematic conservation planning (similar to that used for ecoregional assessments) was used to design a network of marine protected areas to be resilient to the threat of climate change. The design was based on an assessment of biodiversity and socio-economic values, and identified 14 Areas of Interest that meet specific conservation goals. A detailed community-based planning process is now underway with local communities that own and manage these areas to refine and implement the marine protected area network.

AB 1. Spatial subsidies, defined as the flow of energy, nutrients, organisms or pollutants from one habitat to another, have been shown to affect the food-web dynamics in a wide range of ecosystems. An important subsidy to riparian communities is the contribution of adult stream insects to terrestrial predators such as birds, bats and lizards, but also invertebrates including ground and web-building spiders.
   2. We surveyed 37 first- and second-order forest streams across differing environmental gradients in the Central South Island, New Zealand, to investigate the relationship between potential aquatic prey subsidies and predatory riparian arachnids. We anticipated that stream-insect biomass would be positively associated with riparian arachnids, as a result of emergent adult aquatic insect subsidies to the adjacent habitat.
   3. We confirmed positive associations between stream-insect biomass as a predictor variable and riparian arachnid biomass (R-2 = 0.42, F-1,F-34 = 25.2, P < 0.001) and web densities (R-2 = 0.45, F-1,F-14 = 11.5, P < 0.01) respectively as dependent variables after adjusting for the confounding effects of environmental variables. Hierarchical partitioning confirmed the importance of stream insect biomass as a statistically significant contributor to the total explained variance in analyses calculated for arachnid biomass, abundance and web density.
   4. A concurrent survey of spider-web density along 20-m transects from the stream edge into the forest indicated a strong decline in web-building spider density moving away from the stream (R-2 = 0.41, F-1,F-158 = 109, P < 0.001), with stream-insect biomass as a significant covariate (F-1,F-149 = 17.7, P < 0.001).
   5. Our results suggest that productivity gradients present in the donor system affect the magnitude of the interaction between adjacent habitats. Productivity gradients may lead to increased reciprocal subsidies through a positive feedback loop involving the predation of spiders and other predatory terrestrial invertebrates by aquatic predators. However, terrestrial insectivores such as birds, bats and lizards that are not readily used as prey by aquatic predators may circumvent the feedback cycle by consuming a large proportion of emergent aquatic-insect biomass. This may lead to asymmetry in the strength of food-web linkages between aquatic and terrestrial habitats.

AB Fishermen's local knowledge of fishing resources may be an important source of information to improve artisanal tropical fisheries management, such as those found in Brazil, where most data on fish biology is lacking. We aim to study the local ecological knowledge that Brazilian coastal fishers have about reproductive aspects (season, places and migration) of 13 coastal fish species of commercial importance. We selected fishermen with more than 30 years of fishing practice and we interviewed a total of 67 fishermen: 29 from the southeastern coast, from the communities of Puruba, Almada, Picinguaba and Bertioga, and 38 from the northeastern coast, from the communities of Valenca, Arembepe and Porto Saui-pe. In the interviews, we used standardized questionnaires and showed photos of fish species. Our results indicate some general patterns in fishes' reproduction according to fishermen knowledge: fish species spawn in open ocean, near reefs or in coastal rivers (estuaries); some fishes reproduce during the summer and others in winter, while some have more defined spawning months. The main fish migratory patterns mentioned by interviewees were: long migrations along the coast, usually in the South to North direction, short migrations among reefs, fishes that do not migrate, migrations between the shore and open ocean and migrations between the sea and coastal rivers. Fishermen's knowledge differed among fish species: most fishermen did not know spawning places or seasons of large pelagic fishes, which raised concerns of their possible depletion. We compared such ethnoichthyological information with available scientific data, indicating promising insights about reproduction and migration of Brazilian coastal fishes. Data gathered from local fishermen may provide inexpensive and prompt information, potentially applicable to fisheries management. Our approach might be useful to several other small-scale fisheries, especially the tropical ones, where there is a high diversity of target species and a low biological and ecological knowledge about these species.

AB For protected reserves set aside for conservation, the impact of roads and traffic on wildlife can be severe, particularly for those in the peri-urban environment. Often reserves possess many sealed roads that have regular traffic from tourists and local residents. As managerial bodies struggle to control the wide variety of threats to the fauna within these reserves, the loss of life on roads only compounds the precarious nature of wildlife survival in these disturbed environments. As a first step to addressing this concern in Australia, this study quantifies the fatalities of wildlife killed on roads within the Royal National Park in New South Wales, and estimates those wildlife species using roadside habitat in order to identify species susceptible to collisions. Modelling of fatality data indicated that mammals were most likely to be killed where forage was abundant on the roadside verge and where there was plenty of protective cover, while birds were most likely to be killed when the height of roadside vegetation was low. A number of collision hotspots were identified along the surveyed road that should be the target of mitigation efforts. The average speed of vehicles travelling within the park peaked at night. This is of particular concern as activity by Australian mammals tends to be greatest at night. The findings indicate that roads in periurban reserves have the potential to alter the movement of animals and impact on their populations through loss of life. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Computer simulations were used to investigate population conditions under which phylogeographic breaks in gene genealogies can be interpreted with confidence to infer the existence and location of historical barriers to gene flow in continuously distributed, low-dispersal species. We generated collections of haplotypic gene trees under a variety of demographic scenarios and analyzed them with regard to salient genealogical breaks in their spatial patterns. In the first part of the analysis, we estimated the frequency in which the spatial location of the deepest phylogeographic break between successive pairs of populations along a linear habitat coincided with a spatial physical barrier to dispersal. Results confirm previous reports that individual gene trees can show 'haphazard' phylogeographic discontinuities even in the absence of historical barriers to gene flow. In the second part of the analysis, we assessed the probability that pairs of gene genealogies from a set of population samples agree upon the location of a geographical barrier. Our findings extend earlier reports by demonstrating that spatially concordant phylogeographic breaks across independent neutral loci normally emerge only in the presence of longstanding historical barriers to gene flow. Genealogical concordance across multiple loci thus becomes a deciding criterion by which to distinguish between stochastic and deterministic causation in accounting for phylogeographic discontinuities in continuously distributed species.

The stress axis plays a central role in these adaptations and I discuss the range of solutions that birds and mammals have evolved. The stress response in these animals is not static when a challenge occurs, but may be modulated depending on the biological function during the annual cycle (breeding versus nonbreeding), either under-responding to permit reproduction (some song birds) or responding vigorously, yet not having this compromise reproduction (Arctic ground squirrels). Both may trade off survival for reproduction. In contrast, the snowshoe hare shows the expected stress response to chronic high predation risk over 2-3 years: body resources are geared to survival and reproduction is inhibited. Two long term, persistent, and pervasive changes will confront northern birds and mammals in the 21(st) century: global change and persistent organochlorine pollutants (POPs). These may result in either adaptations or shifts in distribution and abundance. For the former, latitudinal variation in the stress axis may help song birds respond rapidly; population variation in the stress axis response is unknown in northern mammals and relatively sedentary mammals may be unable to shift their distribution rapidly to adjust major climate shifts. For the latter, the few POPs studies that have examined the stress axis indicate marked negative effects.

AB Leaf anatomical and chemical characteristics. water relations and stomatal regulation were studied in the shrub Myrtus communis growing under two contrasting Mediterranean light environments (full light versus 30% of full light) during the spring-summer period. These studies aimed to assess plant response to the combined effects of light and water availability. Foliar morphology, anatomy and chemistry composition acclimated positively to light conditions. Leaves of sun-exposed plants were thicker (38.7%) than those of shaded plants. mainly due to increased palisade parenchyma thickness. had a higher nitrogen concentration and stomatal density than the shade ones, which maximized foliar area (> SLA) and Chl/N molar ratio to improve light interception. Chlorophyll concentration per leaf area (Chl(a)) was always higher in jun Leaves while. as expressed on dry mass (Chl(m)), significant differences were only apparent in September. shade leaves presenting higher values. During the summer period Chl(a). and Chl(m), markedly declined in sun leaves and remained unchanged in shade ones. The ratio of chlorophyll alb was not affected either by the light intensity or by the season. Shade leaves presented generally a higher concentration of soluble carbohydrates per dry mass. No significant differences in starch concentration were apparent between sun and shade leaves and a gradual depiction occurred during the water stress period. Maximum stomatal conductances correlated positively with predawn water potential. Throughout the season. sun plants always presented higher leaf conductance to water vapour and lower minimum leaf water potentials. indicating an interaction of light-environment on these water relation parameters. Stomatal closure constitutes a mechanism to cope with diurnal and seasonal water deficits. sun plants presenting a more efficient control of water losses during water deficiency period. In addition, both sun and shade plants evidenced leaf osmotic adjustment ability in response to water stress, which was greater in sunones. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB To assess the spatial distribution of photosynthetic capacity within an isolated 20-year-old walnut tree (Juglans regia L.) crown, the distribution of relevant leaf characteristics was measured. Variations in leaf dry weight per area (W-a), and nitrogen concentration on a weight (N-w) and area basis (N-a), were studied in relation to solar irradiance along one vertical and two horizontal transects, on July 30 and September 3. In addition, the concentrations of total nonstructural carbon on a weight (TNCw) and area basis (TNCa) were measured on July 30. Concurrently, the spatial distribution of daily integrated leaf irradiance within the crown was simulated by a three-dimensional radiation transfer model over a one-week period before sampling at each date. Within the crown, high spatial heterogeneity was observed for W-a (from 50 to 140 g m(-2)), TNCa (from 4 to 17 g m(-2)) and N-a (from 1.2 to 3.6 g m(-2)). Although TNCw and N-w were not correlated and only weakly correlated to daily leaf irradiance, respectively, W-a, TNCa and N-a were strongly correlated to daily leaf irradiance. The relationship between observed N-a and simulated daily leaf irradiance was used to assess the spatial distribution of N-a within the crown at each date. Total leaf nitrogen in the foliage was estimated to be 339 g in late July and 317 g in early September. For the whole crown (i.e., 1729 current-year shoots), N-a increased strongly with basal shoot diameter (an index of shoot "vigor"), highlighting the fact that large shoots were mainly located in sunlit locations and exhibited high photosynthetic capacity.

AB Estimation of leaf photosynthetic rate (A) from leaf nitrogen content (N) is both conceptually and numerically important in models of plant, ecosystem, and biosphere responses to global change. The relationship between A and N has been studied extensively at ambient CO2 but much less at elevated CO2. This study was designed to (i) assess whether the A-N relationship was more similar for species within than between community and vegetation types, and (ii) examine how growth at elevated CO2 affects the A-N relationship. Data were obtained for 39 C3 species grown at ambient CO2 and 10 C3 species grown at ambient and elevated CO2. A regression model was applied to each species as well as to species pooled within different community and vegetation types. Cluster analysis of the regression coefficients indicated that species measured at ambient CO2 did not separate into distinct groups matching community or vegetation type. Instead, most community and vegetation types shared the same general parameter space for regression coefficients. Growth at elevated CO2 increased photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency for pines and deciduous trees. When species were pooled by vegetation type, the A-N relationship for deciduous trees expressed on a leaf-mass basis was not altered by elevated CO2, while the intercept increased for pines. When regression coefficients were averaged to give mean responses for different vegetation types, elevated CO2 increased the intercept and the slope for deciduous trees but increased only the intercept for pines. There were no statistical differences between the pines and deciduous trees for the effect of CO2. Generalizations about the effect of elevated CO2 on the A-N relationship, and differences between pines and deciduous trees will be enhanced as more data become available.

AB The phylogenetic relationships of the African lungfish (Protopterus dolloi) and the coelacanth (Latimeria chalumnae) with respect to tetrapods were analyzed using complete mitochondrial genome DNA sequences. A lungfish + coelacanth clade was favored by maximum parsimony (although this result is dependent on which transition: transversion weights are applied), and a lungfish + tetrapod clade was supported by neighbor-joining and maximum-likelihood analyses. These two hypotheses received the strongest statistical and bootstrap support to the exclusion of the third alternative, the coelacanth + tetrapod sister group relationship. All mitochondrial protein coding genes combined favor a lungfish + tetrapod grouping. We can confidently reject the hypothesis that the coelacanth is the closest living relative of tetrapods. When the complete mitochondrial sequence data were combined with nuclear 28S rRNA gene data, a lungfish + coelacanth clade was supported by maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood, but a lungfish + tetrapod clade was favored by neighbor-joining. The seemingly conflicting results based on different data sets and phylogenetic methods were typically not statistically strongly supported based on Kishino-Hasegawa and Templeton tests, although they were often supported by strong bootstrap values. Differences in rate of evolution of the different mitochondrial genes (slowly evolving genes such as the cytochrome oxidase and tRNA genes favored a lungfish + coelacanth clade, whereas genes of relatively faster substitution rate, such as several NADH dehydrogenase genes, supported a lungfish + tetrapod grouping), as well as the rapid radiation of the lineages back in the Devonian, rather than base compositional biases among taxa seem to be directly responsible for the remaining uncertainty in accepting one of the two alternate hypotheses.

AB Sequence differences in the tRNA-proline (tRNA(pro)) end of the mitochondrial control-region of three species of Pacific butterflyfishes accumulated 33-43 times more rapidly than did changes within the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene (cytb). Rapid evolution in this region was accompanied by strong transition/transversion bias and large variation in the probability of a DNA substitution among sites. These substitution constraints placed an absolute ceiling on the magnitude of sequence divergence that could be detected between individuals. This divergence ''ceiling'' was reached rapidly and led to a decay in the relative rate of control-region/cyt b b evolution. A high rate of evolution in this section of the control-region of butterflyfishes stands in marked contrast to the patterns reported in some other fish lineages. Although the mechanism underlying rate variation remains unclear, all taxa with rapid evolution in the 5'-end of the control-region showed extreme transition biases. By contrast, in taxa with slower control-region evolution, transitions accumulated at nearly the same rate as transversions. More information is needed to understand the relationship between nucleotide bias and the rate of evolution in the 5'-end of the control-region.
   Despite strong constraints on sequence change, phylogenetic information was preserved in the group of recently differentiated species and supported the clustering of sequences into three major mtDNA groupings. Within these groups, very similar control-region sequences were widely distributed across the Pacific Ocean and were shared between recognized species, indicating a lack of mitochondrial sequence monophyly among species.

AB To determine the effects of salinity on relative growth rate (RGR), net assimilation rate on a leaf weight basis (NAR(w)), leaf weight ratio (LWR), and nutrient uptake and utilization of citrus, we grew four citrus rootstocks (sour orange, Cleopatra mandarin, Carrizo citrange and Citrus macrophylla) in nutrient solutions containing 0, 10, 20, 40 or 80 mM NaCl for 20, 40 or 60 days. For each element analyzed, specific absorption rate (SAR) and specific utilization rate on a leaf basis (SUR(L)) were calculated for the period between Days 40 and 60. Relative growth rate decreased with time for all treatments and rootstocks. Salt treatment significantly reduced both RGR and NAR(w), whereas LWR showed no definite trend. In all rootstocks, NAR(w), but not LWR, was significantly correlated with RGR, indicating that NAR(w) was an important factor underlying the salinity-induced differences in RGR among the citrus rootstocks. At Day 60, salinity had a significant effect on leaf concentrations of Cl, Na, K, Ca, Mg, P, Fe, Mn and Zn and on the SAR and SUR(L) of most elements. In general, RGR was correlated with SAR and SUR(L). Therefore, in addition to osmotic effects and the inhibitory effects of high concentrations of Cl- and Na+, an imbalance of essential nutrients may also contribute to the reduction in plant growth under saline conditions.

AB Changes in needle nitrogen and resin acid concentrations in young Scots pine trees fertilized with ammonium nitrate were followed over 3 years. Sawfly larvae (Neodiprion sertifer) were reared on fertilized and control trees the year after fertilization. Both nitrogen and resin acid concentrations increased in fertilized trees. The fact that resin acid concentrations increased contradicts predictions of the carbon/nutrient balance hypothesis. We suggest that needle resin-acid concentrations are limited more by the size of the resin ducts than by the avilability of substrate for resin acid synthesis, and that the formation of resin ducts is limited by the availability of nitrogen. A modification of the carbon/nutrient balance hypothesis, relating compartment formation to allelochemical synthesis, is discussed. Performance of sawfly larvae was not affected by fertilization treatment, probably because concentrations of nitrogen (positively affecting performance) and resin acids (adversely affecting performance) increased simultaneously in fertilized trees. Thus, the results of this study do not support the notion that fertilization increases the resistance of trees to needle-eating insects.

AB In focusing on how organisms' generalizable functional properties (traits) interact mechanistically with environments across spatial scales and levels of biological organization, trait-based approaches provide a powerful framework for attaining synthesis, generality and prediction. Trait-based research has considerably improved understanding of the assembly, structure and functioning of plant communities. Further advances in ecology may be achieved by exploring the trait-environment relationships of non-sessile, heterotrophic organisms such as terrestrial arthropods, which are geographically ubiquitous, ecologically diverse, and often important functional components of ecosystems. Trait-based studies and trait databases have recently been compiled for groups such as ants, bees, beetles, butterflies, spiders and many others; however, the explicit justification, conceptual framework, and primary-evidence base for the burgeoning field of 'terrestrial arthropod trait-based ecology' have not been well established. Consequently, there is some confusion over the scope and relevance of this field, as well as a tendency for studies to overlook important assumptions of the trait-based approach. Here we aim to provide a broad and accessible overview of the trait-based ecology of terrestrial arthropods. We first define and illustrate foundational concepts in trait-based ecology with respect to terrestrial arthropods, and justify the application of trait-based approaches to the study of their ecology. Next, we review studies in community ecology where trait-based approaches have been used to elucidate how assembly processes for terrestrial arthropod communities are influenced by niche filtering along environmental gradients (e.g. climatic, structural, and land-use gradients) and by abiotic and biotic disturbances (e.g. fire, floods, and biological invasions). We also review studies in ecosystem ecology where trait-based approaches have been used to investigate biodiversity-ecosystem function relationships: how the functional diversity of arthropod communities relates to a host of ecosystem functions and services that they mediate, such as decomposition, pollination and predation. We then suggest how future work can address fundamental assumptions and limitations by investigating trait functionality and the effects of intraspecific variation, assessing the potential for sampling methods to bias the traits and trait values observed, and enhancing the quality and consolidation of trait information in databases. A roadmap to guide observational trait-based studies is also presented. Lastly, we highlight new areas where trait-based studies on terrestrial arthropods are well positioned to advance ecological understanding and application. These include examining the roles of competitive, non-competitive and (multi-)trophic interactions in shaping coexistence, and macro-scaling trait-environment relationships to explain and predict patterns in biodiversity and ecosystem functions across space and time. We hope this review will spur and guide future applications of the trait-based framework to advance ecological insights from the most diverse eukaryotic organisms on Earth.

AB The secondary xylem of woody plants transports water mechanically supports the plant body and stores resources. These three functions are interdependent giving rise to tradeoffs in function. Understanding the relationships among these functions and their structural basis forms the context in which to interpret xylem evolution. The tradeoff between xylem transport efficiency and safety from cavitation has been carefully examined with less focus on other functions, particularly storage. Here, we synthesize data on all three xylem functions in angiosperm branch xylem in the context of tradeoffs. Species that have low safety and efficiency, examined froma resource economics perspective, are predicted to be adapted for slow resource acquisition and turnover as characterizes some environments. Tradeoffs with water storage primarily arise because of differences in fibre traits, while tradeoffs in carbohydrate storage are driven by parenchyma content of tissue. We find support for a tradeoff between safety from cavitation and storage of both water and starch in branch xylem tissue and between water storage capacity and mechanical strength. Living fibres may facilitate carbohydrate storage without compromising mechanical strength. The division of labour between different xylem cell types allows for considerable functional and structural diversity at multiple scales.

AB Soil microbial communities are the key drivers of many terrestrial biogeochemical processes. However, we currently lack a generalizable understanding of how these soil communities will change in response to predicted increases in global temperatures and which microbial lineages will be most impacted. Here, using high-throughput marker gene sequencing of soils collected from 18 sites throughout North America included in a 100-day laboratory incubation experiment, we identified a core group of abundant and nearly ubiquitous soil microbes that shift in relative abundance with elevated soil temperatures. We then validated and narrowed our list of temperature-sensitive microbes by comparing the results from this laboratory experiment with data compiled from 210 soils representing multiple, independent global field studies sampled across spatial gradients with a wide range in mean annual temperatures. Our results reveal predictable and consistent responses to temperature for a core group of 189 ubiquitous soil bacterial and archaeal taxa, with these taxa exhibiting similar temperature responses across a broad range of soil types. These microbial ` bioindicators' are useful for understanding how soil microbial communities respond to warming and to discriminate between the direct and indirect effects of soil warming on microbial communities. Those taxa that were found to be sensitive to temperature represented a wide range of lineages and the direction of the temperature responses were not predictable from phylogeny alone, indicating that temperature responses are difficult to predict from simply describing soil microbial communities at broad taxonomic or phylogenetic levels of resolution. Together, these results lay the foundation for a more predictive understanding of how soil microbial communities respond to soil warming and how warming may ultimately lead to changes in soil biogeochemical processes.

AB AimPresence-only datasets represent an important source of information on species' distributions. Collections of presence-only data, however, are often spatially biased, particularly along roads and near urban populations. These biases can lead to inaccurate inferences and predicted distributions. We demonstrate a new approach of accounting for effort bias in presence-only data by explicitly incorporating sample biases in species distribution modelling.
   LocationAlberta, Canada.
   MethodsFirst, we used logistic regression to model sampling effort of recorded rare vascular plants, bryophytes and butterflies in Alberta. Second, we simulated presence/absence data for nine virtual' species based on three relative occurrence thresholds - common, rare and very rare - for each taxonomic group. We sampled these virtual species using our bias model to represent typical sampling effort characteristic of presence-only datasets. We then modelled the distributions of these virtual species using logistic regression and attempted to recover their original simulated distributions using a sample weighting term (prior weight) estimated as the inverse of probability of sampling. Bias-adjusted model estimates were compared to those obtained from random samples and biased samples without adjustment. We also compared prior-weight adjustment to bias-file and target-group background approaches in Maxent.
   ResultsSample weighting recovered regression coefficients and mapped predictions estimated from unbiased presence-only data and improved model predictive accuracy as evaluated by regression and correlation coefficients, sensitivity and specificity. Similar model improvements were achieved using the Maxent bias-file method, but results were inconsistent for the target-group background approach.
   Main conclusionsThese results suggest that sample weighting can be used to account for spatially biased presence-only datasets in species distribution modelling. The framework presented is potentially widely applicable due to availability of online biodiversity databases and the flexibility of the approach.

AB Quantifying shark distribution patterns and species-specific habitat associations in response to geographic and environmental drivers is critical to assessing risk of exposure to fishing, habitat degradation, and the effects of climate change. The present study examined shark distribution patterns, species-habitat associations, and marine reserve use with baited remote underwater video stations (BRUVS) along the entire Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (GBRMP) over a ten year period. Overall, 21 species of sharks from five families and two orders were recorded. Grey reef Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos, silvertip C. albimarginatus, tiger Galeocerdo cuvier, and sliteye Loxodon macrorhinus sharks were the most abundant species (>64% of shark abundances). Multivariate regression trees showed that hard coral cover produced the primary split separating shark assemblages. Four indicator species had consistently higher abundances and contributed to explaining most of the differences in shark assemblages: C. amblyrhynchos, C. albimarginatus, G. cuvier, and whitetip reef Triaenodon obesus sharks. Relative distance along the GBRMP had the greatest influence on shark occurrence and species richness, which increased at both ends of the sampling range (southern and northern sites) relative to intermediate latitudes. Hard coral cover and distance across the shelf were also important predictors of shark distribution. The relative abundance of sharks was significantly higher in non-fished sites, highlighting the conservation value and benefits of the GBRMP zoning. However, our results also showed that hard coral cover had a large effect on the abundance of reef-associated shark species, indicating that coral reef health may be important for the success of marine protected areas. Therefore, understanding shark distribution patterns, species-habitat associations, and the drivers responsible for those patterns is essential for developing sound management and conservation approaches.

AB Characterising a species' geographical extent is central to many conservation assessments, including those of the IUCN Red List of threatened species. The IUCN recommends that extent of occurrence (EOO) to be quantified by drawing a minimum convex polygon (MCP) around known or inferred presence localities. EOO calculated from verified specimens is commonly used in Red List assessments when other data are scarce, as is the case for many threatened plant species. Yet rarely do these estimates incorporate inferred localities from species distribution models (SDMs). A key impediment stems from uncertainty about how SDM predictions relate to EOO. Here we address this issue by comparing the EOOs estimated from specimen localities with EOOs derived from SDMs for plant species occurring in Costa Rica and Panama. We first analyse 20 plant species, with well-known and well-sampled distributions, and train SDMs to subsamples of the data and assess how well the SDM-derived MCPs predict both the MCPs of the subsamples and the MCPs of the complete dataset. We find that when sample sizes are small (5 or 10 samples) the SDM-derived MCPs are actually closer to the complete dataset than to the MCPs of the subsamples, both in terms of EOO and geographically. This occurs when using a probability threshold based on maximum geographical similarity between the SDM-derived MCP and the subsample MCP; other threshold methods performed less well. For the species with less well-known distributions, the SDM-derived EOOs correlate strongly with, but tend to be larger than, EOOs estimated by point data. This implies that a SDM-derived EOO may be more representative of the full EOO than that drawn around known localities. Our findings reveal situations in which SDMs provide useful information that complements the IUCN Red Listing process. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study aimed to evaluate the effects of twenty species of tropical macroalgae on in vitro fermentation parameters, total gas production (TGP) and methane (CH4) production when incubated in rumen fluid from cattle fed a low quality roughage diet. Primary biochemical parameters of macroalgae were characterized and included proximate, elemental, and fatty acid (FAME) analysis. Macroalgae and the control, decorticated cottonseed meal (DCS), were incubated in vitro for 72 h, where gas production was continuously monitored. Post-fermentation parameters, including CH4 production, pH, ammonia, apparent organic matter degradability (OMd), and volatile fatty acid (VFA) concentrations were measured. All species of macroalgae had lower TGP and CH4 production than DCS. Dictyota and Asparagopsis had the strongest effects, inhibiting TGP by 53.2% and 61.8%, and CH4 production by 92.2% and 98.9% after 72 h, respectively. Both species also resulted in the lowest total VFA concentration, and the highest molar concentration of propionate among all species analysed, indicating that anaerobic fermentation was affected. Overall, there were no strong relationships between TGP or CH4 production and the >70 biochemical parameters analysed. However, zinc concentrations >0.10 g.kg(-1) may potentially interact with other biochemical components to influence TGP and CH4 production. The lack of relationship between the primary biochemistry of species and gas parameters suggests that significant decreases in TGP and CH4 production are associated with secondary metabolites produced by effective macroalgae. The most effective species, Asparagopsis, offers the most promising alternative for mitigation of enteric CH4 emissions.

AB Species distribution models have been used extensively in many fields, including climate change biology, landscape ecology and conservation biology. In the past 3 decades, a number of new models have been proposed, yet researchers still find it difficult to select appropriate models for data and objectives. In this review, we aim to provide insight into the prevailing species distribution models for newcomers in the field of modelling. We compared 11 popular models, including regression models (the generalized linear model, the generalized additive model, the multivariate adaptive regression splines model and hierarchical modelling), classification models (mixture discriminant analysis, the generalized boosting model, and classification and regression tree analysis) and complex models (artificial neural network, random forest, genetic algorithm for rule set production and maximum entropy approaches). Our objectives are: (i) to compare the strengths and weaknesses of the models, their characteristics and identify suitable situations for their use (in terms of data type and species-environment relationships) and (ii) to provide guidelines for model application, including 3 steps: model selection, model formulation and parameter estimation.

AB Improving global yields of important agricultural crops is a complex challenge. Enhancing yield and resource use by engineering improvements to photosynthetic carbon assimilation is one potential solution. During the last 40 million years C-4 photosynthesis has evolved multiple times, enabling plants to evade the catalytic inadequacies of the CO2-fixing enzyme, ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (rubisco). Compared with their C-3 ancestors, C-4 plants combine a faster rubisco with a biochemical CO2-concentrating mechanism, enabling more efficient use of water and nitrogen and enhanced yield. Here we show the versatility of plastome manipulation in tobacco for identifying sequences in C-4-rubisco that can be transplanted into C-3-rubisco to improve carboxylation rate (V-C). Using transplastomic tobacco lines expressing native and mutated rubisco large subunits (L-subunits) from Flaveria pringlei (C-3), Flaveria floridana (C-3-C-4), and Flaveria bidentis (C-4), we reveal that Met-309-Ile substitutions in the L-subunit act as a catalytic switch between C-4 ((309)Ile; faster V-C, lower CO2 affinity) and C-3 ((309)Met; slower V-C, higher CO2 affinity) catalysis. Application of this transplastomic system permits further identification of other structural solutions selected by nature that can increase rubisco V-C in C-3 crops. Coengineering a catalytically faster C-3 rubisco and a CO2-concentrating mechanism within C-3 crop species could enhance their efficiency in resource use and yield.

AB Aim
   We use data from 13 mountain regions and surrounding lowland areas to identify (1) the origins, traits and cultural uses of alien plant species that establish in mountains, (2) the alien species that are most likely to be a threat and (3) how managers might use this information to prevent further invasions.
   Location
   Australia, Canada, Chile, India, New Zealand, South Africa, Spain, Switzerland, USA.
   Methods
   Lists of alien species were compiled for mountains and their surrounding or nearby lowlands. Principal co-ordinates analysis was performed on a matrix of similarities created using presence/absence data for alien species. The significance of differences between means for (1) similarity metrics of lowland and mountain groups and (2) species traits of lowland and mountain alien floras was determined using t-tests. In seven of the 13 mountain regions, lists of alien species undergoing management were compiled. The significance of differences between proportions of traits for species requiring and not requiring management input was determined with chi-square tests.
   Results
   We found that the proximal lowland alien flora is the main determinant of a mountain region's alien species composition. The highest similarities between mountain floras were in the Americas/Pacific Region. The majority of alien species commonly found in mountains have agricultural origins and are of little concern to land managers. Woody species and those used for ornamental purposes will often pose the greatest threat.
   Main conclusions
   Given the documented potential threat of alien species invading mountains, we advise natural resource managers to take preventive measures against the risk of alien plant invasion in mountains. A strategy for prevention should extend to the surrounding lowland areas and in particular regulate the introduction of species that are already of management concern in other mountains as well as climatically pre-adapted alien mountain plants. These may well become more problematic than the majority of alien plants currently in mountains.

AB 1. Farmland biodiversity continues to decline mainly because of agricultural intensification and land abandonment. Agri-environment schemes can be designed to halt this loss by favouring extensification of agricultural practices and through sympathetic management of field boundaries and fallow land. In Europe, High Nature Value (HNV) farmland is defined as low-intensity farmland supporting or associated with a high rate of biodiversity, in terms of species richness or habitat diversity and therefore plays a crucial role in the maintenance of European biodiversity. However, no large-scale analysis has explored the role of these areas in achieving conservation goals.
   2. We analysed information from widely used indicators in order to describe the impact of low-intensity agriculture on farmland biodiversity in France. We used the HNV farmland indicator, based on agricultural statistics such as the Farm Structure Survey and the grassland survey, and common bird indicators, i.e. the Farmland Bird Indicator (FBI), the Community Specialization Index (CSI) and species richness indexes, based on the French Breeding Bird Survey.
   3. Temporal trends in the farmland bird indicator showed that populations of farmland birds were more likely to increase inside HNV areas compared to non-HNV areas. Although species richness is not higher within HNV farmland, bird communities are composed by more specialist species than in non-HNV areas. In addition, these specialist bird species are significantly more abundant in HNV areas.
   4. Synthesis and applications. Further farmland biodiversity decline is potentially reversible through an appropriate management of HNV areas. Existing and future agri-environment schemes should focus on preserving and extending HNV farmland, by favouring the maintenance of low-intensity agriculture and landscape complexity. Priority should be given to preserving diversity at the community level, with the help of adequate indicators, such as the ones presented here. The role of HNV farmland or similar concepts in combining agriculture and biodiversity goals should be further analysed and further used as large-scale conservation tools.

AB A molecular phylogeny, based on sequence data from three mitochondrial (12S rRNA, 16S rRNA and COI) genes, is presented for the Patel loga stropod a, including representatives of almost all genera belonging to the Acmaeidae, Lepetidae, Lottiidae, Nacellidae and Patellidae. For comparison, a smaller dataset of sequences from two nuclear (18S rRNA and 28S rRNA) genes is presented. The mitochondrial gene phylogeny shows considerable disagreement with earlier hypotheses derived from morphological data. The Patellidae, Nacellidae and Lepetidae are monophyletic, but the Acmaeidae and Lottiidae are polyphyletic. The family Acmaeidae is divided into two clades corresponding to the subfamilies Acmaeinae and Pectinodontinae, but these two do not form a clade. The Acmaeinae are synonymized with the Lottiidae, and the Pectinodontinae are elevated to familial rank. Our results suggest that the Palelloida profunda group (fo)rmerly assigned to the Lottiidae) is the most basal group within the Patellogastropoda. We assign this group to a new genus, Eoacmaea, in the new family Eoacmaeidae. We Used a Bayesian Markov-Chain Monte Carlo approach together with the fossil record to estimate divergence times from the combined DNA sequence data. The lineage of extant Patellogastropoda is estimated to have originated as long ago as Late Jurassic. The phylogeny also Suggests that the principal clades and antitropical distribution pattern of the Patellogastropoda formed during the Mesozoic to early Cenozoic, in association with the disruption of Pan,gea and following the establishment and decline of the circumglobal equatorial current.

AB 1. Floods and low flows are hydrological events that influence river ecosystems, but few studies have compared their relative importance in structuring invertebrate communities. Invertebrates were sampled in riffles and runs at eight sites along 40 km of a New Zealand gravel-bed river every 1-3 months over 2.5 years, during which time a number of large flood and low flow events occurred. Flows were high in winter and spring, and low in summer and autumn. Four flow-related variables were calculated from hydrological data: flow on the day of sampling Q(sample)), maximum and minimum flow between successive samples (Q(max) and Q(min), respectively), and the number of days since the last bed-moving flood (N-days).
   2. The invertebrate community was summarised by relative densities of the 19 most abundant taxa and four biotic metrics [total abundance, taxon richness, the number of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera taxa (i.e. EPT richness), and per cent EPT]. Invertebrate density fluctuated greatly, and was high in summer and autumn, and low during winter and spring. Stepwise multiple regression (SMR) analysis was used to investigate relationships between the invertebrate community and season, flow, habitat and water temperature.
   3. Seasonal variables were included in almost 50% of the SMR models, while flow-related variables were included in > 75% of models. Densities of many taxa were negatively correlated to Q(min) and Q(max), and positively correlated to N-days, suggesting that while high flows reduced invertebrate densities, densities recovered with increasing time following a flood. Although season and flow were confounded in this study, many of the taxa analysed display little seasonal variation in abundance, suggesting that flow-related variables were more important in structuring communities than seasonal changes in density associated with life-cycles.
   4. Five discrete flood and low flow events were identified and changes to invertebrate communities before and after these events examined. Invertebrate densities decreased more commonly after floods than after low flows, and there was a significant positive relationship between the number of taxa showing reductions in density and flood magnitude. Densities of most invertebrates either remained unchanged, or increased after low flow events, except for four taxa whose densities declined after a very long period (up to 9 months) of low flow. This decline was attributed to autogenic sloughing of thick periphyton communities and subsequent loss of habitat for these taxa.
   5. Invertebrate communities changed more after floods and the degree of change was proportional to flood magnitude. Community similarity increased with increasing time since the last disturbance, suggesting that the longer stable flows lasted, the less the community changed. These results suggest that invertebrate communities in the Waipara River were controlled by both floods and low flows, but that the relative effects of floods were greater than even extended periods of extreme low flow.
   6. Hydraulic conditions in riffles and runs were measured throughout the study. Riffles had consistently faster velocities, but were shallower and narrower than runs at all measured flows. Invertebrate density in riffles was expressed as a percentage of total density and regressed against the flow-related variables to see whether invertebrate locations changed according to flow. Significant negative relationships were observed between the per cent density of common taxa in riffles and Q(sample), Q(max) and Q(min). This result suggests either that these animals actively drifted into areas of faster velocity during low flows, or that their densities within riffles increased as the width of these habitats declined.

AB Review articles are important sources of information and often the only source of evidence used by decision makers in conservation and environmental management to assess effectiveness and impact of interventions and other actions. Recent developments in the field of medicine and public health have established 'systematic review' guidelines to minimise bias and explicitly document methodology, allowing replication and updating in light of further advances. The aim of this article was to assess the methodological and reporting rigour of reviews from the disciplines of conservation, ecology and environmental management (referred to as "ecological reviews"). This was achieved by comparing them to medical systematic reviews, using 27 detailed criteria well established in medicine. When compared with medical systematic reviews, ecological reviews were more likely to be prone to bias, lacking details in the methods used to search for studies, and were less likely to assess the relevance of studies, quality of the original experiments and to quantitatively synthesise the evidence. overall, ecological reviews show lower quality and greater variation in reporting style and review methods. To address this, reviewers could use a systematic review approach and journals could provide more explicit guidelines for the preparation and production of review articles. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The responses of photosynthetic gas exchange, chlorophyll fluorescence, activities of antioxidant enzymes and lipid membrane peroxidation of two contrasting Picea asperata Mast. populations to 30% of full sunlight (shade) and full sunlight (sun) were investigated under well-watered and drought conditions. Two contrasting populations were from the wet and dry climate regions in China, respectively. For both populations tested, drought resulted in lower needle relative water content (RWC), CO2 assimilation rate (A), stomatal conductance (gs) and effective PSII quantum yield (Y), and higher non-photochemical quenching (qN), superoxide dismutase (SOD), ascorbate peroxidase (APX) activities as well as malondialdehyde (MDA) levels and electrolyte leakage in sun plants, whereas these changes were not significant in shade plants. For the wet climate population, shade plants showed higher chlorophyll contents (Chla, Chlb and Chla + b) than sun plants under both well-watered and drought conditions. Our study results implied that shade, applied together with drought, ameliorated the detrimental effects of drought. On the other hand, compared with the wet climate population, the dry climate population was more tolerant to drought in the sun treatment, as indicated by less decreases in A and mass-based leaf nitrogen content (N-mass), more responsive stomata, greater capacity for non-radiative dissipation of excitation energy as heat (analysed by qN), and higher level of antioxidant enzyme activities as well as lower MDA content and electrolyte leakage. These results demonstrated that the different physiological strategies were employed by the P. asperata populations from contrasting climate regions when the plants were exposed to drought and shade.

AB Our analysis of the ND2 sequences revealed six clades within winter wrens (Troglodytes troglodytes). These clades corresponded to six geographical regions: western Nearctic, eastern Nearctic, eastern Asia, Nepal, Caucasus and Europe, and differed by 3-8.8% of sequence divergence. Differences among regions explained 96% of the sequence variation in winter wren. Differences among individuals within localities explained 3% of the sequence variation, and differences among localities within regions explained 1%. Grouping sequences into subspecies instead of localities did not change these proportions. Proliferation of the six clades coincided with Early and Middle Pleistocene glaciations. The distribution of winter wren clades can be explained by a series of five consecutive vicariant events. Western Nearctic wrens diverged from the Holarctic ancestor 1.6 Myr before the present time (MYBP). Eastern Nearctic and Palaearctic wrens diverged 1 MYBP. Eastern and western Palaearctic birds diverged 0.83 MYBP. Nepalese and east Asian wrens diverged 0.67 MYBP, and Caucasian birds diverged from European wrens 0.54 MyBP. The winter wren has a much greater degree of inter- and intracontinental differentiation than the three other Holarctic birds studied to date-dunlin (Calidris alpina), common raven (Corvus corax) and three-toed woodpecker (Picoides trydactylus)-and represents an example of cryptic speciation that has been overlooked.

ID CONSEQUENCES; BIODIVERSITY; RANGES
AB National parks and bioreserves are key conservation tools used to protect species and their habitats within the confines of fixed political boundaries. This inflexibility may be their "Achilles' heel" as conservation tools in the face of emerging global-scale environmental problems such as climate change. Global climate change, brought about by rising levels of greenhouse gases, threatens to alter the geographic distribution of many habitats and their component species. With these changes comes great uncertainty about the future ability of parks and protected areas to meet their conservation mandates. We report here on an analysis aimed at assessing the extent of mammalian species turnover that may be experienced in eight selected U.S. national parks if climate change causes mammalian species within the continental U.S. to relocate to new geographic locations. Due to species losses of up to 20% and drastic influxes of new species, national parks are not likely to meet their mandate of protecting current biodiversity within park boundaries. This approach represents a conservative prognosis. As species assemblages change, new interactions between species may lead to less predictable indirect effects of climate change, increasing the toll beyond that found in this study.

AB Two related bet-hedging hypotheses have been proposed to explain the evolution of multiple mating by females. The first examines fitness of females within a single type of environment, and predicts that multiple mating can increase fitness by reducing the probability that all of a female's eggs are fertilized by a poor-quality male. The second examines fitness across environments and predicts that females who mate multiple times reduce the probability that all of their eggs are fertilized by a male that is unsuited to the current environment. We tested whether multiple mating actually provides the fitness benefits predicted by bet-hedging models by comparing the geometric mean fitness across generations of half-sib versus full-sib families of the milkweed bug, Lygaeus kalmii, reared on three different host plants. The variance in mean fitness (egg-to-adult survivorship) was always lower for offspring in half-sib families than for offspring of full-sib families. This translated into an average increase in geometric mean fitness of 4.1% within environments and 1.3% among environments for offspring of multiple-mated versus once-mated parents. These fitness increases are sufficient to produce rapid replacement of a once-mating genotype by a multiple-mating genotype. We conclude that multiple mating by parents reduces variation in offspring fitness and increases geometric mean fitness. We suggest that bet-hedging hypotheses are viable explanations for at least some of the variation in mating frequency observed in insects.

AB The functional composition of herbivorous insect assemblages was correlated with aspects of new and mature leaf surface features, anatomy and morphology across 18 co-occurring plant species. Multivariate analyses of insects and leaf traits revealed that the functional composition of the herbivore assemblage was more strongly correlated with leaf structural traits than with leaf constituents. Leaf traits were more strongly correlated with the functional composition of the herbivore assemblage than with its taxonomic composition. Densities of sessile phloem feeders, rostrum chewers, and all herbivores were significantly negatively correlated with specific leaf weight, lamina and cuticle thickness, vascular tissue depth and stomate length, and were significantly positively correlated with stomate density External chewer densities were significantly negatively correlated with percent lignified vein area, and significantly positively correlated with leaf surface area and the distance between lignified tissues. Spine-like leaves were associated with significantly lower densities of sessile phloem feeders, external chewers and all herbivores compared to kite leaves (kite leaves are comprised of unfortified leaf tissue supported by a framework of vascular tissue). The presence of a thickened leaf hypodermis was associated with significantly lower densities of external chewers and rostrum chewers, while midrib protection was associated with significantly lower densities of external chewers. Leaf structural traits may not be the proximal factors influencing herbivorous insects, as leaf structural traits are correlated with many other plant traits such as photosynthetic rate, relative growth rate and leaf life-span. Nonetheless, these results indicate that certain leaf structural traits may potentially be used to predict the functional structure of herbivorous insect assemblages.

AB Large-scale bleaching events are major disturbances to coral health and community structure, but may also affect other coral reef taxa, such as fishes. In 1997-1998, wide-spread coral bleaching and mortality occurred across the Great Barrier Reef, caused by increases in sea surface temperatures resulting from El Nino Southern Oscillation. As part of this event, in February-March 1998, there was extensive bleaching within One Tree Island lagoon (southern Great Barrier Reef), such that almost 12 mo later there was a significant reduction of live coral cover at some sites. We monitored the distribution of adults and recruitment of damselfishes (Pomacentridae) to sites within One Tree Island in 1993-1995 and in 1999. Fish species that normally associate with live corals showed relatively lower recruitment at bleached sites compared to the same sites pre-bleaching or to recovered sites and, as a result, species diversity and assemblage structure of recruits changed. Compared to 1993/1995 densities, adult Pomacentrus wardi, P. moluccensis and Chrysiptera rollandi densities dropped at bleached sites, but not at unbleached sites. While P. moluccensis directly associate with live corals, the other 2 species do not. This study has demonstrated that indirect effects of bleaching can include changes in assemblage structure of reef fish adults and recruits.

AB 1. We evaluated the potential for three species of deciduous-forest herbs to exploit seasonal periods of direct irradiance. In particular, we investigated the importance of photosynthetic acclimation as a mechanism for shade-tolerant herbs to utilize direct light reaching the forest floor before canopy expansion in the spring and after canopy leaf drop in the autumn.
   2. We measured the photosynthetic and growth characteristics of three co-occurring herbs of a northern hardwood forest: the spring ephemeral Allium tricoccum Ait., the summer-green Viola pubescens Ait.. and the semi-evergreen Tiarella cordifolia L.
   3. Leaf CO2 exchange, leaf mass per area, and leaf biochemistry differed among species and seasonally within species to match the changing light environment below the forest canopy. From spring to summer, as irradiance dropped with the expansion of the overstorey canopy. Viola leaves exhibited reduction of both photosynthetic capacity and light compensation point. Weaker acclimation of less magnitude occurred in Tiarella leaves over the spring-summer light transition, this was followed by further acclimation to the stronger autumn irradiance.
   4. Viola's greater range of photosynthetic acclimation was associated with shifts in allocation between Rubisco and chlorophyll, as well as changes in total leaf nitrogen (N) concentration and leaf mass per area (LMA). In contrast, Tiarella's narrow range of acclimation was associated solely with changes in allocation to Rubisco versus chlorophyll, with no changes in total leaf N or LMA.
   5. Seasonal changes in leaf chemistry and structure in Viola suggest a stepwise ontogeny whereby individual leaves are able to function as 'sun leaves' for 3-5 weeks in the spring. and then as 'shade leaves' for up to 3 months in the summer.
   6. Whole-plant biomass accumulation showed that all three species accumulated most of their annual biomass increment during periods of direct irradiance. These results demonstrate the importance of brief seasonal periods of strong irradiance to the growth of deciduous forest herbs, even shade-tolerant, summer and evergreen species.

AB Differences in individual Fitness among habitats may explain patterns of habitat selection and why individuals compete for habitats. Transplant experiments at two widely separated locations on the Great Barrier Reef were used to examine growth and survival of two competing species of coral-dwelling fish (Gobiodon histrio and G. brochus) that inhabit two species of coral (Acropora nasuta and A. loripes). At Lizard Island on the northern Great Barrier Reef, growth of G. histrio was 3 times higher and survival was 5 times higher on A. nasuta than on A. loripes. These fitness-related advantages may explain why G. histrio mostly inhabits and competes strongly for A. nasuta in the field. Growth of G. brochus was 2.5 times higher on A. nasuta than on A. loripes and survival was approximately equal on each species of coral. However, G. brochus mostly inhabits A. loripes in the field and is excluded from A. nasuta as a result of competition with G. histrio. Reduced growth in A. loripes demonstrates a cost of competition with G. histrio. These results also demonstrate a trade-off between competitive ability and the costs of using alternative habitats for G. histrio and G. brochus. Patterns of growth and survival on A. nasuta and A. loripes at One Tree Island on the southern Great Barrier Reef were generally similar to those at Lizard Island. However, growth rates for both species of fish on A. loripes and survival of G. histrio on A. loripes were lower at One Tree Island. Growth was closely correlated with the interbranch space of the coral species inhabited at each location Therefore, habitat structure appears to be the mechanism underlying habitat-related differences in growth.

AB Adults of the Syrphinae subfamily display no strong flower preferences but exploit pollen and nectar produced by native plants having large inflorescences and flat corollae (e.g. Apiaceae, Asteraceae, Ranunculaceae and Rosaceae). Seven foraging guilds are defined according to the dietary patterns of hoverflies, reflecting mainly a sequential exploitation of flowers at different times of the year and in different habitats.
   The majority of species live in forests where they form highly diversified communities. Few Syrphinae colonize successfully open and anthropogenic habitats, such as field margins and fallow areas. Episyrphus balteatus. Melanostoma mellinum, Eupeodes corollae. Sphaerophoria scripta and Plutycheirus spp. are dominant in the communities of Syrphinae from open habitats, all over western Europe. These species are highly polyphagous and characterized by elongated mouthparts as well as a long and slender body. They have access to pollen and nectar in flowers with small and tubular corollae. It is suggested that their polyphagy is an important asset for colonizing open and ephemeral habitats.

AB Understanding the functional linkages between the pelagic and demersal stages of marine organisms is a central goal in ecology. To better understand events that occurred during the larval period as well as their initial influence on juvenile traits, we examined individual level variation in early Life-history traits (larval and early juvenile otolith growth rates, size-at-age, and larval duration) of 3 seasonal cohorts of the common coral reef fish Thalassoma bifasciatum (Bloch) (Labridae). Juveniles were collected at regular intervals (every second day) for 2 wk following their first appearance on the nearshore reefs of Barbados, West Indies. Otolith analysis indicated that each cohort exhibited a broad range of larval traits. Individuals with shorter larval durations had faster otolith growth and settled at relatively smaller sizes (based on otolith length and standard length) than larvae with longer larval durations, which exhibited slower otolith growth rates. Despite the range in larval durations for T. bifasciatum, otolith growth records revealed no evidence for delay of metamorphosis. Instead, the range in larval durations is likely to be the result of-a variable pelagic environment influencing growth rates. Because metamorphosis in this species is an energetically costly non-feeding (3 to 5 d) period, we propose that successful metamorphosis requires a minimum energy reserve. Slower growers may need to remain in the plankton longer (consequently attaining larger sizes) to obtain this minimum condition. Variability in early life-history traits also occurred among the seasonal cohorts. Despite differences in patterns of larval otolith growth, mean larval duration was similar for the 2 fall cohorts (57 and 55 d), but much shorter for the spring cohort (42 d). Such inter-cohort variability in early life-history traits suggests a variable pelagic environment. In contrast to the larval period, juvenile growth rates were much less variable within and among cohorts, reflecting a more constant physical and biological environment on the reef.

AB Taxonomic rank is an important criterion in assessing the conservation priority of an endangered organism: the sole member of a distinct family will generally receive a higher priority than a semi-isolated population in a polytypic species. When cryptic evolutionary partitions are discovered in endangered species, these findings are heralded as a positive step in the conservation process. The opposite action, demoting the taxonomic rank of an endangered organism, can be resisted by the conservation community because it is perceived as detrimental to preservation efforts. We explore the arguments for and against the species status of the endangered black turtle (Chelonia agassizii) and contribute an additional data set based on DNA sequences of single-copy nuclear loci. These data are concordant with previous mtDNA surveys in indicating no evolutionary distinction between C. agassizii and adjacent green turtle (C. mydas) populations. Although the black turtle is morphologically identifiable at a low level, much of its distinction is based on size and color differences that are highly variable throughout the range of C. mydas. Thus the black turtle would be more accurately classified at the subspecific or population level. There is no strong scientific case available to defend the species status of C. agassizii, and yet that designation has persisted for over a century. We suggest that the maintenance of this name is based on geographical and political considerations, and we propose a pragmatic category for this type of taxonomy: the geopolitical species. Furthermore, we argue against the practice of preserving species status for conservation purposes. There are several good reasons to preserve the black turtle, including morphological diversity and the possibility that it is an incipient evolutionary lineage with novel adaptations; taxonomic rank, however, is not one of them.

AB Using 139 flux studies, we addressed the variability of net ecosystem surface assimilation (A(smax)), net ecosystem surface respiration (R-smax), as well as net surface evapotranspiration (E-smax) among and within vegetation types. While forests and C-3 crops, particularly in the northern hemisphere, have been preferentially investigated, information on tropical forests, C-4 grasslands or wetlands is rather limited. Almost no data are available for disturbed sites. Despite large variations within a vegetation type, enclosure studies tended to give highest A(smax) rates compared to micrometeorological techniques. Excluding enclosure studies, we tested the effect of stand age and leaf area index (LAI) on net ecosystem gas exchange. For grasslands, A(smax) increased by 7 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) per unit LAI, for C-4 crops by 11 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) and for coniferous forests by 0.9 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) per unit LAI. In contrast, A(smax) of broad-leaved forests and C-3 crops as well as R-smax stayed m(-2) s(-1) constant over a wide range of LAI. A(smax) and R-smax of forests were lowest in young stands (< 20 years old) and highest in stands of age 38-80 years. A(smax) of old forests (> 160 years) was within the same range as those of 30- to 80-year-old forests, and always higher than those of regenerating stands. R-smax seemed to decrease with age. A(smax) increased linearly with ecosystem surface conductance for all vegetation types (r(2) = 0.65). A(smax) of forests and grasslands was closely related to E-smax (r(2) = 0.87), with a slope of 0.082 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1)/mmol H2O m(-2) s(-1). The results clearly illustrated where gaps in our knowledge exist and how ecosystem properties affect the capacity of net ecosystem gas exchange.

AB 1. The spatial distribution of two wild ungulates, impala and kudu, and of domestic cattle, was monitored across seasons in a 9400 ha ranch of the 'highveld' of Zimbabwe. Habitat use, preference, selectivity and overlap were estimated. Predation was negligible and the study concentrated on interspecific competition.
   2. Cattle were contained in paddocks, and were moved regularly, while wild ungulates moved freely. Wild ungulate habitat use, preference and selectivity between paddocks with and without cattle were compared, as was the variation in broad diet, group size and densities.
   3. All herbivores were selective, with a marked preference for the nutrient-rich Acacia/Dichrostachys vegetation type. Terminalia communities were almost completely avoided. Selectivity increased as the dry season progressed. Habitat overlap was always high.
   4. Interspecific competition occurred between cattle and impala, especially during the wet season and the hot dry season. Impala showed a switch in habitat preference and an increase in selectivity and started to concentrate on 'refuge habitat'. Some also switched in their diet composition. During the hot dry season, when resources were at their lowest, most impala stopped using paddocks with cattle.
   5. Kudu seemed relatively unaffected by the presence of cattle: the variations observed in kudu spatial behaviour may have been caused by competition with impala.

AB Pronounced spatial variation in recruitment occurs in many marine invertebrate and fish populations and is thought to be critical to the demography of these species. In this study I examined the importance of habitat structure and the presence of conspecific residents to spatial variation in larval settlement and recruitment in a temperate fish Tautogolabrus adspersus. I define settlement as the movement of individuals from the water column to the benthic habitat, while I refer to recruitment as numbers of individuals surviving some arbitrary period of time after settlement. Experiments in which standard habitats were stocked with conspecifics showed that resident conspecifics were not an important factor contributing to small-scale variability in recruitment. Further correlative analyses demonstrated that large-scale variation in recruitment could not be explained by variability in older age classes. By contrast, manipulations of macroalgal structure within a kelp bed demonstrated that recruitment was significantly higher in habitats with a dense understory of foliose and filamentous algae than in habitats with only crustose algae. Understory algae varied in their pattern of dispersion among sites, and the dispersion of fish matched that of the plants. In order to determine the effects of differences in patterns of algal dispersion on the demography of associated T. adspersus populations. I used experimental habitat units to manipulate patterns of dispersion. Settlement was significantly greater to randomly placed versus clumped habitats, however, no differences in recruitment between random and clumped habitats were detected. Because recruitment is a function of the numbers of settlers minus the subsequent loss of settlers, rates of mortality or migration must have been higher in the randomly placed habitats. These results are counter to the current paradigm for reef fishes which suggests that larval settlement is the crucial demographic process producing variability in population abundance. In this experiment patterns of settlement were modified by varying the patch structure of the habitat.

AB Fungi play many essential roles in ecosystems. They facilitate plant access to nutrients and water, serve as decay agents that cycle carbon and nutrients through the soil, water and atmosphere, and are major regulators of macro-organismal populations. Although technological advances are improving the detection and identification of fungi, there still exist key gaps in our ecological knowledge of this kingdom, especially related to function. Trait-based approaches have been instrumental in strengthening our understanding of plant functional ecology and, as such, provide excellent models for deepening our understanding of fungal functional ecology in ways that complement insights gained from traditional and -omics-based techniques. In this review, we synthesize current knowledge of fungal functional ecology, taxonomy and systematics and introduce a novel database of fungal functional traits (Fun(Fun)). Fun(Fun) is built to interface with other databases to explore and predict how fungal functional diversity varies by taxonomy, guild, and other evolutionary or ecological grouping variables. To highlight how a quantitative trait-based approach can provide new insights, we describe multiple targeted examples and end by suggesting next steps in the rapidly growing field of fungal functional ecology.

AB The root economics spectrum (RES), a common hypothesis postulating a tradeoff between resource acquisition and conservation traits, is being challenged by conflicting relationships between root diameter, tissue density (RTD) and root nitrogen concentration (RN). Here, we analyze a global trait dataset of absorptive roots for over 800 plant species. For woody species (but not for non-woody species), we find nonlinear relationships between root diameter and RTD and RN, which stem from the allometric relationship between stele and cortical tissues. These nonlinear relationships explain how sampling bias from different ends of the nonlinear curves can result in conflicting trait relationships. Further, the shape of the relationships varies depending on evolutionary context and mycorrhizal affiliation. Importantly, the observed nonlinear trait relationships do not support the RES predictions. Allometry-based nonlinearity of root trait relationships improves our understanding of the ecology, physiology and evolution of absorptive roots.

AB Foundational to trait-based community ecology is the expectation that functional traits determine demographic outcomes. However, trait demographic rate relationships are frequently weak, particularly in tree communities. The foundation of trait-based tree community ecology may, therefore, appear to be unstable. Here we argue that there are three core reasons why trait demographic relationships are generally weak in tree communities. Specifically, important contextual information is frequently ignored, there is too much focus on species relative to individuals, and there are dimensions of tree function that are critical for determining tree demographic rates that are not captured by easily measured functional traits. Rather than being evidence that trait-based community ecology is fundamentally flawed, these issues elucidate a pathway towards a more robust research program.

AB Genetic diversity confers adaptive capacity to populations under changing conditions but its role in mediating impacts of climate change remains unresolved for most ecosystems. This lack of knowledge is particularly acute for foundation species, where impacts may cascade throughout entire ecosystems. We combined population genetics with eco-physiological and ecological field experiments to explore relationships among latitudinal patterns in genetic diversity, physiology and resilience of a kelp ecosystem to climate stress. A subsequent 'natural experiment' illustrated the possible influence of latitudinal patterns of genetic diversity on ecosystem vulnerability to an extreme climatic perturbation (marine heatwave). There were strong relationships between physiological versatility, ecological resilience and genetic diversity of kelp forests across latitudes, and genetic diversity consistently outperformed other explanatory variables in contributing to the response of kelp forests to the marine heatwave. Population performance and vulnerability to a severe climatic event were thus strongly related to latitudinal patterns in genetic diversity, with the heatwave extirpating forests with low genetic diversity. Where foundation species control ecological structure and function, impacts of climatic stress can cascade through the ecosystem and, consequently, genetic diversity could contribute to ecosystem vulnerability to climate change.

AB Ensembles used for probabilistic weather forecasting tend to be biased and underdispersive. This paper proposes a statistical method for postprocessing ensembles based on quantile regression forests (QRF), a generalization of random forests for quantile regression. This method does not fit a parametric probability density function (PDF) like in ensemble model output statistics (EMOS) but provides an estimation of desired quantiles. This is a nonparametric approach that eliminates any assumption on the variable subject to calibration. This method can estimate quantiles using not only members of the ensemble but any predictor available including statistics on other variables.The method is applied to the Meteo-France 35-member ensemble forecast (PEARP) for surface temperature and wind speed for available lead times from 3 up to 54 h and compared to EMOS. All postprocessed ensembles are much better calibrated than the PEARP raw ensemble and experiments on real data also show that QRF performs better than EMOS, and can bring a real gain for human forecasters compared to EMOS. QRF provides sharp and reliable probabilistic forecasts. At last, classical scoring rules to verify predictive forecasts are completed by the introduction of entropy as a general measure of reliability.

AB Understanding the effects of scale is essential to the understanding of natural ecosystems, particularly in marine environments where sampling is more limited and sporadic than in terrestrial environments. Despite its recognized importance, scale is rarely considered in benthic habitat mapping studies. Lack of explicit statement of scale in the literature is an impediment to better characterization of seafloor pattern and process. This review paper highlights the importance of incorporating ecological scaling and geographical theories in benthic habitat mapping. It reviews notions of ecological scale and benthic habitat mapping, in addition to the way spatial scale influences patterns and processes in benthic habitats. We address how scale is represented in geographic data, how it influences their analysis, and consequently how it influences our understanding of seafloor ecosystems. We conclude that quantification of ecological processes at multiple scales using spatial statistics is needed to gain a better characterization of species-habitat relationships. We offer recommendations on more effective practices in benthic habitat mapping, including sampling that covers multiple spatial scales and that includes as many environmental variables as possible, adopting continuum-based habitat characterization approaches, using statistical analyses that consider the spatial nature of data, and explicit statement of the scale at which the research was conducted. We recommend a set of improved standards for defining benthic habitat. With these standards benthic habitats can be defined as 'areas of seabed that are (geo)statistically significantly different from their surroundings in terms of physical, chemical and biological characteristics, when observed at particular spatial and temporal scales'.

AB Artificial light at night has a wide range of biological effects on both plants and animals. Here, we review mechanisms by which artificial light at night may restructure ecological communities by modifying the interactions between species. Such mechanisms may be top-down (predator, parasite or grazer controlled), bottom-up (resource-controlled) or involve non-trophic processes, such as pollination, seed dispersal or competition. We present results from an experiment investigating both top-down and bottom-up effects of artificial light at night on the population density of pea aphids Acyrthosiphon pisum in a diverse artificial grassland community in the presence and absence of predators and under low-level light of different spectral composition. We found no evidence for top-down control of A. pisum in this system, but did find evidence for bottom-up effects mediated through the impact of light on flower head density in a leguminous food plant. These results suggest that physiological effects of light on a plant species within a diverse plant community can have detectable demographic effects on a specialist herbivore.

AB Land conversion affects the delivery of ecosystem goods and services. In this study, we used a 50 years time series of land cover maps to assess the potential impacts of forest cover changes on ecosystem services. A multi-source data integration strategy was followed to reduce inconsistencies in land cover change detection that result from the comparison of historical aerial photographs and satellite images. Our forest cover change analysis highlighted a shift from net deforestation to net reforestation in the early 1990s, consistent with the forest transition theory. When taking the nature of forest cover changes into account, our data show that the areal increase of the forested area was not associated with an improvement in ecological conditions. The overall capacity of the landscape to deliver ecosystem services dropped steadily by 16% over the 50 years' study period. Conversion of native forests to agricultural land was associated with the strongest decline in ecosystem services. Conversion of natural grasslands into pine plantations mostly led to negative and probably irreversible impacts on the delivery of ecosystem services. Conversion of degraded agricultural lands into pine plantations led to an improvement in ecological conditions. An effective spatial targeting of forestation programs has the potential to maximize the environmental benefits that forest plantations may offer while minimizing their environmental harm.

AB Root traits vary enormously among plant species but we have little understanding of how this variation affects their functioning. Of central interest is how root traits are related to plant resource acquisition strategies from soil. We examined root traits of 33 woody species from northeastern US forests that form two of the most common types of mutualisms with fungi, arbuscular mycorrhizas (AM) and ectomycorrhizas (EM). We examined root trait distribution with respect to plant phylogeny, quantifying the phylogenetic signal (K statistic) in fine root morphology and architecture, and used phylogenetically independent contrasts (PICs) to test whether taxa forming different mycorrhizal associations had different root traits. We found a pattern of species forming roots with thinner diameters as species diversified across time. Given moderate phylogenetic signals (K = 0.44-0.68), we used PICs to examine traits variation among taxa forming AM or EM, revealing that hosts of AM were associated with lower branching intensity (r(PIC) = -0.77) and thicker root diameter (rPIC = -0.41). Because EM evolved relatively more recently and intermittently across plant phylogenies, significant differences in root traits and colonization between plants forming AM and EM imply linkages between the evolution of these biotic interactions and root traits and suggest a history of selection pressures, with trade-offs for supporting different types of associations. Finally, across plant hosts of both EM and AM, species with thinner root diameters and longer specific root length (SRL) had less colonization (rPIC = 0.85, -0.87), suggesting constraints on colonization linked to the evolution of root morphology.

AB The spatial pattern of initial introductions of marine alien species in the European Seas (including the entire Mediterranean) was investigated. Marked geographic patterns depending on the pathway of introduction were revealed, with specific countries acting as gateways to alien invasions. France and Italy were the countries mostly responsible for introductions by aquaculture, while Lessepsian species were first reported (as anticipated) in the countries of the Levantine Sea, especially Israel. Shipping was the most important pathway of introduction, with a widely dispersed geographic pattern of initial introductions, especially near large ports. Certain taxonomic groups were mostly introduced by specific pathways, and hence the taxonomic identity of the introduced alien species in each region was greatly dependent on the dominant maritime activities/interventions and the related pathways of introduction. Our data can be very useful for informing and supporting national policy and management decisions necessary to prevent future introductions of marine alien species.

AB We investigated the relationships of net ecosystem carbon exchange (NEE), soil temperature, and moisture with soil respiration rate and its components at a grassland ecosystem. Stable carbon isotopes were used to separate soil respiration into autotrophic and heterotrophic components within an eddy covariance footprint during the 2008 and 2009 growing seasons. After correction for self-correlation, rates of soil respiration and its autotrophic and heterotrophic components for both years were found to be strongly influenced by variations in daytime NEE the amount of C retained in the ecosystem during the daytime, as derived from NEE measurements when photosynthetically active radiation was above 0 similar to mu mol similar to m-2 similar to s-1. The time scale for correlation of variations in daytime NEE with fluctuations in respiration was longer for heterotrophic respiration (3642 similar to days) than for autotrophic respiration (46 similar to days). In addition to daytime NEE, autotrophic respiration was also sensitive to soil moisture but not soil temperature. In contrast, heterotrophic respiration from soils was sensitive to changes in soil temperature, soil moisture, and daytime NEE. Our results show that as for forests plant activity is an important driver of both components of soil respiration in this tallgrass prairie grassland ecosystem. Heterotrophic respiration had a slower coupling with plant activity than did autotrophic respiration. Our findings suggest that the frequently observed variations in the sensitivity of soil respiration to temperature or moisture may stem from variations in the proportions of autotrophic and heterotrophic components of soil respiration. Rates of photosynthesis at seasonal time scales should also be considered as a driver of both autotrophic and heterotrophic soil respiration for ecosystem flux modeling.

AB Aim A common strategy for conserving biodiversity in fire-prone environments is to maintain a diversity of post-fire age classes at the landscape scale, under the assumption that pyrodiversity begets biodiversity. Another strategy is to maintain extensive areas of a particular seral state regarded as vital for the persistence of threatened species, under the assumption that this will also cater for the habitat needs of other species. We investigated the likely effects of these strategies on bird assemblages in tree mallee vegetation, characterized by multi-stemmed Eucalyptus species, where both strategies are currently employed.
   Location The semi-arid Murray Mallee region of south-eastern Australia.
   Methods We systematically surveyed birds in 26 landscapes (each 4-km diameter), selected to represent gradients in the diversity of fire age classes and the proportion of older vegetation (> 35 years since fire). Additional variables were measured to represent underlying vegetation-or fire-mediated properties of the landscape, as well as its biogeographic context. We used an informationtheoretic approach to investigate the relationships between these predictor variables and the species richness of birds (total species, threatened species and rare species).
   Results Species richness of birds was not strongly associated with fire-mediated heterogeneity. Species richness was associated with increasing amounts of older vegetation in landscapes, but not with the proportion of recently burned vegetation in landscapes.
   Main conclusions The preference of many mallee birds for older vegetation highlights the risk of a blanket application of the ` pyrodiversity begets biodiversity' paradigm. If application of this paradigm involved converting large areas from long unburned to recently burned vegetation to increase firemediated heterogeneity in tree mallee landscapes, our findings suggest that this could threaten birds. This research highlights the value of adopting a landscapescale perspective when evaluating the utility of fire-management strategies intended to benefit biodiversity.

AB The goal of this paper is to help managers better understand implications of using aggregate community metrics, such as taxon richness or Indices of Biotic Integrity (IBI), for detecting threshold responses to anthropogenic environmental gradients. To illustrate, we offer an alternative analytical approach, Threshold Indicator Taxa ANalysis (TITAN), geared toward identifying synchronous changes in the distribution of multiple taxa as evidence of an ecological community threshold. Our approach underscores the fundamental reality that which taxa are affected by stressors is important, both from a conservation standpoint and because taxon-specific life-history traits help us understand relevant mechanisms. First, we examine macroinvertebrate community response to an impervious cover gradient using a well-studied biomonitoring data set to show that representative community metrics are relatively insensitive to synchronous threshold declines of numerous individual taxa. We then reproduce these response relationships using a simulated community data set with similar properties to demonstrate that linear or wedge-shaped responses of community metrics to anthropogenic gradients can occur as an artifact of aggregating multiple taxa into a single value per sampling unit, despite strong nonlinearity in community response. Our findings do not repudiate the use of community metrics or multimetric indices, but they challenge assumptions that such metrics are capable of accurately reflecting community thresholds across a broad range of anthropogenic gradients. We recommend an alternative analysis framework that begins with characterization of the responses of individual taxa and uses aggregation only after distinguishing the magnitude, direction, and uncertainty in the responses of individual members of the community.

AB The diversity on coral reefs has long captivated observers. We examine the mechanisms of speciation, role of ecology in speciation, and patterns of species distribution in a typical reef-associated clade-the diverse and colorful Calcinus hermit crabs-to address the origin of tropical marine diversity. We sequenced COI, 16S, and H3 gene regions for similar to 90% of 56 putative species, including nine undescribed, "cryptic" taxa, and mapped their distributions. Speciation in Calcinus is largely peripatric at remote locations. Allopatric species pairs are younger than sympatric ones, and molecular clock analyses suggest that > 2 million years are needed for secondary sympatry. Substantial niche conservatism is evident within clades, as well as a few major ecological shifts between sister species. Color patterns follow species boundaries and evolve rapidly, suggesting a role in species recognition. Most species prefer and several are restricted to oceanic areas, suggesting great dispersal abilities and giving rise to an ocean-centric diversity pattern. Calcinus diversity patterns are atypical in that the diversity peaks in the west-central oceanic Pacific rather than in the Indo-Malayan "diversity center." Calcinus speciation patterns do not match well-worn models put forth to explain the origin of Indo-West Pacific diversity, but underscore the complexity of marine diversification.

AB Hydrologic variability is important in sustaining a variety of ecological processes in streams and rivers. Natural flow regime classifications group streams and rivers that are relatively homogeneous with respect to flow variability and have been promoted as a method of defining units for management of river flows. Although there has been considerable interest in classifying natural flow regimes, there has been less emphasis given to developing accurate methods of extrapolating these classifications to locations without flow data. We developed a method of mapping flow regime classes using boosted regression trees (BRT) that automatically fits non-linear functions and interactions between explanatory variables of flow regimes, both of which can be expected when comparing responses between complex systems such as watersheds. A natural flow regimes classification of continental France was developed from cluster analysis of 157 hydrological indices derived from 763 gauging stations representing unmodified flows. BRT models were used to predict the likelihood of gauging stations belonging to each class based on the watershed characteristics. These models were used to extrapolate the natural flow regime classification to all segments of a national river network. The performance of the BRT models were compared with other methods of assigning locations to flow regime classes, including the use of geographically contiguous regions, linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and classification and regression trees (CART). The "fitted" misclassification rate (associated with model fits) for assignment based on the BRT models was 13% whereas the fitted misclassification rates for geographically contiguous regions, LDA and CART were 52%, 44% and 39%, respectively. A "predictive" misclassification rate (calculated for new cases) was estimated for assignments based on the BRT, LDA and CART models using cross validation analysis. For assignment based on the BRT models, the mean predictive misclassification rate was 37% whereas for LDA and CART it was 45% and 64%, respectively. Our method of mapping flow regimes could increase the confidence in decisions associated with setting environmental flows and the ability to undertake broad-scale ecohydrological research.

AB This manuscript discusses the role of fishers' Local Ecological Knowledge (LEK) in the management of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) in Brazil. Semi-structured interviews were undertaken at nine MPAs to investigate MPA managers' (n=9) and higher governmental level authorities' (n=5) perceptions on these. Varying levels of MPA governance approaches were assessed, from government-led centralized top-down (e.g. marine biological reserves) to community-based bottom-up MPA categories (e.g. marine extractive reserves). The use of fishers' LEK was found to be an essential means of achieving a broader and more diverse knowledge basis for MPA management, though most of the management current in place is still science-driven in Brazil. The full engagement of local knowledge can also be regarded as a means of empowering local communities and promoting responsibility, but only if a more inclusive praxis of participation is put to work. Different meanings for 'Local Knowledge Use' in MPA management were outlined and described for different management approaches (top-down vs. bottom-up). It was noted that each of these meanings brings different outcomes in terms of stakeholder participation and empowerment. It is also suggested that MPA co-management schemes might benefit from the adoption of a 'knowledge-building' instead of 'knowledge-using' approach during a 'problem-solving' instead of 'decision-making' management process. Finally, it is concluded that it will be an enormous challenge to put LEK to work in the benefit of MPAs in the country amidst so many priority actions brought by the problems affecting the Brazilian National System of MPAs. Government must open up the agenda to deliberatively discuss the roles of local knowledge in MPA management, whilst local communities organise themselves and increase the demand for participation with responsibility.

   IDENTIFICATION
AB Background: Molecular sequence data have become the standard in modern day phylogenetics. In particular, several long-standing questions of mammalian evolutionary history have been recently resolved thanks to the use of molecular characters. Yet, most studies have focused on only a handful of standard markers. The availability of an ever increasing number of whole genome sequences is a golden mine for modern systematics. Genomic data now provide the opportunity to select new markers that are potentially relevant for further resolving branches of the mammalian phylogenetic tree at various taxonomic levels.
   Description: The EnsEMBL database was used to determine a set of orthologous genes from 12 available complete mammalian genomes. As targets for possible amplification and sequencing in additional taxa, more than 3,000 exons of length > 400 bp have been selected, among which 118, 368, 608, and 674 are respectively retrieved for 12, 11, 10, and 9 species. A bioinformatic pipeline has been developed to provide evolutionary descriptors for these candidate markers in order to assess their potential phylogenetic utility. The resulting OrthoMaM (Orthologous Mammalian Markers) database can be queried and alignments can be downloaded through a dedicated web interface http://kimura.univ-montp2.fr/orthomam.
   Conclusion: The importance of marker choice in phylogenetic studies has long been stressed. Our database centered on complete genome information now makes possible to select promising markers to a given phylogenetic question or a systematic framework by querying a number of evolutionary descriptors. The usefulness of the database is illustrated with two biological examples. First, two potentially useful markers were identified for rodent systematics based on relevant evolutionary parameters and sequenced in additional species. Second, a complete, gapless 94 kb supermatrix of 118 orthologous exons was assembled for 12 mammals. Phylogenetic analyses using probabilistic methods unambiguously supported the new placental phylogeny by retrieving the monophyly of Glires, Euarchontoglires, Laurasiatheria, and Boreoeutheria. Muroid rodents thus do not represent a basal placental lineage as it was mistakenly reasserted in some recent phylogenomic analyses based on fewer taxa. We expect the OrthoMaM database to be useful for further resolving the phylogenetic tree of placental mammals and for better understanding the evolutionary dynamics of their genomes, i.e., the forces that shaped coding sequences in terms of selective constraints.

AB This study combines niche modeling and systematic area prioritization using distribution data for 131 species of amphibians and reptiles from Northeast India and Burma, with two objectives: (i) to evaluate the performance of the current conservation area network in Northeast India with respect to the representation of amphibians and reptiles, and (ii) to identify potential areas for expanding the current conservation area network. In a two-step protocol, maximum entropy niche modeling was used to project species' potential geographic occurrences, and the resulting probabilistic distribution data were used to prioritize areas with algorithms that maximize the representation of all species in minimal total area. The results provided a critical assessment of conservation priorities in this data-deficient region, and indicate the utility of combining niche modeling with systematic area prioritization in such situations. Many areas that had been overlooked in previous assessments were identified. Although the existing protected areas were found to be inadequate for representation of amphibian and reptile diversity, the prioritization results show that by targeting a minimal representation of 5% of the current total area suitable for each species, the gaps can be filled with a relatively modest (0.41%) increase in the current total area covered by the network. Extended analyses were also performed to assess the effects of putatively rare species on reserve selection, which showed that the inclusion of these taxa can change the prioritization solutions significantly. The prioritization results also highlight areas of Northeast India that warrant attention from future surveys. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Chlorophyll (Chl) and epidermal polyphenol (EPhen) contents were estimated in vivo using two optical leaf-clips, SPAD-502 and Dualex, respectively. The area-based measurements were transformed into mass-based data by taking into account the leaf dry mass per area (LMA). Measurements were performed on forest trees and on saplings grown under controlled conditions. While LMA increased with irradiance along a vertical transect in a beech canopy or in saplings grown under different and increasing irradiance levels, mass-based EPhen (EPhen(m)) increased, whereas mass-based Chl (Chl(m)) decreased. This was a signature of a gradual switch of investment from protein into polyphenol production. A similar signature was obtained in saplings grown on nitrogen-deficient soil with respect to fertilized controls. However, nitrogen effects remained moderate compared to irradiance-induced effects. EPhen(m) and Chl(m) both declined with plant ageing-induced increases in LMA, under all tested growth conditions. This was a signature of an accumulation of dry matter that diluted Chl and EPhen. The described competition between Chl and EPhen in leaves fits well with the predictions of the Protein Competition Model (PCM), that is, that the total leaf mass-based polyphenols content (Phen(t)) is controlled by the competition between protein and polyphenol biosynthetic pathways and its metabolic regulation.

AB Species status assessment and the conservation of biological diversity may require defining units below the species level to portray probabilities of extinction accurately and to help set priorities for conservation efforts. What those units should be has been debated in the scientific literature largely in terms of evolutionarily significant units (ESUs), but this discourse has bad little impact on government policy with regard to status assessment. As with species concepts, the variously proposed ESU concept, have not been resolvable into a single approach. The need for a practicable procedure to identify infraspecific entities for status assignment is The motivation behind employing designatable units (DUs). In aid of a policy to prevent elements of biodiversity from becoming extinct or extirpated, DUs arc, determined during the process of resolving a specics' conservation status according to broadly applicable guidelines. The procedure asks whether putative DUs are distinguishable based oil a reliably established taxonomy or a well-corroborated phylogeny compelling evidence of genetic distinction, range disjunction, and/or biogeographic distinction as long as extinction probabilities also differ The language of the DU approach avoids wording that implies value judgments concerning evolutionary importance or significance. Because species conservation status assessment is not science but, rather; the use of science to further policy DUs contribute to a precautionary approach to listing whereby status may, be assessed even though knowledge of systematic relationships below the species level may be lacking or unresolved. The pragmatic approach of using DUs has been adopted by the Committee oil the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada for status assessment of species under the Canadian Species at Risk Act.

AB Many shorebirds travel over large sections of the globe during the course of their annual cycle and use habitats in many different biomes and climate zones. Increasing knowledge of the factors driving variations in shorebird numbers, phenotype and behaviour may allow shorebirds to serve as 'integrative sentinels' of global environmental change. On the basis of numbers, timing of migration, plumage status and body mass, shorebirds could indicate whether ecological and climate systems are generally intact and stable at hemispheric scales, or whether parts of these systems might be changing. To develop this concept, we briefly review the worldwide shorebird migration systems before examining how local weather and global climatic features affect several performance measures of long-distance migrants. What do variations in numbers, phenotype and behaviour tell us about the dependence of shorebirds on weather and climate? How does data on migrating shorebirds integrate global environmental information? Documenting the dependencies between the population processes of shorebirds and global environmental features may be an important step towards assessing the likely effects of projected climate change. In the meantime we can develop the use of aspects of shorebird life histories on large spatial and temporal scales to assay global environmental change.

AB Ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) perform the rate-limiting step of nitrification, a key ecosystem process that in part determines the fate of nitrogen in ecosystems. However, little is known about the factors that determine soil AOB diversity or composition, especially in tropical systems. Using a set of study systems in Costa Rica, we examined whether plant diversity or land-use influenced AOB diversity or composition and whether AOB diversity or composition were associated with nitrification rates. We characterized the molecular diversity and composition of AOB via polymerase chain reaction amplification, cloning, and sequencing of 16S rDNA. We found that AOB diversity or composition did not change significantly across plant diversity treatments. In contrast, AOB differed among land-use types in some measures of diversity and in composition, and differences in AOB composition among land-use types were correlated with potential rates of nitrification. Our results suggest that anthropogenic changes of ecosystems can alter microbial communities in ways that may affect the processes they mediate.

AB We assessed the utility of eight DNA sequence markers (5.8S rDNA, 18S rDNA, 28S rDNA, ITS regions, long-wavelength opsin, elongation factor I-a, cytochrome b, and cytochrome oxidase 1) in reconstructing phylogenetic relationships at various levels of divergence in gallwasps (Hymenoptera: Cynipidae), using a set of eight exemplar taxa. We report sequence divergence values and saturation levels and compare phylogenetic results of these sequences analyzed both separately and combined to a well-corroborated morphological phylogeny. Likelihood ratio tests were used to find the best evolutionary model fitting each of the markers. The likelihood model best explaining the data is, for most loci, parameter rich, with strong A-T bias for mitochondrial loci and strong rate heterogeneity for the majority of loci. Our data suggest that 28S rDNA, elongation factor 1-alpha, and long-wavelength opsin may be potentially useful markers for the resolution of cynipid and other insect within-family-level divergences (circa 50-100 mya old), whereas mitochondrial loci and ITS regions are most useful for lower-level phylogenetics. In contrast, the 18S rDNA marker is likely to be useful for the resolution of above-family-level relationships. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science (USA).

AB Wolverine (Gulo gulo) numbers in Scandinavia were significantly reduced during the early part of the century as a result of predator removal programmes and hunting. Protective legislation in both Sweden and Norway in the 1960s and 1970s has now resulted in increased wolverine densities in Scandinavia. We report here the development of 15 polymorphic microsatellite markers in wolverine and their use to examine the population sub-structure and genetic variability in free-ranging Scandinavian wolverine populations as well as in a sample of individuals collected before 1970. Significant subdivision between extant populations was discovered, in particular for the small and isolated population of southern Norway which represents a recent recolonization. Overall genetic variability was found to be,lower than previously reported for other mustelids, with only two to five alleles per locus and observed heterozygosities (H-o) ranging from 0.269 to 0.376 across the examined populations, being lowest in southern Norway Analysis of the mitochondrial DNA control region revealed no variation throughout the surveyed populations. As the historical sample did not show higher levels of genetic variability, our results are consistent with a reduction in the genetic variation in Scandinavian wolverines that pre-dates the demographic bottleneck observed during the last century. The observed subdivision between populations calls for management caution when issuing harvest quotas, especially for the geographically isolated south Norwegian population.

AB This study examined the effect of fishing on the density, biomass, species richness and overall structure of the reef fish community at two islands (Sumilon and Ape) in the Philippines from 1983 to 1993. A series of natural fishing experiments over this period involving marine reserves were monitored at each island, where estimates of fishing intensity and selectivity were available. Fishing intensity (15% and 25% of biomass removed per year at Sumilon and Ape, respectively) was high enough to affect total community biomass, but not density, significantly. Species richness was not affected significantly by fishing, except at Sumilon reserve. The fishery was relatively non-selective with most families/trophic groups caught roughly in proportion to their contribution to community biomass. Thus fishing did not alter the relative abundance of the major families/trophic groups significantly, except during a period of use of explosives and drive nets in the Sumilon reserve. At the level of family/trophic group the community displayed strong resilience of structure. There was little evidence of secondary effects e.g, declines in abundance of large predators resulting in measurable increases in abundance of their prey. This resilience of the community to the effects of fishing most likely results from three important community attributes (open nature of the component populations, likely maintenance of upstream recruitment supply and apparent lack of any obvious "keystone" species or families) and one important characteristic of the fishery (relatively non-selective with respect to the components of the community).

AB In many mesic forests the dominant trees are limited concurrently by light and soil resources, and understanding the mechanisms of competition and predicting outcomes of competition are especially difficult when co-limitation exists. We altered soil resource availability during the early stages of stand development after clearcutting of northern hardwood forests to examine the mechanism of competition. Specifically, we sought empirical evidence about the role of various physiological, morphological, allocational, and architectural responses in regulating plant competition. We expected the competitive ability of the extreme pioneer species, Prunus pensylvanica (pin cherry), to be enhanced by increased nutrient supply, with consequent effects at the community and ecosystem levels of organization. Nutrient availability was increased by about three-fold by monthly fertilization for 6 yr in nine even-aged northern hardwood stands dominated by pin cherry, three each of three ages (6, 12, and 18 yr at initiation of the experiment). Measurements in the control plots indicated that the interval of stand development from age 6 to 23 yr was marked by a peak in basal area and leaf area of pin cherry at about age 17 yr, followed by a steady decline in P. pensylvanica dominance thereafter. Fertilization increased and prolonged the dominance of P. pensylvanica, indicating that nutrient limitation accelerates the demise of this species during the second and third decades of stand development.
   All species in the plots responded to fertilization with increased foliar nutrient (N, P, and K) concentrations and often higher specific leaf area (area:mass ratio), and these responses were most pronounced for P. pensylvanica. Although the light response curve for photosynthesis of P. pensylvanica was altered by fertilization, with higher rates at low light levels, photosynthesis of its principal competitor, Betula papyrifera, was not affected. The marked growth response of P. pensylvanica was accompanied by changes in its canopy architecture, as the trees had more leaf area per unit stem basal area, and proportionally more of this leaf area was in the upper canopy. In contrast, height and leaf area of B. papyrifera were similar in the control and fertilized plots. Seed deposition of P. pensylvanica also increased in the fertilized plots during one year of high seed production. Thus, the performance in competition of P. pensylvanica was improved by the removal of apparent nutrient limitations on its physiological performance, canopy growth, and ability to compete for light.
   Leaf area index of the fertilized plots was only slightly higher than the control plots, and the same was true for stand basal area. The removal of nutrient limitation increased the intensity of one-sided competition for light by concentrating the dominance among the largest trees; consequently, very high mortality of suppressed stems of all species occurred. The increased dominance of the fast-growing P. pensylvanica contributed to increases in aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) in the fertilized plots. Some of this ANPP response was probably associated with reduced C allocation to roots in some of the fertilized plots, but this pattern was not consistent across all the stands. The results indicate that the outcome of interspecific competition in mesic forests, where co-limitation by light and soil resources prevails, depends upon the effect of site quality upon the relative intensity of one-sided competition (for light).

AB The yellow-footed rock-wallaby Petrogale xanthopus is considered to be potentially vulnerable to extinction. This wallaby inhabits naturally disjunct rocky outcrops which could restrict dispersal between populations, but the extent to which that occurs is unknown. Genetic differences between populations were assessed using mitochondrial DNA (control region) sequencing and analysis of variation at four microsatellite loci among three geographically close sites in south-west Queensland (P. x. celeris) and, for mtDNA only, samples from South Australia (P. x. xanthopus) as well. Populations from South Australia and Queensland had phylogenetically distinct mtDNA, supporting the present classification of these two groups as evolutionarily distinct entities. Within Queensland, populations separated by 70 km of unsuitable habitat differed significantly for mtDNA and at microsatellite loci. Populations separated by 10 km of apparently suitable habitat had statistically homogeneous mtDNA, but a significant difference in allele frequency at one microsatellite locus. Tests for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and microgeographical variation at microsatellite loci did not detect any substructuring between two wallaby aggregations within a colony encircling a single rock outcrop. Although the present study was limited by small sample sizes at two of the three Queensland locations examined, the genetic results suggest that dispersal between colonies is limited, consistent with an ecological study of-dispersal at one of the sites. Considering both the genetic and ecological data, we suggest that management of yellow-footed rock-wallabies should treat each colony as an independent unit and that conservation of the Queensland and South Australian populations as separate entities is warranted.

Growth temperature affected the photosynthetic CO2 response curve. The relative ratio of the initial slope to the CO2-saturated photosynthesis increased with rising growth temperature. This was caused mainly by an increase in CO2-limited photosynthesis for a given leaf nitrogen content with rising growth temperature. However, there was no difference in ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase (Rubisco) content at any given leaf nitrogen content among temperature treatments. In addition, the activation state and catalytic turnover rate of Rubisco were not affected by growth temperature. The increase in CO2-limited photosynthesis with rising growth temperature was the result of an increase in the CO2 transfer conductance between the intercellular airspaces and the carboxylation sites. The amounts of total chlorophyll and light-harvesting chlorophyll alb protein II increased for the same leaf nitrogen content with rising growth temperature, but the amounts of cytochrome f and coupling factor 1 and the activities of cytosolic fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase and sucrose-phosphate synthase were the same between plants grown at 23/18 degrees C and those grown at 30/23 degrees C. similarly, CO2-saturated photosynthesis was not different for the same leaf nitrogen content between these treatments. For the 18/15 degrees C-grown plants, a slight decrease in the amounts of cytochrome f and coupling factor 1 and an increase in the activities of cytosolic fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase and sucrose-phosphate synthase were found, but these were not reflected in CO2-saturated photosynthesis.

AB The effect of strip-management on surface activity, movements and activity density of abundant carabid beetles during two vegetation periods in a cereal field was investigated using mark-recapture techniques. Significantly higher recapture rates, indicating higher activity, were found in the strip-managed area than in the control area, especially in Poecilus cupreus and also in Carabus granulatus and Pterostichus melanarius. Several observations led to the conclusion that this higher activity is generally due to a prolongation of the reproductive period in the strip-managed area. Significantly higher activity densities were found for P. cupreus, Pterostichus anthracinus, C. granulatus and Pt. melanarius in the strip-managed area than in a bordering control area. P. cupreus is greatly attracted to the strips during its migrations, as can be deduced from the high percentage of movements that contact the strips. Also, significantly more marked individuals moved from the control to the strip-managed area than vice versa. Pt. melanarius and Pt. anthracinus show less preference for the strips in their movements than P. cupreus. However, significantly more individuals of Pt. melanarius also moved from the control to the strip-managed area. C. granulatus, on the other hand, kept mainly to the cereal areas. After harvest only Pterostichus niger and Harpalus rufipes distinctly preferred the strips. The generally marked degree of attraction exercised by strip-management on carabid beetles is discussed.

AB The effects of environmental factors on water microbial communities have been extensively studied, but little is known about the effects in shrimp cultural enclosure ecosystems. We analyzed 16S rRNA gene amplicons to determine the principal environmental factors that shape the structure and function of microbial communities in shrimp cultural enclosure ecosystems from Guangdong and Hainan provinces, in China. High quality sequences were clustered into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) at the 97% similarity level, generating 659-1,835 OTUs per sample. The 10 most abundant phyla were Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Cyanobacteria, Planctomycetes, Actinobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, Firmicutes, Chlorobi, Chloroflexi, and Chlamydiae. The results of canonical correspondence analyses (CCA) indicated that salinity, total phosphate (TP), total nitrogen (TN), temperature, and pH were the most important factors shaping microbial community structure. Differences in microbial community structure between high and low salinity samples were explained by changes in the relative abundances of some OTUs (e.g., OTU5, OTU19, OTU21, OTU39, and OTU71). Moreover, the contribution of spatial distribution to the microbial community assembly was investigated via aggregated boosted tree (ABT) analyses, and the results indicated spatial isolation was not amajor factor affecting the phylogenetic diversity and phylotypes of water microbial communities. Furthermore, we predicted water microbial community functional profiling using the PICRUSt program and principal component analyses (PCA) suggested that salinity was a major contributor to the structure and function of the microbial communities. Collectively, these results showed that environmental factors influenced the structure and function of water microbial communities, while salinity was the principal environmental factor instead of temperature, TP, TN, and pH in shrimp cultural enclosure ecosystems.

AB Ecological restoration is a global priority
   Ecological restoration is a global priority that holds great potential for benefiting natural ecosystems, but restoration outcomes are notoriously unpredictable. Resolving thisunpredictability represents a major, but critical challenge to the science of restoration ecology.
   In an effort to move restoration ecology toward a more predictive science, we consider the key issue of variability. Typically, restoration outcomes vary relative to goals (i.e. reference or desired future conditions) and with respect to the outcomes of other restoration efforts. The field of restoration ecology has largely considered only this first type of variation, often focusing on an oversimplified success vs. failure dichotomy. The causes of variation, particularly among restoration efforts, remain poorly understood for most systems.
   Variation associated with restoration outcomes is a consequence of how, where and when restoration is conducted; variation is also influenced by how the outcome of restoration is measured. We propose that variation should decrease with the number of factors constraining restoration and increase with the specificity of the goal. When factors (e.g. harsh environmental conditions, limited species reintroductions) preclude most species, little variation will exist among restorations, particularly when goals are associated with metrics such as physical structure, where species may be broadly interchangeable. Conversely, when few constraints to species membership exist, substantial variation may result and this will be most pronounced when restoration is assessed by metrics such as taxonomic composition.
   Synthesis and applications. The variability we observe during restoration results from both restoration context (how, where and when restoration is conducted) and how we evaluate restoration outcomes. To advance the predictive capacity of restoration, we outline a research agenda that considers metrics of restoration outcomes, the drivers of variation among existing restoration efforts, experiments to quantify and understand variation in restoration outcomes, and the development of models to organise, interpret and forecast restoration outcomes.

AB Determining and understanding relationships between biodiversity and hydrology is a critical goal in ecology, particularly given biodiversity in the freshwater realm is in crisis. Despite the prevalence of rivers experiencing natural drying disturbances (which we collectively refer to as intermittent rivers), and projections of increased frequency and duration of drying events, the importance of drying relative to other flow-related determinants of river biodiversity remains understudied. We assessed the influence of drying on alpha- and beta-diversity using discharge and macroinveitebrate data collated from Australia and southwest Europe over broad spatial and temporal scales, providing information on current and past drying events, and combining a wide variety of flow metrics. We found clear evidence that drying acts as a strong environmental filter and is a primary hydrological determinant of alpha-diversity; even when considering both intermittent and perennial rivers, drying-event conditions were its most important predictors. Macroinvertebrate richness declined with increasing durations of drying over the long-term (Australia) and recent (Australia and southwest Europe) history of river discharge, and with decreasing predictability of event timing (Australia). Our analysis also revealed that: responses can he taxon specific due to variation in traits of resistance and resilience to drying; some taxa may respond just as or more strongly to variation in other discharge components (e.g. high- or low-flow events) than to drying; and together these phenomena may result in differing community-level responses within and across regions. Patterns of beta-diversity across the wide biogeographical range of our study suggested that convergent and divergent niche-selection processes may act in combination on aquatic communities of rivers experiencing drying, disturbances. However, strong, ability to disperse by flight (not by water) weakened beta-diversity patterning among rivers. Our findings can he used to improve understanding of biodiversity organisation in disturbed systems, notably in those with dendritic features, including intermittent rivers.

AB Species introductions are a dominant component of biodiversity change but are not explicitly included in most discussions of biodiversity-disease relationships. This is a major oversight given the multitude of effects that introduced species have on both parasitism and native hosts. Drawing on both animal and plant systems, we review the competing mechanistic pathways by which biological introductions influence parasite diversity and prevalence. While some mechanisms - such as local changes in phylogenetic composition and global homogenization - have strong explanatory potential, the net effects of introduced species, especially at local scales, remain poorly understood. Integrative, community - scale studies that explicitly incorporate introduced species are needed to make effective predictions about the effects of realistic biodiversity change and conservation action on disease.

AB Dynamic global vegetation models are used to predict the response of vegetation to climate change. They are essential for planning ecosystem management, understanding carbon cycle-climate feedbacks, and evaluating the potential impacts of climate change on global ecosystems. JULES ( the Joint UK Land Environment Simulator) represents terrestrial processes in the UK Hadley Centre family of models and in the first generation UK Earth System Model. Previously, JULES represented five plant functional types ( PFTs): broadleaf trees, needle-leaf trees, C-3 and C-4 grasses, and shrubs. This study addresses three developments in JULES. First, trees and shrubs were split into deciduous and evergreen PFTs to better represent the range of leaf life spans and metabolic capacities that exists in nature. Second, we distinguished between temperate and tropical broadleaf evergreen trees. These first two changes result in a new set of nine PFTs: tropical and temperate broadleaf evergreen trees, broadleaf deciduous trees, needle-leaf evergreen and deciduous trees, C-3 and C-4 grasses, and evergreen and deciduous shrubs. Third, using data from the TRY database, we updated the relationship between leaf nitrogen and the maximum rate of carboxylation of Rubisco ( V-cmax /, and updated the leaf turnover and growth rates to include a trade-off between leaf life span and leaf mass per unit area.
   Overall, the simulation of gross and net primary productivity ( GPP and NPP, respectively) is improved with the nine PFTs when compared to FLUXNET sites, a global GPP data set based on FLUXNET, and MODIS NPP. Compared to the standard five PFTs, the new nine PFTs simulate a higher GPP and NPP, with the exception of C-3 grasses in cold environments and C-4 grasses that were previously over-productive. On a biome scale, GPP is improved for all eight biomes evaluated and NPP is improved for most biomes - the exceptions being the tropical forests, savannahs, and extratropical mixed forests where simulated NPP is too high. With the new PFTs, the global present-day GPP and NPP are 128 and 62 Pg C year(-1), respectively. We conclude that the inclusion of trait-based data and the evergreen/deciduous distinction has substantially improved productivity fluxes in JULES, in particular the representation of GPP. These developments increase the realism of JULES, enabling higher confidence in simulations of vegetation dynamics and carbon storage.

AB To understand soil microbial community stability and temporal turnover in response to climate change, a long-term soil transplant experiment was conducted in three agricultural experiment stations over large transects from a warm temperate zone (Fengqiu station in central China) to a subtropical zone (Yingtan station in southern China) and a cold temperate zone (Hailun station in northern China). Annual soil samples were collected from these three stations from 2005 to 2011, and microbial communities were analyzed by sequencing microbial 16S ribosomal RNA gene amplicons using Illumina MiSeq technology. Our results revealed a distinctly differential pattern of microbial communities in both northward and southward transplantations, along with an increase in microbial richness with climate cooling and a corresponding decrease with climate warming. The microbial succession rate was estimated by the slope (w value) of linear regression of a log-transformed microbial community similarity with time (time-decay relationship). Compared with the low turnover rate of microbial communities in situ (w = 0.046, P < 0.001), the succession rate at the community level was significantly higher in the northward transplant (w = 0.058, P < 0.001) and highest in the southward transplant (w = 0.094, P < 0.001). Climate warming lead to a faster succession rate of microbial communities as well as lower species richness and compositional changes compared with in situ and climate cooling, which may be related to the high metabolic rates and intense competition under higher temperature. This study provides new insights into the impacts of climate change on the fundamental temporal scaling of soil microbial communities and microbial phylogenetic biodiversity.

AB Ecosystems are under increasing pressure from human activities, with land use and land-use change at the forefront of the drivers that provoke global and regional biodiversity loss. The first step in addressing the challenge of how to reverse the negative outlook for the coming years starts with measuring environmental loss rates and assigning responsibilities. Pinpointing the global pressures on biodiversity is a task best addressed using holistic models such as Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). LCA is the leading method for calculating cradle-to-grave environmental impacts of products and services; it is actively promoted by many public policies, and integrated as part of environmental information systems within private companies. LCA already deals with the potential biodiversity impacts of land use, but there are significant obstacles to overcome before its models grasp the full reach of the phenomena involved. In this review, we discuss some pressing issues that need to be addressed. LCA mainly introduces biodiversity as an endpoint category modeled as a loss in species richness due to the conversion and use of land over time and space. The functional and population effects on biodiversity are mostly absent due to the emphasis on species accumulation with limited geographic and taxonomical reach. Current land-use modeling activities that use biodiversity indicators tend to oversimplify the real dynamics and complexity of the interactions of species among each other and with their habitats. To identify the main areas for improvement, we systematically reviewed LCA studies on land use that had findings related to global change and conservation ecology. We provide suggestion as to how to address some of the issues raised. Our overall objective was to encourage companies to monitor and take concrete steps to address the impacts of land use on biodiversity on a broader geographical scale and along increasingly globalized supply chains.

AB Managing fisheries resources to maintain healthy ecosystems is one of the main goals of the ecosystem approach to fisheries (EAF). While a number of international treaties call for the implementation of EAF, there are still gaps in the underlying methodology. One aspect that has received substantial scientific attention recently is fisheries-induced evolution (FIE). Increasing evidence indicates that intensive fishing has the potential to exert strong directional selection on life-history traits, behaviour, physiology, and morphology of exploited fish. Of particular concern is that reversing evolutionary responses to fishing can be much more difficult than reversing demographic or phenotypically plastic responses. Furthermore, like climate change, multiple agents cause FIE, with effects accumulating over time. Consequently, FIE may alter the utility derived from fish stocks, which in turn can modify the monetary value living aquatic resources provide to society. Quantifying and predicting the evolutionary effects of fishing is therefore important for both ecological and economic reasons. An important reason this is not happening is the lack of an appropriate assessment framework. We therefore describe the evolutionary impact assessment (EvoIA) as a structured approach for assessing the evolutionary consequences of fishing and evaluating the predicted evolutionary outcomes of alternative management options. EvoIA can contribute to EAF by clarifying how evolution may alter stock properties and ecological relations, support the precautionary approach to fisheries management by addressing a previously overlooked source of uncertainty and risk, and thus contribute to sustainable fisheries.

AB Freshwater species worldwide are experiencing dramatic declines partly attributable to ongoing climate change. It is expected that the future effects of climate change could be particularly severe in mediterranean climate (med-) regions, which host many endemic species already under great stress from the high level of human development. In this article, we review the climate and climate-induced changes in streams of med-regions and the responses of stream biota, focusing on both observed and anticipated ecological responses. We also discuss current knowledge gaps and conservation challenges. Expected climate alterations have already been observed in the last decades, and include: increased annual average air temperatures; decreased annual average precipitation; hydrologic alterations; and an increase in frequency, intensity and duration of extreme events, such as floods, droughts and fires. Recent observations, which are concordant with forecasts built, show stream biota of med-regions when facing climate changes tend to be displaced towards higher elevations and upper latitudes, communities tend to change their composition and homogenize, while some life-history traits seem to provide biota with resilience and resistance to adapt to the new conditions (as being short-lived, small, and resistant to low streamflow and desiccation). Nevertheless, such responses may be insufficient to cope with current and future environmental changes. Accurate forecasts of biotic changes and possible adaptations are difficult to obtain in med-regions mainly because of the difficulty of distinguishing disturbances due to natural variability from the effects of climate change, particularly regarding hydrology. Long-term studies are needed to disentangle such variability and improve knowledge regarding the ecological responses and the detection of early warning signals to climate change. Investments should focus on taxa beyond fish and macroinvertebrates, and in covering the less studied regions of Chile and South Africa. Scientists, policy makers and water managers must be involved in the climate change dialogue because the freshwater conservation concerns are huge.

AB Microbial diversity is generally far higher than plant diversity, but the relationship between microbial diversity and plant diversity remains enigmatic. To shed light on this problem, we examined the diversity of a key guild of root-associated microbes, that is, ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungi along a plant diversity gradient in a Chinese subtropical forest. The results indicated that EM fungal diversity was positively correlated with host plant diversity. Furthermore, this relationship was best predicted by host genus-level diversity, rather than species-level diversity or family-level diversity. The generality of this finding was extended beyond our study system through the analyses of 100 additional studies of EM fungal communities from tropical and temperate forests. Here as well, EM fungal lineage composition was significantly affected by EM plant diversity levels, and some EM fungal lineages were co-associated with some host plant genera. These results suggest a general diversity maintenance mechanism for host-specific microbes based on higher order host plant phylogenetic diversity.

AB Emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) pose a significant threat to human health, economic stability, and biodiversity. Despite this, the mechanisms underlying disease emergence are still not fully understood, and control measures rely heavily on mitigating the impact of EIDs after they have emerged. Here, we highlight the emergence of a zoonotic Henipavirus, Nipah virus, to demonstrate the interdisciplinary and macroecological approaches necessary to understand EID emergence. Previous work suggests that Nipah virus emerged due to the interaction of the wildlife reservoir (Pteropus spp. fruit bats) with intensively Managed livestock. The emergence of this and other henipaviruses involves interactions among a suite of anthropogenic environmental changes, socioeconomic factors, and changes in demography that overlay and interact with the distribution of these pathogens in their wildlife reservoirs. Here, we demonstrate how ecological niche modeling may be used to investigate the potential role of a changing climate on the future risk for Henipavirus emergence. We show that the distribution of Henipavirus reservoirs, and therefore henipaviruses, will likely change under climate change scenarios, a fundamental precondition for disease emergence in humans. We assess the variation among climate models to estimate where Henipavirus host distribution is most likely to expand, contract, or remain stable, presenting new risks for human health. We conclude that there is substantial potential to use this modeling framework to explore the distribution of wildlife hosts under a changing climate. These approaches may directly inform current and future management and surveillance strategies aiming to improve pathogen detection and, ultimately, reduce emergence risk.

AB The advent of spatially explicit capturerecapture models is changing the way ecologists analyse capturerecapture data. However, the advantages offered by these new models are not fully exploited because they can be difficult to implement. To address this need, we developed a user-friendly software package, created within the R programming environment, called SPACECAP. This package implements Bayesian spatially explicit hierarchical models to analyse spatial capturerecapture data. Given that a large number of field biologists prefer software with graphical user interfaces for analysing their data, SPACECAP is particularly useful as a tool to increase the adoption of Bayesian spatially explicit capturerecapture methods in practice.

TI Seasonal Variations of the Urban Heat Island at the Surface and the

AB The contrast of vegetation cover in urban and surrounding areas modulates the magnitude of the urban heat island (UHI). This paper examines the seasonal variations of the UHI using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), surface meteorological observations, and the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. A distinction is made between the land surface UHI observed by satellite and the near-surface UHI observed by measuring the air temperature. The land surface UHI is found to be high at night throughout the year but drops during the wet season. The daytime UHI is low or even exhibits an urban cool island throughout the year but increases during the wet season. The near-surface air temperature UHI trend is similar to the land surface temperature UHI at night. By day, however, the air temperature UHI remains constant throughout the year. Regression analysis showed that the daytime land surface UHI correlates with the difference in vegetation fraction between the urban and surrounding areas, and, to a lesser extent, with daytime insolation. At night, the UHI correlates with nighttime atmospheric stability and only weakly with differences in vegetation cover and daytime insolation. WRF simulations with the single-layer Urban Canopy Model were initialized with MODIS data, especially for the urban fraction parameter. The simulations correctly represented the distinct seasonal variations of both types of UHIs. The model was used to test the impact of changes in vegetation fraction in the urban area, indicating that increased vegetation would reduce both the land surface UHI and the air temperature UHI at night, as well as the land surface UHI during the daytime.

AB Population fragmentation compromises population viability, reduces a species ability to respond to climate change, and ultimately may reduce biodiversity. We studied the current state and potential causes of fragmentation in grizzly bears over approximately 1,000,000 km(2) of western Canada, the northern United States (US), and southeast Alaska. We compiled much of our data from projects undertaken with a variety of research objectives including population estimation and trend, landscape fragmentation, habitat selection, vital rates, and response to human development. Our primary analytical techniques stemmed from genetic analysis of 3,134 bears, supplemented with radiotelemetry data from 792 bears. We used 15 locus microsatellite data coupled with measures of genetic distance, isolation-by-distance (IBD) analysis, analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), linear multiple regression, multi-factorial correspondence analysis (to identify population divisions or fractures with no a priori assumption of group membership), and population-assignment methods to detect individual migrants between immediately adjacent areas. These data corroborated observations of inter-area movements from our telemetry database. In northern areas, we found a spatial genetic pattern of IBD, although there was evidence of natural fragmentation from the rugged heavily glaciated coast mountains of British Columbia (BC) and the Yukon. These results contrasted with the spatial pattern of fragmentation in more southern parts of their distribution. Near the Canada-US border area, we found extensive fragmentation that corresponded to settled mountain valleys and major highways. Genetic distances across developed valleys were elevated relative to those across undeveloped valleys in central and northern BC. In disturbed areas, most inter-area movements detected were made by male bears, with few female migrants identified. Northsouth movements within mountain ranges (Mts) and across BC Highway 3 were more common than eastwest movements across settled mountain valleys separating Mts. Our results suggest that relatively distinct subpopulations exist in this region, including the Cabinet, Selkirk South, and the decades-isolated Yellowstone populations. Current movement rates do not appear sufficient to consider the subpopulations we identify along the Canada-US border as 1 inter-breeding unit. Although we detected enough male movement to mediate gene flow, the current low rate of female movement detected among areas is insufficient to provide a demographic rescue effect between areas in the immediate future (0-15 yr). In Alberta, we found fragmentation corresponded to major eastwest highways (Highways 3, 11, 16, and 43) and most inter-area movements were made by males. Gene flow and movement rates between Alberta and BC were highest across the Continental Divide south of Highway 1 and north of Highway 16. In the central region between Highways 1 and 11, we found evidence of natural fragmentation associated with the extensive glaciers and icefields along the Continental Divide. The discontinuities that we identified would form appropriate boundaries for management units. We related sex-specific movement rates between adjacent areas to several metrics of human use (highway traffic, settlement, and human-caused mortality) to understand the causes of fragmentation. This analysis used data from 1,508 bears sampled over a 161,500-km(2) area in southeastern BC, western Alberta, northern Idaho, and northern Montana during 1979-2007.
   This area was bisected by numerous humantransportation and settlement corridors of varying intensity and complexity. We used multiple linear regression and ANCOVA to document the responses of female and male bears to disturbance. Males and females both demonstrated reduced movement rates with increasing settlement and traffic. However, females reduced their movement rates dramatically when settlement increased to >20% of the fracture zone. At this same threshold, male movement declined more gradually, in response to increased traffic and further settlement. In highly settled areas (>50%), both sexes had a similar reduction in movements in response to traffic, settlement, and mortality. We documented several small bear populations with male-only immigration, highlighting the importance of investigating sex-specific movements. Without female connectivity, small populations are not viable over the long term. The persistence of this regional female fragmented metapopulation likely will require strategic connectivity management. We therefore recommend enhancing female connectivity among fractured areas by securing linkage-zone habitat appropriate for female dispersal, and ensuring current large source subpopulations remain intact. The fragmentation we documented may also affect other species with similar ecological characteristics: sparse densities, slow reproduction, short male-biased dispersal, and a susceptibility to human-caused mortality and habitat degradation. Therefore, regional inter-jurisdictional efforts to manage broad landscapes for inter-area movement will likely benefit a broad spectrum of species and natural processes, particularly in light of climate change.

AB Skill-selected global climate models were used to explore the effect of future climate change on regional bushfire weather in eastern Australia. Daily Forest Fire Danger Index (FFDI) was calculated in four regions of differing rainfall seasonality for the 20th century, 2050 and 2100 using the A2 scenario from the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios. Projected changes in FFDI vary along a latitudinal gradient. In summer rainfall-dominated tropical north-east Australia, mean and extreme FFDI are projected to decrease or remain close to 20th century levels. In the uniform and winter rainfall regions, which occupy south-east continental Australia, FFDI is projected to increase strongly by 2100. Projections fall between these two extremes for the summer rainfall region, which lies between the uniform and summer tropical rainfall zones. Based on these changes in fire weather, the fire season is projected to start earlier in the uniform and winter rainfall regions, potentially leading to a longer overall fire season.

AB If species distribution models (SDMs) can rank habitat suitability at a local scale, they may be a valuable conservation planning tool for rare, patchily distributed species. This study assessed the ability of Maxent, an SDM reported to be appropriate for modeling rare species, to rank habitat suitability at a local scale for four edaphic endemic rare plants of gabbroic soils in El Dorado County, California, and examined the effects of grain size, spatial extent, and fine-grain environmental predictors on local-scale model accuracy. Models were developed using species occurrence data mapped on public lands and were evaluated using an independent data set of presence and absence locations on surrounding lands, mimicking a typical conservation-planning scenario that prioritizes potential habitat on unsurveyed lands surrounding known occurrences. Maxent produced models that were successful at discriminating between suitable and unsuitable habitat at the local scale for all four species, and predicted habitat suitability values were proportional to likelihood of occurrence or population abundance for three of four species. Unfortunately, models with the best discrimination (i.e., AUC) were not always the most useful for ranking habitat suitability. The use of independent test data showed metrics that were valuable for evaluating which variables and model choices (e.g., grain, extent) to use in guiding habitat prioritization for conservation of these species. A goodness-of-fit test was used to determine whether habitat suitability values ranked habitat suitability on a continuous scale. If they did not, a minimum acceptable error predicted area criterion was used to determine the threshold for classifying habitat as suitable or unsuitable. I found a trade-off between model extent and the use of fine-grain environmental variables: goodness of fit was improved at larger extents, and fine-grain environmental variables improved local-scale accuracy, but fine-grain variables were not available at large extents. No single model met all habitat prioritization criteria, and the best models were overlaid to identify consensus areas of high suitability. Although the four species modeled here co-occur and are treated together for conservation planning, model accuracy and predicted suitable areas varied among species.

AB Understanding the influence of large and small-scale heterogeneity on species distribution and abundance is one of the major foci of landscape ecology research in fragmented environments. Although a large number of studies have addressed this issue individually, little effort has been made to synthesize the vast amount of literature published in the last decade. We reviewed 122 focal patch studies on 954 species published between 1998 and 2009 to determine the probability of species responding significantly to landscape, patch, and within-patch variables. We assessed the influence of taxonomic, life history, and methodological variables on probability of response to these 3 levels. Species in diverse taxa responded at high rates to factors at all three levels, suggesting that a multi-level approach is often necessary for understanding species response in patchy systems. Mammals responded at particularly high rates to landscape variables and therefore may benefit more than other taxa from landscape-level conservation efforts in fragmented environments. The probability of detecting a species response to landscape context, patch, and within-patch factors was influenced by a variety of methodological aspects of the studies such as type of landscape metric used, type of response variable, and sample size. Study design issues rarely are discussed by authors as reasons why a particular study did not find an effect of a variable, but should be given more consideration in future studies.

AB DNA-based mark-recapture has become a methodological cornerstone of research focused on bear species. The objective of such studies is often to estimate population size; however, doing so is frequently complicated by movement of individual bears. Movement affects the probability of detection and the assumption of closure of the population required in most models. To mitigate the bias caused by movement of individuals, population size and density estimates are often adjusted using ad hoc methods, including buffering the minimum polygon of the trapping array. We used a hierarchical, spatial capture-recapture model that contains explicit components for the spatial-point process that governs the distribution of individuals and their exposure to (via movement), and detection by, traps. We modeled detection probability as a function of each individual's distance to the trap and an indicator variable for previous capture to account for possible behavioral responses. We applied our model to a 2006 hair-snare study of a black bear (Ursus americanus) population in northern New York, USA. Based on the microsatellite marker analysis of collected hair samples, 47 individuals were identified. We estimated mean density at 0.20 bears/km(2). A positive estimate of the indicator variable suggests that bears are attracted to baited sites; therefore, including a trap-dependence covariate is important when using bait to attract individuals. Bayesian analysis of the model was implemented in WinBUGS, and we provide the model specification. The model can be applied to any spatially organized trapping array (hair snares, camera traps, mist nests, etc.) to estimate density and can also account for heterogeneity and covariate information at the trap or individual level.

AB Photosynthetic capacity is known to vary considerably among species. Its physiological cause and ecological significance have been one of the most fundamental questions in plant ecophysiology. We studied the contents of Rubisco (a key enzyme of photosynthesis) and cell walls in leaves of 26 species with a large variation in photosynthetic rates. We focused on photosynthetic nitrogen-use efficiency (PNUE, photosynthetic rate per nitrogen), which can be expressed as the product of Rubisco-use efficiency (RBUE, photosynthetic rate per Rubisco) and Rubisco nitrogen fraction (RNF, Rubisco nitrogen per total leaf nitrogen). RBUE accounted for 70% of the interspecific variation in PNUE. The variation in RBUE was ascribed partly to stomatal conductance, and other factors such as mesophyll conductance and Rubisco kinetics might also be involved. RNF was also significantly related to PNUE but the correlation was relatively weak. Cell wall nitrogen fraction (WNF, cell wall nitrogen per total leaf nitrogen) increased with increasing leaf mass per area, but there was no correlation between RNF and WNF. These results suggest that nitrogen allocation to cell walls does not explain the variation in PNUE. The difference in PNUE was not caused by a sole factor that was markedly different among species but by several factors each of which was slightly disadvantageous in low PNUE species.

AB Do tree and shrub species in an evergreen broadleaf forest show similar habitat associations across different life stages?
   A 24-ha evergreen broadleaf forest plot in a heterogeneous landscape in Gutianshan National Nature Reserve, Zhejiang Province, Eastern China.
   Species having positive associations with four habitat types (low valley, low ridge, upper valley, and upper ridge) at three life stages (sapling, juvenile, and mature stages) were compared for 60 tree and shrub species using torus-translation tests.
   A total of 117 significant positive associations with the four habitats were observed at the three life stages (43, 41, and 33 at the sapling, juvenile, and mature stages, respectively). For the 52 species significantly associated with habitats, only 16 were associated with the same habitat across all three stages. The majority of associated species at the juvenile stage (34 out of 40) were associated with the same habitat at their sapling stage, whereas half of species at the mature stage had consistent associations with the same habitat at their sapling stage. More species were associated with the upper ridge at the sapling and juvenile stages compared to the mature stage. Conversely, more species were associated with the low valley at the mature stage compared to the sapling and juvenile stages.
   Our results indicate that species ecological habitat associations can differ between developmental stages beyond 1 cm DBH, as most species habitat preferences were consistent from the sapling stage to the juvenile stage but changed at the mature stage.

AB Leaf chemical and spectral properties of 162 canopy species were measured at 11 tropical forest sites along a 6024 mm precipitation/yr and 8.7 degrees C climate gradient in Queensland, Australia. We found that variations in foliar nitrogen, phosphorus, chlorophyll a and b, and carotenoid concentrations, as well as specific leaf area (SLA), were expressed more strongly among species within a site than along the entire climate gradient. Integrated chemical signatures consisting of all leaf properties did not aggregate well at the genus or family levels. Leaf chemical diversity was maximal in the lowland tropical forest sites with the highest temperatures and moderate precipitation levels. Cooler and wetter montane tropical forests contained species with measurably lower variation in their chemical signatures. Foliar optical properties measured from 400 to 2500 nm were also highly diverse at the species level, and were well correlated with an ensemble of leaf chemical properties and SLA (r(2) = 0.54-0.83).
   A probabilistic diversity model amplified the leaf chemical differences among species, revealing that lowland tropical forests maintain a chemical diversity per unit richness far greater than that of higher elevation forests in Australia. Modeled patterns in spectral diversity and species richness paralleled those of chemical diversity, demonstrating a linkage between the taxonomic and remotely sensed properties of tropical forest canopies. We conclude that species are the taxonomic unit causing chemical variance in Australian tropical forest canopies, and thus ecological and remote sensing studies should consider the role that species play in de. ning the functional properties of these forests.

AB was spring and autumn for the sites characterized by summer droughts (southern sites) and (peak) summer for the Alpine and northern study sites. This general pattern was interrupted by grassland management practices, that is, mowing and grazing, when the variability in NEE explained by PPFD decreased in concert with the amount of aboveground biomass (BMag). Temperature was the abiotic influence factor that explained most of the variability in ecosystem respiration at the Alpine and northern study sites, but not at the southern sites characterized by a pronouncedThe net ecosystem carbon dioxide (CO2) exchange (NEE) of nine European mountain grassland ecosystems was measured during 2002-2004 using the eddy covariance method. Overall, the availability of photosynthetically active radiation (PPFD) was the single most important abiotic influence factor for NEE. Its role changed markedly during the course of the season, PPFD being a better predictor for NEE during periods favorable for CO2 uptake, which summer drought, where soil water availability and the amount of aboveground biomass were more or equally important. The amount of assimilating plant area was the single most important biotic variable determining the maximum ecosystem carbon uptake potential, that is, the NEE at saturating PPFD. Good correspondence, in terms of the magnitude of NEE, was observed with many (semi-) natural grasslands around the world, but not with grasslands sown on fertile soils in lowland locations, which exhibited higher maximum carbon gains at lower respiratory costs. It is concluded that, through triggering rapid changes in the amount and area of the aboveground plant matter, the timing and frequency of land management practices is crucial for the short-term sensitivity of the NEE of the investigated mountain grassland ecosystems to climatic drivers.

AB The objective of this study was to assess genotypic variation in soybean chlorophyll (Chl) content and composition, and to test if these data could be used as a rapid screening method to predict genotypic variation in leaf tissue N content. Chl contents and composition were examined among 833 soybean (Glycine max L. Merr.) accessions and related to SPAD meter readings and leaf N content. In the initial year of the study (2002), the relationship between leaf Chl and leaf N contents (r(2) = 0.043) was not sufficiently close for Chl to be useful as a predictive tool for leaf N content. Therefore, leaf N content was not determined in 2004 but samples were again collected for determination of Chl content and composition. In 2002, the soybean accessions separated into two distinct groups according to leaf Chl a/b ratios, with the majority of a mean ratio of 3.79. However, approximately 7 % (60) of the genotypes could be readily assigned to a group with a mean Chl a/b ratio of 2.67. Chl a/b analyses in 2004 confirmed the results obtained in 2002 and of 202 genotypes, all but 6 fell into the same group as in 2002.

AB There is growing interest in understanding the linkages between above- and belowground communities, and very little is known about these linkages in tropical systems. Using an experimental site at La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica, we examined whether plant diversity, plant community composition, and season influenced microbial communities. We also determined whether soil characteristics were related to differences in microbial communities. Phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) composition revealed that microbial community composition differed across a plant diversity gradient (plots contained 1, 3, 5, or over 25 species). Plant species identity also was a factor influencing microbial community composition; PLFA composition significantly varied among monocultures, and among three-species combinations that differed in plant species composition. Differences among treatments within each of these comparisons were apparent in all four sampling dates of the study. There was no consistent shift in microbial community composition between wet and dry seasons, although we did see significant changes over time. Of all measured soil characteristics, soil C/N was most often associated with changes in microbial community composition across treatment groups. Our findings provide evidence for human alteration of soil microbial communities via the alteration of plant community composition and diversity and that such changes are mediated in part by changes in soil carbon quality.

AB Genetic studies have highlighted cryptic diversity in many well-known taxa including aquatic insects, with the general implication that there are more species than are currently recognised. Baetis rhodani Pictet are among the most widespread, abundant and ecologically important of all European mayflies (Ephemeroptera), and used widely as biological indicators of stream quality. Traditional taxonomy and systematics have never fully resolved differences among suspected cryptic species in the B. rhodani complex because morphological characters alone do not allow reliable distinction. This is particularly true among larvae, the life-stage used most widely in monitoring. Here, we assess the molecular diversity of this complex in one of the largest such studies of cryptic species in the order Ephemeroptera to date. Phylogenies were constructed using data from the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) gene. Two monophyletic groups were recovered consisting of one major haplogroup and a second clade of 6 smaller but distinct haplogroups. Haplogroup divergence ranged from 0.2-3% (within) to 8-19% (among) with the latter values surpassing maxima typically reported for other insects, and provides strong evidence for cryptic species in the B. rhodani complex. The taxonomic status of these seven haplogroups remains undefined. Their distributions across Western Europe reveal no obvious geographic pattern, suggesting widespread diffusion of genetic lineages since the last glacial maximum. The implications of these findings are far-reaching given the ecological and bioindicator significance of what now appears to be several taxa. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB There is increasing evidence that large scale climate variation influences reproductive parameters of seabirds, but fewer studies have investigated possible effects on adult survival. Previous work has shown that climate variation reflected by the winter North Atlantic oscillation (WNAO) influences reproductive success in northern fulmars. Here, we use a 34 year long (1962-1995) individual-based data set to investigate inter-annual and inter-individual variation in adult survival in this species. Breeding success in the previous and current seasons, and both the WNAO and one-year lagged WNAO indexes, were considered as potential sources of inter-annual variation in survival and recapture probabilities. Sex and an index of body size were considered as potential sources of inter-individual variation in survival and recapture probabilities. Body size effects were not significant, but males and females differed in both their survival and recapture probabilities. Probability of recapture of females was positively correlated with breeding success in both the current and previous breeding seasons, whereas male recapture probabilities were correlated only with previous breeding success. Male and female survival decreased over the study period, suggesting that there had been a degradation of environmental conditions. This hypothesis was supported by the detection of a negative correlation between survival and the WNAO, which, in turn, showed a positive increase over this period. The negative correlation between female adult survival and WNAO did not result only from the long term behaviour of the two time series, but persisted for higher frequency fluctuations. In contrast, the correlation between male survival and WNAO seemed to result only from the long term behaviour of the two time series. Despite uncertainties over causal mechanisms, these findings add to the body of evidence that large scale climate variation could dramatically affect seabird population dynamics. Furthermore our results suggest that climate variation can differentially influence individuals with distinct phenotypic characteristics.

AB Disjunctive distributions across paleotropical regions in the Indian Ocean Basin (IOB) often invoke dispersal/vicariance debates. Exacum (Gentianaceae, tribe Exaceae) species are spread around the IOB, in Africa, Madagascar, Socotra, the Arabian peninsula, Sri Lanka, India, the Himalayas, mainland Southeast Asia including southern China and Malaysia, and northern Australia. The distribution of this genus was suggested to be a typical example of vicariance resulting from the breakup of the Gondwanan supercontinent. The molecular phylogeny of Exacion is in principle congruent with morphological conclusions and shows a pattern that resembles a vicariance scenario with rapid divergence among lineages, but our molecular dating analysis demonstrates that the radiation is too recent to be associated with the Gondwanan continental breakup. We used our dating analysis to test the results of DIVA and found that the program predicted impossible vicariance events. Ancestral area reconstruction suggests that Exacum originated in Madagascar, and divergence dating suggests its origin was not before the Eocene. The Madagascan progenitor, the most recent common ancestor of Exacion, colonized Sri Lanka and southern India via long-distance dispersals. This colonizer underwent an extensive range expansion and spread to Socotra-Arabia, northern India, and mainland Southeast Asia in the northern IOB when it was warm and humid in these regions. This widespread common ancestor retreated subsequently from most parts of these regions and survived in isolation in Socotra-Arabia, southern India-Sri Lanka, and perhaps mainland Southeast Asia, possibly as a consequence of drastic climatic changes, particularly the spreading drought during the Neogene. Secondary diversification from these surviving centers and Madagascar resulted in the extant main lineages of the genus. The vicariance-like pattern shown by the phylogeny appears to have resulted from long-distance dispersals followed by extensive range expansion and subsequent fragmentation. The extant African species E. oldenlandioides is confirmed to be recently dispersed from Madagascar.

AB The genus Acropora constitutes the most species-rich clade of hermatypic corals, and its members are important reef builders throughout their broad tropical range. In the Caribbean, acroporid populations have declined over the last 2 decades due to disease, hurricanes, predation, and bleaching episodes, and some are now subjects of conservation efforts. Genetic estimates of population connectivity and clonal structure should be part of these efforts, but such studies have been hampered by low levels of mitochondrial DNA variation in corals, and an apparent dearth of variable single-copy nuclear markers. Developing microsatellite markers in Acropora has proven especially difficult. We used Southern blotting to reveal that, indeed, some microsatellite motifs (AAC, AAG) are rare in the genome of the Caribbean species Acropora palmata. However, repeats with the motif AAT are both abundant and variable. We developed 8 polymorphic microsatellite markers for A. palmata, and performed crosses to confirm co-dominant inheritance patterns. Five of the 8 markers tested show simple Mendelian inheritance (mean observed heterozygosity = 0.84, mean number of alleles per locus = 8.6). Along with outcrossed sexual larvae, individual egg donors also produced some triploid and selfed larvae that developed normally and survived for 80 h, when the experiment was terminated. The markers reveal variation among 3 Florida populations of A. palmata and among clones within 1 of these populations. Seven of the markers amplify DNA from A. cervicornis and 8 from the hybrid A. prolifera. These markers should prove to be valuable tools for developing conservation strategies for Caribbean acroporid species.

AB We studied patterns of small mammal abundance and species richness in post-fire habitats by sampling 33 plots (225 m(2) each) representing different stages of vegetation recovery after fire. Small mammal abundance was estimated by live trapping during early spring 1999 and vegetation structure was sampled by visual estimation at the same plots. Recently-burnt areas were characterised by shrubby and herbaceous vegetation with low structural variability, and unburnt areas were characterised by well developed forest cover with high structural complexity. Small mammal abundance and species richness decreased with time elapsed since the last fire (from 5 to at least 50 years), and these differences were associated to the decreasing cover of short shrubs as the post-fire succession of plant communities advanced. However, relationships between vegetation structure and small mammals differed among areas burned in different times, with weak or negative relationship in recently burnt areas and positive and stronger relationship in unburnt areas. Furthermore, the abundance of small mammals was larger than expected from vegetation structure in plots burned recently whereas the contrary pattern was found in unburned areas. We hypothesised that the pattern observed could be related to the responses of small mammal predators to changes in vegetation and landscape structure promoted by fire. Fire-related fragmentation could have promoted the isolation of forest predators (owls and carnivores) in unburned forest patches, a fact that could have produced a higher predation pressure for small mammals. Conversely, small mammal populations would have been enhanced in early post-fire stages by lower predator numbers combined with better predator protection in areas covered by resprouting woody vegetation.

AB Field and container experiments were carried out in order to quantify root growth and dry matter partitioning of cauliflower under drought stress conditions. Drought stress did not influence allometric relationships between leaf and stem dry matter and shoot and tap root dry matter. Drought stress, however, had an impact on the sink strength of the curd, thereby curd growth was delayed and curd dry matter production was more seriously depressed by a limited water supply than total dry matter. Drought stress did not modify a linear relationship between shoot dry matter and total root length, however, the specific root length of Cauliflower was lower under drought stress conditions leading to a higher dry matter deposition in the fine root fraction. Also the vertical increment of rooting depth per degree day almost doubled Under drought stress conditions. An existing model for dry matter partitioning in cauliflower was adopted to include the effects of drought stress on dry matter partitioning to the curd. Therefore, the initial increase of the curd's sink strength was made dependent on the plants relative growth rate during the vernalisation period. Furthermore, a simple descriptive root growth model was adopted to include drought stress impact on root growth. For this purpose the increase of rooting depth per degree day and the specific root length were made dependent on the average soil water potential in the rooted soil profile. The modified model modules predicted dry matter partitioning and described the root length distribution of cauliflower Sufficiently well using total dry matter production rate as input values.

AB There is substantial debate over the criteria that should be used to group populations of a species into distinct units for conservation (e.g. evolutionarily significant units, management units, distinct population segments). However, in practice molecular genetic differentiation is often the only or main criterion used to identify such units. Most genetic studies attempting to define conservation units in animals use a single molecular marker, most often mitochondrial, and use samples from a limited number of populations throughout the species' range. Although there are many benefits to using mtDNA, certain features can cause it to show patterns of differentiation among populations that do not reflect the history of differentiation at the nuclear genome where loci controlling traits of adaptive significance presumably occur. Here we illustrate an example of such mitochondrial-nuclear discordance in a ranid frog, and show how using mtDNA or nuclear loci alone could have led to very different conservation recommendations. We also found very high genetic differentiation among populations on a local scale, and discuss the conservation implications of our results.

AB Heterogeneous patterns of species diversity are rarely linked to the processes that maintain them on spatial scales larger than tens of meters. In this study, subtidal landscapes of a New Zealand fjord were used to study the spatial patterns of epifaunal invertebrate species diversity and to test hypotheses about the mechanisms maintaining the patterns. Patterns of species diversity were quantified along 1000-m(2) sections of vertical rock wall habitat at three sites separated by 3-6 km of horizontal distance during April-August 1993. Species diversity data from random 0.25-m(2) quadrats at four depth strata (3, 5, 10, and 18 m) within a 20 x 50 m area were contoured to reveal spatial patterns at each site. General patterns consisted of localized patches of 300-660 m(2) of high diversity (i.e., H' [Shannon-Weiner diversity index] of 2.0-3.2/0.25 m(2) and S [species richness] of 28-32 species/0.25 m(2)) centered at 10 m depth. High-diversity patches, dominated by bryozoans, sponges, and ascidians, were bounded vertically by low-diversity mussel assemblages and horizontally by low-diversity assemblages dominated by encrusting calcareous algae with areas of bare rock. Vertical patterns of diversity were attributed to physical stress from a low-salinity surface layer impinging on shallow areas (e.g., 0-5 m depth) of the landscapes, while horizontal patterns could be partly attributed to large-scale landslides and severe grazing by sea urchins.
   The hypothesis that the areas of high diversity could be maintained by larval recruitment was tested by deploying an array of recruitment tiles with predator exclusion treatments. Experiments were conducted on the same spatial scale as the documented patterns of diversity (e.g., at 3, 5, 10, and 18 m depth), with tiles placed in and out of the high-diversity patches. Recruitment densities of calcareous polychaetes, bryozoans, and hydroids showed significant depth and habitat effects (i.e., in vs. out of the high-diversity areas) after 3 mo, but no significant effects of predator exclusion treatment. A positive linear relationship between species diversity and number of recruit species in adjacent areas of wall explained 27-57% of the variance. These data also suggested that the size of the high-diversity patches and location within the fjord are important factors affecting this relationship.
   We suggest that the localized patches of high diversity over hundreds of meters of continuous habitat can be maintained on temporal scales of months either by spatially limited recruitment of short-lived larvae from the patches or by recruitment near established conspecifics. Additionally, there may be a feedback mechanism involving the interaction of increased biogenic structure provided by the high-diversity patches enhancing recruitment. This feedback would then serve to maintain localized areas of high diversity within the extensive areas of low diversity on scales of hundreds to thousands of meters.

AB Seagrass meadows are often important habitats for newly recruited juvenile fishes. Although substantial effort has gone into documenting patterns of association of fishes with attributes of seagrass beds, experimental investigations of why fish use seagrass habitats are rare. We performed two short-term manipulative field experiments to test (1) the effects of food supply on growth and densities of fish, and (2) effects of predation on the density and size distribution of fish recruits, and how this varies among habitat types. Experiments were conducted in Galveston Bay, Texas, and we focused on the common estuarine fish, pinfish Lagodon rhomboides. In the first experiment, replicate artifical sea,al-ass and sand plots were either supplemented with food or left as controls. Recruitment of pinfish was significantly greater to seagrass than sand habitats; however, we detected no effect of food supplementation on the abundance of recruits in either habitat. Pinfish recruits in artifical seagrass grew at a significantly faster rate than those in sand habitats, and fish supplemented with food exhibited a greater growth rate than controls in both sand and artifical grass habitats. In our second experiment, we provided artificial seagrass and sand habitats with and without predator access. Predator access was manipulated with cages, and two-sided cages served as controls. Recruitment was significantly greater to the cage versus cage-control treatment, and this effect did not vary between habitats. In addition, the standard length of pinfish recruits was significantly larger in the predator access than in the predator exclusion treatment, suggesting size-selective predation on smaller settlers or density-dependent growth. Our results indicate that the impact of predation on pinfish recruits is equivalent in both sand and vegetated habitats, and thus differential predation does not explain the higher recruitment of pinfish to vegetated than to nonvegetated habitats. Since predators may disproportionately affect smaller fish, and a limited food resource appears to be more effectively utilized by fish in vegetated than in unvegetated habitats, we hypothesize that pinfish recruits may select vegetated habitats because high growth rates allow them to achieve a size that is relatively safe from predation more quickly.

AB We have determined the complete sequence of an Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) mitochondrial genome. The 16,696-bp genome contains the same 37 mitochondrial structural genes found in all other vertebrates analyzed, in an organization similar to that of the placental mammals. The cod mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) contains variable numbers of a 40-bp heteroplasmic tandem repeat motif located in the major noncoding region, and the sequence presented here includes four repeats. Comparison among the major noncoding region in mtDNAs from different codfishes, as well as different stock samples of Atlantic cod, reveals conserved sequence features. The central region of the noncoding region as well as a spacer region located between the tRNA(Thr) and tRNA(Pro) genes appear to be variable in sequence, and are good candidates for high-resolution markers in population studies. Atlantic cod is the first marine bony fish whose mitochondrial genome is completely sequenced.

AB Larval supply and early postsettlement mortality are crucial to the maintenance of most marine populations. Larval supply may be especially important in regulating populations of blue crabs Callinectes sapidus because many larvae could be lost during long migrations between estuaries and offshore waters. We examined the relative contributions of differential transport and habitat preferences of megalopae (postlarvae) to 5 potential nursery habitats in Mobile Bay and Mississippi Sound, Alabama, USA. Settlement in each habitat was determined daily during summer and fall for 2 yr and was related to sea surface temperature, wind stress, tides, current velocity and the lunar and tidal amplitude cycles. In 1990, most megalopae settled when winds blew megalopae onshore and tidal amplitudes were minimal. In 1991, onshore winds were light and infrequent, and megalopae settled even more densely during minimum amplitude tides. Semidaily collections of megalopae at dusk and dawn revealed that most megalopae recruit to estuaries during nocturnal flood tides, which only occur during summer and fall in this diurnal tidal regime. Thus, onshore winds facilitated transport of megalopae into estuaries episodically, but megalopae recruited regularly and abundantly during nocturnal minimum amplitude flood tides even when onshore winds were light or absent. Most megalopae were collected in the lower bay although some megalopae settled at the head of the estuary 50 km away from the baymouth. Megalopae required about 2 d to travel this distance as they became increasingly competent to settle from the plankton. Physiological tolerances may explain why most larvae settled in high salinity waters, but differences in current regimes may best explain differences in settlement among sites in the lower bay. Several types of substrate were transplanted from nursery habitats to a sandy area at the baymouth to determine whether megalopae prefer to settle in seagrass beds, marshes or unvegetated substrate once they arrive at a site. Megalopae strongly preferred to settle on vegetation, but it remains unclear whether or not they discriminate among plant types. Thus, passive delivery and habitat preferences of megalopae both may determine the initial distributions of juvenile blue crabs.

AB On many small Caribbean islands, two species of Anolis lizard coexist, but the two are typically verv different in body size. The two Anolis of St. Maarten, however, are exceptional because they are similar in size and are known to be strongly competitive. One species, A. gingivinus, appears the stronger competitor and occurs throughout the island; the other, A. wattsi, is found only in the central hills. The malarial parasite Plasmodium azurophilum very rarely infects A. wattsi, but in some locations is very common in A. gingivinus. Wherever malaria infects A. gingivinus, A. wattsi is present, but wherever malaria is absent, only A. ginyivinus occurs. This pattern of coincidence of malaria and coexistence of both Anolis is observed over distances of only a few hundred meters. The parasite infects both red and white blood celts of A. gingivinus and causes important pathology: immature erythrocytes increase in abundance, blood hemoglobin decreases.. monocytes and neutrophils increase, and infected white cells are less likely to produce acid phosphatase. These results argue that malaria mediates competition between the two species and determines the present distribution of the lizards on St. Maarten. This kind of parasite-mediated competition could be common if susceptibility to parasitic infection varies among competitors. The distribution of malaria in the Anolis of Caribbean islands suggests this parasite can play an important role in Anolis community ecology.

AB Sunflower plants (Helianthus annuus L., cv. CGL 208) were field-grown in adjacent plots of varying resource availability. Control plants received irrigation (on a 4-5 d interval) and high levels of fertilizer nitrogen. Nutrient-stress (N-stress) plants received control levels of irrigation but no nutrient amendments and were determined to be nitrogen-limited. Water-stress (H2O-stress) plants received control levels of fertilizer nitrogen, but no irrigation after approximately 6 weeks of plant growth. Both stress treatments reduced maximum and diurnal net photosynthesis (A) but resulted in different physiological or biochemical adjustments that tended to maintain or increase A per unit of resource (nitrogen or water) in shortest supply while decreasing the ratio of A per unit of abundant resource. Nutrient-stress reduced total foliar nitrogen, foliar chlorophyll, and initial and total RuBPCase activities, thereby enhancing or preserving photosynthetic nitrogen-use efficiency (NUE), defined as the maximum A observed per unit of leaf nitrogen, relative to the control and H2O-stress treatments. In addition, N-stress reduced photosynthetic water-use efficiency (WUE), defined as the ratio of A to stomatal conductance to water vapour (g). The slope of A versus g increased with H2O-stress. In addition, sunflower plants responded to H2O-stress by accumulating foliar glucose and sucrose and by exhibiting diurnal leaf wilting, which presumably provided additional improvements in photosynthetic WUE through osmoregulation and reduction of midday radiation interception respectively. Photosynthetic NUE was decreased by H2O-stress in that control levels of total nitrogen, foliar chlorophyll, and RuBPCase activities were maintained even after mean diurnal levels of A had fallen to less than 50% of the control level. We conclude that field-grown sunflower manages a trade-off between photosynthetic WUE and NUE, increasing use efficiency of the scarce resource while decreasing use efficiency of the abundant resource.

AB Nitrogen (N) is considered as one of the most important plant macronutrients and proper management of N therefore is a pre-requisite for modern agriculture. Continuous satellite-based monitoring of this key plant trait would help to understand individual crop N use efficiency and thus would enable site-specific N management. Since hyperspectral imaging sensors could provide detailed measurements of spectral signatures corresponding to the optical activity of chemical constituents, they have a theoretical advantage over multi-spectral sensing for the detection of crop N. The current study aims to provide a state-of-the-art overview of crop N retrieval methods from hyperspectral data in the agricultural sector and in the context of future satellite imaging spectroscopy missions. Over 400 studies were reviewed for this purpose, identifying those estimating mass-based N (N concentration, N%) and area-based N (N content, N-area) using hyperspectral remote sensing data. Retrieval methods of the 125 studies selected in this review can be grouped into: (1) parametric regression methods, (2) linear nonparametric regression methods or chemometrics, (3) nonlinear nonparametric regression methods or machine learning regression algorithms, (4) physically-based or radiative transfer models (RTM), (5) use of alternative data sources (sun-induced fluorescence, SIF) and (6) hybrid or combined techniques. Whereas in the last decades methods for estimation of Narea and N% from hyperspectral data have been mainly based on simple parametric regression algorithms, such as narrowband vegetation indices, there is an increasing trend of using machine learning, RTM and hybrid techniques. Within plants, N is invested in proteins and chlorophylls stored in the leaf cells, with the proteins being the major nitrogen-containing biochemical constituent. However, in most studies, the relationship between N and chlorophyll content was used to estimate crop N, focusing on the visible-near infrared (VNIR) spectral domains, and thus neglecting protein-related N and reallocation of nitrogen to non-photosynthetic compartments. Therefore, we recommend exploiting the estimation of nitrogen via the proxy of proteins using hyperspectral data and in particular the short-wave infrared (SWIR) spectral domain. We further strongly encourage a standardization of nitrogen terminology, distinguishing between N% and Narea. Moreover, the exploitation of physically-based approaches is highly recommended combined with machine learning regression algorithms, which represents an interesting perspective for future research in view of new spaceborne imaging spectroscopy sensors.

AB In the face of the growing challenges brought about by human activities, effective planning and decision-making in biodiversity and ecosystem conservation, restoration, and sustainable development are urgently needed. Ecological models can play a key role in supporting this need and helping to safeguard the natural assets that underpin human wellbeing and support life on land and below water (United Nations Sustainable Development Goals; SDG 15 & 14). The urgency and complexity of safeguarding forest (SDG 15.2) and mountain ecosystems (SDG 15.4), for example, and halting decline in biodiversity (SDG 15.5) in the Anthropocene requires a re-envisioning of how ecological models can best support the comprehensive assessments of biodiversity and its change that are required for successful action.
   A key opportunity to advance ecological modeling for both predictive and explanatory purposes arises through a collaboration between ecologists and the Earth observation community, and a close integration of remote sensing and species distribution models. Remote sensing products have the capacity to provide continuous spatiotemporal information about key factors driving the distribution of organisms, therefore improving both the use and accuracy of these models for management and planning.
   Here we first survey the literature on remote sensing data products available to ecological modelers interested in improving predictions of species range dynamics under global change. We specifically explore the key biophysical processes underlying the distribution of species in the Anthropocene including climate variability, changes in land cover, and disturbances. We then discuss potential synergies between the ecological modeling and remote sensing communities, and highlight opportunities to close the data and conceptual gaps that currently impede a more effective application of remote sensing for the monitoring and modeling of ecological systems. Specific attention is given to how potential collaborations between the two communities could lead to new opportunities to report on progress towards global agendas - such as the Agenda 2030 for sustainable development of the United Nations or the Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework of the Convention for Biological Diversity, and help guide conservation and management strategies towards sustainability.

AB The impact of land use metrics on watershed water quality is scale-dependent on a seasonal - spatial basis. Exploring the associations between land use metrics and riverine water quality provides useful information for effective land use planning for water quality security, whilst, these relationships remain poorly understood. 94 water samples covering entire tributaries in the Three Gorges Reservoir Area were collected and analyzed over the time period of 2015-2016, and consequently, multivariate statistics and empirical models were used for understanding the associations between land use metrics and water quality across multi-scales. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed significant spatial differences in water temperature (WT), potential of hydrogen (pH), dissolved oxygen (DO), total nitrogen (TN), total dissolved nitrogen (TDN), total dissolved phosphorus (TDP), TDN/TDP, nitrate nitrogen (NO3--N), ammoniacal nitrogen (NH4+ -N) and permanganate index (CODMn). Meanwhile, Oxidation-Reduction Potential (ORP), electrical conductivity (EC), DO, TN, TDN, TP, TDP, NO3--N, NH4+-N and CODMn generally appeared higher values in the dry season. Redundancy analysis (RDA) showed that the total explained variation of land use metrics on overall water quality was slightly stronger at catchment scale than at 100 m and 500 m buffer scales. The influence of land use metrics on water quality was a little stronger in the dry season than the wet season, but there were multi-spatial scale effects of different land use metrics. Our results can provide important information in land use planning and making multiple scales measures for water quality conservation. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Predictive studies are of paramount importance for biological invasions, one of the biggest threats for biodiversity. To help and better prioritize management strategies, species distribution models (SDMs) are often used to predict the potential invasive range of introduced species. Yet, SDMs have been regularly criticized, due to several strong limitations, such as violating the equilibrium assumption during the invasion process. Unfortunately, validation studies-with independent data-are too scarce to assess the predictive accuracy of SDMs in invasion biology. Yet, biological invasions allow to test SDMs usefulness, by retrospectively assessing whether they would have accurately predicted the latest ranges of invasion. Here, we assess the predictive accuracy of SDMs in predicting the expansion of invasive species. We used temporal occurrence data for the Asian hornet Vespa velutina nigrithorax, a species native to China that is invading Europe with a very fast rate. Specifically, we compared occurrence data from the last stage of invasion (independent validation points) to the climate suitability distribution predicted from models calibrated with data from the early stage of invasion. Despite the invasive species not being at equilibrium yet, the predicted climate suitability of validation points was high. SDMs can thus adequately predict the spread of V. v. nigrithorax, which appears to be-at least partially-climatically driven. In the case of V. v. nigrithorax, SDMs predictive accuracy was slightly but significantly better when models were calibrated with invasive data only, excluding native data. Although more validation studies for other invasion cases are needed to generalize our results, our findings are an important step towards validating the use of SDMs in invasion biology.

AB City dwellers have fewer opportunities to connect with nature, with urban green space (UGS) often one of the few places where this can occur. Natural environments are known to contribute to human wellbeing, although to date research has largely focused on quantifiable benefits. The less tangible benefits obtained from ecosystems have commonly been referred to as 'Cultural Ecosystem Services' (CES). However, challenges persist around the definition and measurement of CES. A qualitative review of literature was conducted to identify key characteristics of CES, challenges to CES research, and lessons for the future of UGS research. The review found that CES have tended to be characterised by intangibility and incommensurability, when perhaps the most distinguishing features are the form and extent of human-environment co-production, and association between CES and held values. Despite ongoing challenges, researchers have applied a range of methods to capture and analyse CES, including non-economic and participatory/deliberative approaches. As urbanisation increases, it is important to understand how CES from UGS affect wellbeing. The review found that attention to date has mainly focused on identifying CES but scope exists to research the effects of UGS attributes, and how the socio-cultural diversity of cities might influence co-production of CES.

AB Leaf dry mass per unit leaf area (LMA) is a central trait in ecology, but its anatomical and compositional basis has been unclear. An explicit mathematical and physical framework for quantifying the cell and tissue determinants of LMA will enable tests of their influence on species, communities and ecosystems. We present an approach to explaining LMA from the numbers, dimensions and mass densities of leaf cells and tissues, which provided unprecedented explanatory power for 11 broadleaved woody angiosperm species diverse in LMA (33-262 g m(-2); R-2 = 0.94; P < 0.001). Across these diverse species, and in a larger comparison of evergreen vs. deciduous angiosperms, high LMA resulted principally from larger cell sizes, greater major vein allocation, greater numbers of mesophyll cell layers and higher cell mass densities. This explicit approach enables relating leaf anatomy and composition to a wide range of processes in physiological, evolutionary, community and macroecology.

AB Biotic interactions can influence the ranges and abundances of species, but no clear guidelines exist for integrating them into correlative models of niches and distributions. Niche/distributional models characterize environmental/habitat suitability or species presence using predictor variables unaffected by (=unlinked to) the population of the focal species. Such variables (termed scenopoetic') typically have been considered to include only abiotic factors. In contrast, population-demographic approaches model the abundance of the focal species by including linked predictor variables, which frequently are biotic interactors. Nevertheless, a focal species might hold no, or negligible, population-level effects on its biotic interactors. Hence, contrary to current theory, such interactors would represent unlinked variables valid and potentially very useful for niche/distributional models. Consideration of population-level effects indicates that facilitators and affecting amensals (species that negatively affect another species but are not affected by it) constitute unlinked variables, but commensals and affected amensals do not. For competitors, mutualists, predators/prey, consumers/resources, and parasites/hosts, additional information is necessary. Specifically, available ecological/natural history information for the particular species involved (e.g. regarding specificity) and theory regarding ecological networks can allow identification of interactors that are likely to be unlinked or nearly so. Including an unlinked biotic interactor as a predictor variable in a niche/distributional model should improve predictions when the effects of the biotic interactor vary across the study region, or in another place or time period. Other relevant interactors must be taken into account by post-processing a niche/distributional model, or via population-demographic models that require abundance data over time. This framework should improve current correlative models and highlights areas requiring progress.

AB The Anthropocene Epoch is characterized by novel and increasingly complex dependencies between the environment and human civilization, with many challenges of biodiversity management emerging as wicked problems. Problems arising from the management of biological invasions can be either tame (with simple or obvious solutions) or wicked, where difficulty in appropriately defining the problem can make complete solutions impossible to find. We review four case studies that reflect the main goals in the management of biological invasions - prevention, eradication, and impact reduction - assessing the drivers and extent of wickedness in each. We find that a disconnect between the perception and reality of how wicked a problem is can profoundly influence the likelihood of successful management. For example, managing species introductions can be wicked, but shifting from species-focused to vector-focused risk management can greatly reduce the complexity, making it a tame problem. The scope and scale of the overall management goal will also dictate the wickedness of the problem and the achievability of management solutions (cf. eradication and ecosystem restoration). Finally, managing species that have both positive and negative impacts requires engagement with all stakeholders and scenario-based planning. Effective management of invasions requires either recognizing unavoidable wickedness, or circumventing it by seeking alternative management perspectives.

AB The successful launch of the 30-m Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) pushbroom sensor offers a new primary data source necessary for aboveground biomass (AGB) estimation, especially in resource-limited environments. In this work, the strength and performance of Landsat-8 OLI image derived texture metrics (i.e. texture measures and texture ratios) in estimating plantation forest species AGB was investigated. It was hypothesized that the sensor's pushbroom design, coupled with the presence of refined spectral properties, enhanced radiometric resolution (i.e. from 8 bits to 12 bits) and improved signal-to-noise ratio have the potential to provide detailed spectral information necessary for significantly strengthening AGB estimation in medium-density forest canopies. The relationship between image texture metrics and measurements of forest attributes can be used to help characterize complex forests, and enhance fine vegetation biophysical properties, a difficult challenge when using spectral vegetation indices especially in closed canopies. This study examines the prospects of using Landsat-8 OLI sensor derived texture metrics for estimating AGB for three medium-density plantation forest species in KwaZulu Natal, South Africa. In order to achieve this objective, three unique data pre-processing techniques were tested (analysis I: Landsat-8 OLI raw spectral-bands vs. raw texture bands; analysis II: Landsat-8 OLI raw spectral-band ratios vs. texture band ratios and analysis III: Landsat-8 OLI derived vegetation indices vs. texture band ratios). The landsat-8 OLI derived texture parameters were examined for robustness in estimating AGB using linear regression, stepwise-multiple linear regression and stochastic gradient boosting regression models. The results of this study demonstrated that all texture parameters particularly band texture ratios calculated using a 3 x 3 window size, could enhance AGB estimation when compared to simple spectral reflectance, simple band ratios and the most popular spectral vegetation indices. For instance, the use of combined texture ratios yielded the highest R-2 values of 0.76 (RMSE = 9.55 t ha(-1) (18.07%) and CV-RMSE of 0.18); 0.74 (RMSE = 12.81 t ha(-1) (17.72%) and CV-RMSE of 0.08); 0.74 (RMSE = 12.67 t ha(-1) (06.15%) and CV-RMSE of 0.06) and 0.53 (RMSE = 20.15 t ha(-1) (14.40%) and CV-RMSE of 0.15) overall for Eucalyptus dunii, Eucalyptus grandis, Pinus taeda individually and all species, respectively. Overall, the findings of this study provide the necessary insight and motivation to the remote sensing community, particularly in resource constrained regions, to shift towards embracing various texture metrics obtained from the readily-available and cheap multispectral Landsat-8 OLI sensor.

AB Faced with an accelerating rate of environmental change and the associated need for a more sustainable, low-input agriculture, the urgent new challenge for crop science is to find ways to introduce greater diversity to cropping systems. However, there is a dearth of generic formalism in programs seeking to diversify crops. In this opinion, we propose a new framework, derived from ecological theory, that should enable diversity targets to be incorporated into plant-breeding programs. While ecological theory provides criteria for maintaining diversity and optimizing the production of mixtures, such criteria are rarely fully realized in natural ecosystems. Conversely, crop breeding should optimize both agronomic value and the ability of plants to perform and live alongside one another. This framework represents an opportunity to develop more sustainable crops and also a radical new way to apply ecological theory to cropping systems.

AB Panama disease caused by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense infection on banana is devastating banana plantations worldwide. Biological control has been proposed to suppress Panama disease, though the stability and survival of bio-control microorganisms in field setting is largely unknown. In order to develop a bio-control strategy for this disease, 16S rRNA gene sequencing was used to assess the microbial community of a disease-suppressive soil. Bacillus was identified as the dominant bacterial group in the suppressive soil. For this reason, B. amyloliquefaciens NJN-6 isolated from the suppressive soil was selected as a potential bio-control agent. A bioorganic fertilizer (BIO), formulated by combining this isolate with compost, was applied in nursery pots to assess the bio-control of Panama disease. Results showed that BIO significantly decreased disease incidence by 68.5%, resulting in a doubled yield. Moreover, bacterial community structure was significantly correlated to disease incidence and yield and Bacillus colonization was negatively correlated with pathogen abundance and disease incidence, but positively correlated to yield. In total, the application of BIO altered the rhizo-bacterial community by establishing beneficial strains that dominated the microbial community and decreased pathogen colonization in the banana rhizosphere, which plays an important role in the management of Panama disease.

AB In tropical forests, vascular epiphyte diversity increases with tree size, which could result from an increase in area, time for colonization or an increase in microhabitat heterogeneity within-tree crowns if vascular epiphyte species are specialized to particular microhabitats within the crown. The importance of microhabitats in structuring epiphyte communities has been hypothesized for more than 120years but not yet confirmed. We tested the importance of microhabitats in structuring epiphyte communities by examining microhabitat heterogeneity and epiphyte communities within the crowns of different-sized Virola koschnyi (Myristicaceae) emergent trees in a Costa Rican tropical wet forest. We tested the degree to which epiphyte species composition was associated with environmental conditions and resources (i.e. microhabitats) using multivariate analyses and a null model that compared the observed epiphyte assemblages amongst different-sized trees and crown zones with assemblages generated randomly. This study is the first to rigorously examine the degree of microhabitat specialization in epiphyte communities. Microhabitat heterogeneity, epiphyte species richness and abundance increased with tree size. The largest trees had the highest microhabitat and epiphyte diversity and a unique inner crown microhabitat with canopy humus. The few epiphytes found on small trees were mostly bark ferns. Large trees had different epiphyte communities in different parts of the crown; the inner crown contained species not abundant in any other microhabitat (i.e. aroids, cyclanths and humus ferns), and the outer crown contained bark ferns and atmospheric bromeliads. Variation in species composition amongst tree size classes was significantly related to the mean daily maximum vapour pressure deficit and tree diameter, while variation within large tree crowns was significantly related to canopy humus cover. Microhabitat specialization of epiphyte species increased with tree size with 6% of species significantly associated with small trees and 57% significantly associated with large trees. Of the species present in large tree crowns, 23% were specialized to the unique inner crown microhabitat.Synthesis. The increase in microhabitat heterogeneity within tree crowns as trees grow contributes to changes in epiphyte community structure, which supports decades-old hypotheses of the importance of microhabitat diversity and specialization in structuring tropical epiphyte communities.

AB AimTo assess the usefulness of combining climate predictors with additional types of environmental predictors in species distribution models for range-restricted species, using common correlative species distribution modelling approaches.
   LocationFlorida, USA
   MethodsWe used five different algorithms to create distribution models for 14 vertebrate species, using seven different predictor sets: two with bioclimate predictors only, and five combination' models using bioclimate predictors plus additional' predictors from groups representing: human influence, land cover, extreme weather or noise (spatially random data).We use a linear mixed-model approach to analyse the effects of predictor set and algorithm on model accuracy, variable importance scores and spatial predictions.
   ResultsRegardless of modelling algorithm, no one predictor set produced significantly more accurate models than all others, though models including human influence predictors were the only ones with significantly higher accuracy than climate-only models. Climate predictors had consistently higher variable importance scores than additional predictors in combination models, though there was variation related to predictor type and algorithm. While spatial predictions varied moderately between predictor sets, discrepancies were significantly greater between modelling algorithms than between predictor sets. Furthermore, there were no differences in the level of agreement between binary presence-absence' maps and independent species range maps related to the predictor set used.
   Main conclusionsOur results indicate that additional predictors have relatively minor effects on the accuracy of climate-based species distribution models and minor to moderate effects on spatial predictions. We suggest that implementing species distribution models with only climate predictors may provide an effective and efficient approach for initial assessments of environmental suitability.

AB The terms "landscape" and "landscape approach" have been increasingly applied within the international environmental realm, with many international organizations and nongovernmental organizations using landscapes as an area of focus for addressing multiple objectives, usually related to both environmental and social goals. However, despite a wealth of literature on landscapes and landscape approaches, ideas relating to landscape approaches are diverse and often vague, resulting in ambiguous use of the terms. Our aim, therefore, was to examine some of the main characteristics of different landscape approaches, focusing on how these might be applied in the process of taking a landscape approach. Drawing on a review of the literature, we identify and discuss three different kinds of landscape approaches: using the landscape scale, a sectoral landscape approach, and an integrated landscape approach. Focusing on an integrated landscape approach, we examine five concepts to help characterize landscape approaches: multifunctionality, transdisciplinarity, participation, complexity, and sustainability. For each term, a continuum of application exists. To help improve and move the integrated landscape approach more toward operationalization, more focus needs to be placed on the process of taking the approach. Although the process can be implemented in a range of ways, in a more integrated approach it will require explicitly defined objectives as well as a clear understanding of what is meant by multifunctionality and sustainability. It will also require collaborative participation, transdisciplinarity/cross-sectoral approaches, managing for adaptive capacity, and applying an iterative process to address the inherent complexity within the system. Although these concepts are not new, we present continuums on which they can exist, allowing for clarification and distinctions to be made regarding what it means to take a landscape approach.

AB Pikeperch (Sander lucioperca), European catfish (Silurus glanis), burbot (Lota Iota), and common carp (Cyprinus carpio) were collected from the Danube River (Belgrade section, Serbia), and samples of liver, muscle, and gills were analyzed for Al, As, B, Ba, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hg, Li, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb, Se, Sr, and Zn using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) to highlight the importance of species and tissue selection in monitoring research, contaminant studies, and human health research. The Kruskal-Wallis test revealed significant differences between fish species in regard to metal levels in liver, muscle, and gills. The principal component analysis (PCA) indicated that the studied fish species could be grouped on the basis of the level of analyzed elements in liver and gills. The Mann-Whitney test showed two subsets (one comprising two piscivorous species, pikeperch and catfish, and the other, two polyphagous species, burbot and carp) in regard to Cr and Hg levels in liver (higher levels in piscivorous species), as well as B, Fe, and Hg in gills (B and Fe with higher levels in polyphagous and Hg in piscivorous species), and As in muscle (higher levels in polyphagous species). Carp had distinctly higher levels of Cd, Cu, and Zn in liver in comparison to other three species. None of the elements exceeded the maximum acceptable concentrations (MAC). However, since Hg levels are close to the prescribed MAC levels, the consumption of these fishes can be potentially hazardous for humans. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The ecosystem services (ES) concept is one of the main avenues for conveying society's dependence on natural ecosystems. On-ground applications of the concept are now widespread and diverse and include its use as a communication tool, for policy guidance and priority setting, and for designing economic instruments for conservation. Each application raises ethical considerations beyond traditional controversies related to the monetary valuation of nature. We review ethical considerations across major on-ground applications and group them into the following categories: anthropocentric framing, economic metaphor, monetary valuation, commodificatian, sociocultural impact, changes in motivations, and equity implications. Different applications of the ES concept raise different suites of ethical issues, and we propose methods to address the issues most relevant to each application. We conclude that the ES concept should be considered as only one among various alternative approaches to valuing nature and that reliance on economic metaphors can exclude other motivations for protecting ecosystems.

AB Recent practise has revealed that conservation interventions that seek to achieve multiple benefits generally face significant, if under-recognized trade-offs. REDD+ policies present prospective win-win solutions for climate change mitigation, rural development and biodiversity conservation. Notably, protecting, enhancing and restoring forests for their carbon sequestration services has the potential to additionally promote the conservation of imperiled tropical biodiversity. However, it has become increasingly apparent that efforts to design a REDD+ mechanism that optimizes emissions reductions and associated co-benefits face significant environmental and economic trade-offs. We provide a framework for conceptualizing the major related policy options, presenting the associated trade-offs as a continuum and as functions of two key factors: (1) geographic targeting, and (2) the selection of specific forest management activities. Our analysis highlights the challenges of assessing trade-offs using existing data and valuation schemes, and the difficulty of paying for and legislating biodiversity co-benefits and safeguards within a future REDD+ mechanism.

AB To understand the physiological basis of genetic variation and resulting quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for photosynthesis in a rice (Oryza sativa L.) introgression line population, 13 lines were studied under drought and well-watered conditions, at flowering and grain filling. Simultaneous gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence measurements were conducted at various levels of incident irradiance and ambient CO2 to estimate parameters of a model that dissects photosynthesis into stomatal conductance (g(s)), mesophyll conductance (g(m)), electron transport capacity (J(max)), and Rubisco carboxylation capacity (V-cmax). Significant genetic variation in these parameters was found, although drought and leaf age accounted for larger proportions of the total variation. Genetic variation in light-saturated photosynthesis and transpiration efficiency (TE) were mainly associated with variation in g(s) and g(m). One previously mapped major QTL of photosynthesis was associated with variation in g(s) and g(m), but also in J(max) and V-cmax at flowering. Thus, g(s) and g(m), which were demonstrated in the literature to be responsible for environmental variation in photosynthesis, were found also to be associated with genetic variation in photosynthesis. Furthermore, relationships between these parameters and leaf nitrogen or dry matter per unit area, which were previously found across environmental treatments, were shown to be valid for variation across genotypes. Finally, the extent to which photosynthesis rate and TE can be improved was evaluated. Virtual ideotypes were estimated to have 17.0% higher photosynthesis and 25.1% higher TE compared with the best genotype investigated. This analysis using introgression lines highlights possibilities of improving both photosynthesis and TE within the same genetic background.

AB Coral reefs are among the most diverse ecosystems on the planet but are declining because of human activities. Despite general recognition of the human role in the plight of coral reefs, the vast majority of research focuses on the ecological rather than the human dimensions of reef ecosystems, limiting our understanding of social relationships with these environments as well as potential solutions for reef recovery. General frameworks for social-ecological systems (SESs) have been advanced, but system-specific approaches are needed to develop a more nuanced view of human-environmental interactions for specific contexts and resource systems, and at specific scales. We synthesize existing concepts related to SESs and present a human dimensions framework that explores the linkages between social system structural traits, human activities, ecosystem services, and human well-being in coral reef SESs. Key features of the framework include social-ecological reciprocity, proximate and underlying dimensions, and the directionality of key relationships and feedback loops. Such frameworks are needed if human dimensions research is to be more fully integrated into studies of ecosystem change and the sustainability of linked SESs.

AB The concept of effective population size (N-e) is based on an elegantly simple idea which, however, rapidly becomes very complex when applied to most real-world situations. In natural populations, spatial and temporal stratifications create different classes of individuals with different vital rates, and this in turn affects (generally reduces) N-e in complex ways. I consider how these natural stratifications influence our understanding of effective size and how to estimate it, and what the consequences are for conservation and management of natural populations. Important points that emerge include the following:
   The relative influences of local vs metapopulation N-e depend on a variety of factors, including the time frame of interest.
   Levels of diversity in local populations are strongly influenced by even low levels of migration, so these measures are not reliable indicators of local N-e.
   For long-term effective size, obtaining a reliable estimate of mutation rate is the most important consideration; unless this is accomplished, estimates can be biased by orders of magnitude.
   At least some estimators of contemporary N-e appear to be robust to relatively high (approximately 10%) equilibrium levels of migration, so under many realistic scenarios they might yield reliable estimates of local N-e.
   Age structure probably has little effect on long-term estimators of N-e but can strongly influence contemporary estimates.
   More research is needed in several key areas: (i) to disentangle effects of selection and drift in metapopulations connected by intermediate levels of migration; (ii) to elucidate the relationship between N-b (effective number of breeders per year) and N-e per generation in age-structured populations; (iii) to perform rigorous sensitivity analyses of new likelihood and coalescent-based methods for estimating demographic and evolutionary histories.

AB Supportive breeding and stocking performed with non-native or domesticated fish to support sport fishery industry is a common practice throughout the world. Such practices are likely to modify the genetic integrity of natural populations depending on the extent of genetic differences between domesticated and wild fish and on the intensity of stocking. The purpose of this study is to assess the effects of variable stocking intensities on patterns of genetic diversity and population differentiation among nearly 2000 brook charr (Salvelinus fontinalis) from 24 lakes located in two wildlife reserves in Quebec, Canada. Our results indicated that the level of genetic diversity was increased in more intensively stocked lakes, mainly due to the introduction of new alleles of domestic origin. As a consequence, the population genetic structure was strongly homogenized by intense stocking. Heavily stocked lakes presented higher admixture levels and lower levels of among lakes genetic differentiation than moderately and un-stocked lakes. Moreover, the number of stocking events explained the observed pattern of population genetic structure as much as hydrographical connections among lakes in each reserve. We discuss the implications for the conservation of exploited fish populations and the management of stocking practices.

AB P>1. Water abstraction strongly affects streams in arid and semiarid ecosystems, particularly where there is a Mediterranean climate. Excessive abstraction reduces the availability of water for human uses downstream and impairs the capacity of streams to support native biota.
   2. We investigated the flow regime and related variables in six river basins of the Iberian Peninsula and show that they have been strongly altered, with declining flows (autoregressive models) and groundwater levels during the 20th century. These streams had lower flows and more frequent droughts than predicted by the official hydrological model used in this region. Three of these rivers were sometimes dry, whereas there were predicted by the model to be permanently flowing. Meanwhile, there has been no decrease in annual precipitation.
   3. We also investigated the fish assemblage of a stream in one of these river basins (Tordera) for 6 years and show that sites more affected by water abstraction display significant differences in four fish metrics (catch per unit effort, number of benthic species, number of intolerant species and proportional abundance of intolerant individuals) commonly used to assess the biotic condition of streams.
   4. We discuss the utility of these metrics in assessing impacts of water abstraction and point out the need for detailed characterisation of the natural flow regime (and hence drought events) prior to the application of biotic indices in streams severely affected by water abstraction. In particular, in cases of artificially dry streams, it is more appropriate for regulatory agencies to assign index scores that reflect biotic degradation than to assign 'missing' scores, as is presently customary in assessments of Iberian streams.

AB Since threatened species are generally incapable of surviving in their current, altered natural environments, many conservation programs require to preserve them through ex situ conservation techniques prior to their reintroduction into the wild. Captive breeding provides species with a benign and stable environment but has the side effect to induce significant evolutionary changes in ways that compromise fitness in natural environments. I developed a model integrating both demographic and genetic processes to simulate a captive-wild population system. The model was used to examine the effect of the relaxation of selection in captivity on the viability of the reintroduced population, in interaction with the reintroduction method and various species characteristics. Results indicate that the duration of the reintroduction project (i.e., time from the foundation of the captive population to the last release event) is the most important determinant of reintroduction success. Success is generally maximized for intermediate project duration allowing to release a sufficient number of individuals, while maintaining the number of generations of relaxed selection to an acceptable level. In cases where a long residence time in captivity cannot be avoided, the use of distinct, genetically independent captive breeding units allows more efficient purging of the genetic load in the reintroduced population, and substantially improves its viability. Overall, the study allows to identify situations in which the genetic cost associated with selection relaxation may overwhelm the demographic benefits of programs. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The evolution of languages provides a unique opportunity to study human population history. The origin of Semitic and the nature of dispersals by Semitic-speaking populations are of great importance to our understanding of the ancient history of the Middle East and Horn of Africa. Semitic populations are associated with the oldest written languages and urban civilizations in the region, which gave rise to some of the world's first major religious and literary traditions. In this study, we employ Bayesian computational phylogenetic techniques recently developed in evolutionary biology to analyse Semitic lexical data by modelling language evolution and explicitly testing alternative hypotheses of Semitic history. We implement a relaxed linguistic clock to date language divergences and use epigraphic evidence for the sampling dates of extinct Semitic languages to calibrate the rate of language evolution. Our statistical tests of alternative Semitic histories support an initial divergence of Akkadian fromancestral Semitic over competing hypotheses (e.g. an African origin of Semitic). We estimate an Early Bronze Age origin for Semitic approximately 5750 years ago in the Levant, and further propose that contemporary Ethiosemitic languages of Africa reflect a single introduction of early Ethiosemitic from southern Arabia approximately 2800 years ago.

AB In this study, we sought to understand how landscape structure affects roe deer movements within their home-range in a heterogeneous and fragmented agricultural system of south-western France. We analysed the movements of 20 roe deer fitted with GPS collars which recorded their locations every 2-6 h over several months (mean = 9 months). Based on empirical observations and previous studies of roe deer habitat use, we hypothesised that roe deer should avoid buildings and roads, move preferentially along valley bottoms and through the more wooded areas of the landscape. To test these hypotheses we paired each observed movement step with 10 random ones. Using conditional logistic regression, we modelled a step selection function, which represents the probability of selecting a given step as a function of these landscape variables. The selected model indicated that movements were influenced by all the tested landscape features, but not always in the predicted direction: our results suggested that roe deer tend to avoid buildings, roads, valley bottoms and possibly the more wooded areas (although the latter result should be interpreted with caution, as it may be influenced by a bias in the rate of GPS fix acquisition in woods). The distances to buildings and to roads were the most influential variables in the model, suggesting that the avoidance of potential sources of disturbance may be a key factor in determining ranging behaviour of roe deer in human dominated landscapes.

AB Retinoid X receptor (RXR) and Ultraspiracle (USP) play a central role as ubiquitous heterodimerization partners of many nuclear receptors. While it has long been accepted that a wide range of ligands can activate vertebrate/ mollusc RXRs, the existence and necessity of specific endogenous ligands activating RXR- USP in vivo is still matter of intense debate. Here we report the existence of a novel type of RXR-USP with a ligand-independent functional conformation. Our studies involved Tribolium USP (TcUSP) as representative of most arthropod RXR-USPs, with high sequence homology to vertebrate/ mollusc RXRs. The crystal structure of the ligand- binding domain of TcUSP was solved in the context of the functional heterodimer with the ecdysone receptor (EcR). While EcR exhibits a canonical ligand- bound conformation, USP adopts an original apo structure. Our functional data demonstrate that TcUSP is a constitutively silent partner of EcR, and that none of the RXR ligands can bind and activate TcUSP. These findings together with a phylogenetic analysis suggest that RXR- USPs have undergone remarkable functional shifts during evolution and give insight into receptor-ligand binding evolution and dynamics.

AB Stormwater infiltration systems are widely used to address the flow and water quality impacts of urbanization. However, their pollutant removal performance is uncertain, with respect to varying filter depth, and over time. Seven simulation experiments were conducted on a laboratory-scale gravel infiltration system to test the pollutant removal under a range of water level regimes, including both constant and variable water levels. Gravel filters were found to be very effective for removal of sediment and heavy metals under all water level regimes, even as the system clogged over time. Despite the sediment particle size distribution being much smaller than the filter media pore size, sediment and its associated pollutants were effectively trapped in the top of the gravel filter, even when the water level was allowed to vary. A media depth of 0.5 m was found to achieve adequate pollutant removal. Breakthrough of pollutants may not be of concern, since physical clogging occurred first (thus determining the lifespan of the filter media). However, gravel filters were less effective at nutrient removal, particularly for dissolved nutrients. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Despite growing interest in species' range shifts, little is known about the ecological and evolutionary factors that control geographic range boundaries. We investigated the processes that maintain the northern range limit of the mud fiddler crab ( Uca pugnax) at North Scituate, Massachusetts, USA ( 42 degrees 14' N), located similar to 60 km north of Cape Cod. Larvae from five populations in Massachusetts were reared under controlled temperatures to test whether cooler water near the edge of this species' range inhibits planktonic development. Few larvae completed development at temperatures,< 18 degrees C, a threshold that larvae would regularly encounter north of Cape Cod. Extensive salt marshes are present north of the current range boundary, and a transplant experiment using field enclosures confirmed that benthic fiddler crabs can survive severe winter conditions in this northern habitat. Taken with oceanographic data, these results suggest that the range boundary of fiddler crabs is likely maintained by the influence of cooler water temperatures on the larval phase. Analyses of mitochondrial DNA sequences from a neutral marker ( COI) indicate high gene flow among U. pugnax populations in Massachusetts with little differentiation across Cape Cod. Consistent with predictions regarding the homogenizing influence of gene flow, larvae from source populations north and south of Cape Cod shared a common lower threshold for development. However, larvae produced near the range edge had faster growth rates than those from the south side of Cape Cod ( typically reaching the final megalopal stage 1.0-5.5 d faster at 18 degrees C). Additional studies are needed to determine the mechanism underlying this counter-gradient variation in development time. We hypothesize that dispersal into cooler water on the north side of Cape Cod may act as a selection filter that sieves out slow developers from the larval pool by increasing planktonic duration and exposure to associated sources of mortality. Thus while high gene flow may prevent the evolution of greater cold tolerance in northern populations, recurrent selection on existing variation may lead to an unexpected concentration of favorable adaptations at the edge of the range. Such a pattern could permit edge populations to play a dominant and unrecognized role in future range extensions.

AB Using spatial predictions of future threats to biodiversity, we assessed for the first time the relative potential impacts of future land use and climate change on the threat status of plant species. We thus estimated how many taxa could be affected by future threats that are usually not included in current IUCN Red List assessments. Here, we computed the Red List status including future threats of 227 Proteaceae taxa endemic to the Cape Floristic Region, South Africa, and compared this with their Red List status excluding future threats. We developed eight different land use and climate change scenarios for the year 2020, providing a range of best- to worst-case scenarios. Four scenarios include only the effects of future land use change, while the other four also include the impacts of projected anthropogenic climate change (HadCM2 IS92a GGa), using niche-based models. Up to a third of the 227 Proteaceae taxa are uplisted (become more threatened) by up to three threat categories if future threats as predicted for 2020 are included, and the proportion of threatened Proteaceae taxa rises on average by 9% (range 2-16%), depending on the scenario. With increasing severity of the scenarios, the proportion of Critically Endangered taxa increases from about 1% to 7% and almost 2% of the 227 Proteaceae taxa become Extinct because of climate change. Overall, climate change has the most severe effects on the Proteaceae, but land use change also severely affects some taxa. Most of the threatened taxa occur in low-lying coastal areas, but the proportion of threatened taxa changes considerably in inland mountain areas if future threats are included. Our approach gives important insights into how, where and when future threats could affect species persistence and can in a sense be seen as a test of the value of planned interventions for conservation.

AB Because sharks possess an unusual suite of reproductive characteristics, including internal fertilization, sperm storage, relatively low fecundity, and reproductive modes that range front oviparity to viviparity, they can provide important insight into the evolution of mating systems and sexual selection. Yet, to date, few studies have characterized behavioral and genetic mating systems in natural populations of sharks or other elasmobranchs. In this study, highly polymorphic microsatellite loci were used to examine breeding biology of a large coastal shark, the lemon shark, Negaprion brevirostris, at a tropical lagoon nursery. Over six years, 910 lemon sharks were sampled and genotyped. Young were assigned into sibling groups that were then used to reconstruct genotypes of unsampled adults. We assigned 707 of 735 young sharks to one of 45 female genotypes (96.2%), and 485 (66.0%) were assigned to a male genotype. Adult female sharks consistently returned to Bimini on a biennial cycle to give birth. Over 86% of litters had multiple sires. Such high levels of polyandry raise the possibility that polyandry evolved in viviparous sharks to reduce genetic incompatibilities between mother and embryos. We did not find a relationship between relatedness of mates and the number of offspring produced, indicating that inbreeding avoidance was probably not driving pre- or postcopulatory male choice. Adult male sharks rarely sired more than one litter at Bimini and may mate over a broader geographic area.

AB The concept of critical thresholds of habitat loss has recently received considerable attention in conservation biology and landscape ecology, yet empirical examples of thresholds are scarce. Threatened species management could benefit from recognition of thresholds because conditions under which populations are at risk can be specified. In this study, 56 woodland patches in northwest Victoria were surveyed for the white-browed treecreeper Climacteris affinis, a threatened insectivorous bird of the semi-arid zone of southern Australia. Comparisons with historic records indicate the species' range is contracting in Victoria. Using logistic regression and hierarchical partitioning, two models of patch occupancy were developed. Tree species composition was an important factor in both models, confirming the treecreepers' affinity for belah Casuarina pauper and slender cypress-pine Callitris gracilis-buloke Allocasuarina luehmannii woodlands in north-west Victoria. The first model emphasized the importance of demographic isolation: probability of patch occupancy decreased with distance to the nearest occupied patch. A threshold response in demographic isolation was apparent. In agricultural landscapes, most suitable woodland patches within 3 km of an occupied patch were occupied, whereas patches beyond the threshold were vacant. The threshold distance increased to a minimum of 8 km in a matrix of native vegetation, suggesting landscape context affects the response of white-browed treecreepers to habitat fragmentation. Demographic isolation is a quasi-dependent variable and therefore a second model was developed using surrogate variables for demographic isolation. A positive relationship with the proportion of woodland cover in the landscape (100 km(2)) emerged as the pre-eminent explanatory factor. Depending on woodland quality, a threshold of patch occupancy was apparent at levels of woodland cover between 15 and 25%. However, belah and slender cypress-pine-buloke woodlands now cover only 10% of their original extent in the region. These results highlight the inter-dependence of patch isolation with the amount and quality of habitat in the landscape and the implications this has for maintaining functional connectivity. The retention (or restoration) of suitable habitat is the critical issue for conservation of the white-browed treecreeper, but in landscapes below the threshold of habitat cover, viability of local populations may be influenced by the configuration and quality of remaining habitat.

AB A balanced trophic model of a Galapagos rocky reef system was constructed using Ecopath and Ecosim. The Ecopath approach allowed characterization of food web structure through integration of disparate ecosystem information derived from many years of study of Galdpagos shallow-water rocky reefs. Ecosim and Ecospace routines enabled us to explore various hypotheses about system dynamics as well as potential solutions to conservation concerns about overfishing. A full series of functional group removal simulations resulted in estimations of interaction strengths and 'keystone' potentials for each of the 42 living functional groups in the model. Relative interaction strengths in a pristine unfished system are likely to be quite different from interaction strengths indicated by this present-day model. At present, humans extract food from very low trophic levels (mean trophic level = 2.3) in Galdpagos rocky reef systems because sea cucumbers and detritivorous mullets comprised 71 and 15%, respectively, of the total fisheries catch. Catch rates of sea cucumbers (Stichopus fuscus; referred to here as 'pepinos') are shown to be unsustainable, and the population should be declining rapidly. The exclusion of fishing from 23% of the total reef area, representing a hypothetical non-extractive zone, prevented the functional extinction of pepinos that our analysis predicted to occur with no areas protected (given 1999-2000 capture rates). Even with 23% of the hypothetical area protected, pepinos were predicted to decline overall to a stable 36% of their current estimated biomass. Pepino biomass was predicted to increase to eight times that of current levels if pepino fishing were stopped altogether. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Recent studies have expanded research on biodiversity by investigating whether the effects of diversity on ecosystem functioning hinge on the presence of symbiotic microorganisms. Cool-season grasses commonly harbour endophytic fungi that can enhance plant resistance to herbivory, drought and competition. We address whether these endosymbionts modify relationships between diversity and two ecosystem properties: productivity and invasibility. We develop a graphical model that predicts endophyte infection of a grass host will weaken correlations between diversity and ecosystem properties. We then use a long-term field experiment to test this prediction by manipulating symbiosis in tall fescue grass (Festuca arundinacea), a common and invasive species in the US. As predicted, endophyte infection reduced the strength of correlations between diversity and both primary productivity and the invasiveness of tall fescue. By altering relationships between diversity and ecosystem functioning, endophytic fungi may contribute more to the dynamics of communities than previously supposed.

AB Variation partitioning by (partial) constrained ordination is a popular method for exploratory data analysis, but applications are mostly restricted to simple ecological questions only involving two or three sets of explanatory variables, such as climate and soil, this because of the rapid increase in complexity of calculations and results with an increasing number of explanatory variable sets. The existence is demonstrated of a unique algorithm for partitioning the variation in a set of response variables on n sets of explanatory variables; it is shown how the 2n - 1 non-overlapping components of variation can be calculated. Methods for evaluation and presentation of variation partitioning results are reviewed, and a recursive algorithm is proposed for distributing the many small components of variation over simpler components. Several issues related to the use and usefulness of variation partitioning with n sets of explanatory variables are discussed with reference to a worked example.

AB In this study, we determined the complete nucleotide sequence of the mitochondrial genome of the Japanese pond frog Rana nigromaculata. The length of the sequence of the frog was 17,804 bp, though this was not absolute due to length variation caused by differing numbers of repetitive units in the control regions of individual frogs. The gene content, base composition, and codon usage of the Japanese pond frog conformed to those of typical vertebrate patterns. However, the comparison of gene organization between three amphibian species (Rana, Xenopus and caecilian) provided evidence that the gene arrangement of Rana differs by four tRNA gene positions from that of Xenopus or caecilian, a common gene arrangement in vertebrates. These gene rearrangements are presumed to have occurred by the tandem duplication of a gene region followed by multiple deletions of redundant genes. It is probable that the rearrangements start and end at tRNA genes involved in the initial production of a tandemly duplicated gene region. Putative secondary structures for the 22 tRNAs and the origin of the L-strand replication (O-L) are described. Evolutionary relationships were estimated from the concatenated sequences of the 12 proteins encoded in the H-strand of mtDNA among 37 vertebrate species. A quartet-puzzling tree showed that three amphibian species form a monophyletic clade and that the caecilian is a sister group of the monophyletic Anura.

AB Crop yields can be reduced by soil compaction due to increased resistance to root growth, and decrease in water and nutrient use efficiencies. A field experiment was conducted during 1997-1998 and 1998-1999 on a sandy clay loam (fine-loamy, mixed, hyperthermic Typic Haplargids, USDA; Luvic Yermosol, FAG) to study subsoil compaction effects on root growth, nutrient uptake and chemical composition of wheat (Triticum,l aestivum L.) and sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L. Moench). Soil compaction was artificially created once at the start of the study. The 0.00-0.15 m soil was manually removed with a spade. The exposed layer was compacted with a mechanical compactor from 1.65 Mg m(-3) (control plot) to a bulk density of 1.93 Mg m(-3) (compacted plot). The topsoil was then again replaced above the compacted subsoil and levelled. Both compacted anti control plots were heed manually and levelled. Root length density, measured at flowering stage, decreased markedly with compaction during 1997-1998 but there was little effect during 1998-1999. The reduction in nutrient uptake by wheat due to compaction of the subsoil was 12-35% for N, 17-27% for P and up to 24% for K. The reduction in nutrient uptake in sorghum due to subsoil compaction was 23% for N, 16% for P, and 12% for K. Subsoil compaction increased N content in wheat grains in 1997-1998, but there was no effect on P and K contents of grains and N and P content of wheat straw or sorghum stover During 1997-1998, K content of wheat straw was statistically higher in control treatment compared with compacted treatment. In 1998, P-content of sorghum leaves was higher in compacted treatment than uncompacted control. Root length density of wheat below 0.15 m depth was significantly reduced and was significantly and negatively correlated with soil bulk density. Therefore, appropriate measures such as periodic chiselling, controlled traffic, conservation tillage, and incorporating of crops with deep tap root system in rotation cycle is necessary to minimize the risks of subsoil compaction.

AB We compared mitochondrial DNA sequences for six species distributed across the aridlands of North America to document phylogeographic patterns acid assess levels of congruence. The Curve-billed Thrasher (Toxostoma curvirostre) and Canyon Towhee (Pipilo fuscus) show genetic divisions between the Sonoran and Chihuahuan Deserts, whereas the Cactus Wren (Campylorhynchus brunneicapillus), Black-tailed Gnatcatcher (Polioptila melanura), and Verdin (Auriparus flaviceps) do not. Most likely, species without phylogeographic structure only recently colonized their entire current range. Therefore, although these species are today part of a widespread avifauna, species' distributions were historically different from today. In Baja California, the Cactus Wren and the Verdin show phylogeographic breaks at 28 degrees -30 degreesN, consistent with a division previously described in the LeConte's Thrasher (Toxostoma lecontei) and in some members of the herpetofauna. These genetic divisions were likely caused by isolation resulting from a mid-peninsular seaway that existed one million years ago. Hence, these species appear to have been broadly sympatric for at least one million years. In contrast, the California Gnatcatcher (Polioptila californica) lacks such a phylogeographic division, and apparently only recently expanded into the northern part of its current range. Thus, not all species in Baja California have had similar histories, although further sampling might reveal a general pattern. Comparative phylogeography therefore provides an indirect method of evaluating the long-term stability of faunas via assessment of levels of phylogeographic congruence, and can show whether particular species are likely to have had a long period of co-association.

AB We examined the correlation between the variables describing a visually censused reef fish assemblage and several habitat structure descriptors (both vertical complexity and horizontal heterogeneity) in the southwest Mediterranean. We used multiple regression analyses in the framework of generalized linear models (GLM), and a redundancy analysis (RDA) evaluated through a Monte Carlo permutation test with a 1% level of significance. A significant positive relationship was observed between habitat complexity as measured by the number of rocky boulders of several sizes, the number of species . 250 m(-2) (P < 0.05) and the mean total abundance (P < 0.001). Species diversity decreases with the increment of large boulder numbers, although the correlation is weak (adj. r(2) = 0.27, P < 0.05). The canonical ordination has discerned only the effect of depth on fish species composition, unrelated to the possible influence of habitat structure. Whether the observed response of the fish assemblage to changes of habitat structure is a consequence of the lack of available space (promoting competition for space as a potential driving force for structuring Mediterranean rocky reef fish assemblages), or whether it is due to a diversification of resources following the increase of habitat complexity, cannot be decided with an observational approach such as that used here. Two immediate implications of the present study are the adequacy of estimating habitat complexity by counting size-classified rocky boulders rather than measuring rugosity (perhaps a scale-related effect), and the fact that habitat heterogeneity has no apparent influence on parameters of the fish assemblage; the latter may reflect an inadequate sampling size (50 x 5 m transects) to quantify the effect of this aspect of habitat structure on species composition. Some implications for applied issues and novel methodological approaches to the problem are suggested.

AB Using 6 years of observational and experimental data, we examined the hypothesis that water and nutrient stress increase the susceptibility of pinyon pine (Pinus edulis) to the stem- and cone-boring moth (Dioryctria albovittella). At two geographic levels, a local scale of 550 km(2) and a regional scale of 10,000 km(2), moth herbivory was strongly correlated with an edaphic stress gradient. At a local scale, from the cinder soils of Sunset Crater to nearby sandy-loam soils, nine of ten soil macro- and micronutrients, and soil water content were lowest in cinder-dominated soils. Herbivore damage was six times greater on trees growing in the most water and nutrient deficient site at Sunset Crater compared to sites with well-developed soils. Percentage silt-clay content of soil, which was highly positively correlated with soil nutrient and soil moisture at a local scale, accounted for 56% of the variation in herbivory at a regional scale among 22 sites. Within and across sites, increased stem resin flow was positively associated with reduced moth attack. On the basis of moth distribution across a stress gradient, we predicted that pinyons growing in highly stressful environments would show increased resistance to herbivores if supplemented with water and/or nutrients. We conducted a 6-year experiment at a high-stress site where individual trees received water only, fertilizer only, and water + fertilizer. Relative to control trees, stem growth and resin flow increased in all three treatments, but only significantly in the water + fertilizer treatment. Although there was no significant difference in herbivore damage among these three treatments, there was an overall reduction in herbivore damage on all treatment trees combined, compared to control trees. This experiment suggests that release from stress leads to increased resistance to insect attack and is consistent with our observational data. While other studies have predicted that short-term stress will result in herbivore outbreaks, our studies extend this prediction to chronically stressed host populations. Finally, while flush-feeders are not predicted to respond positively to stressed host plants, we found a positive association between herbivore attack and stressed pinyon populations.

AB Research on the declining stocks of North Atlantic cod Gadus morhua has focused on the survival of planktonic larvae as a predictor of recruitment to the fishery. Very little is known of the ecology of benthic young-of-year cod, although it has been suggested that abundance of demersal 0+ fish may be a better indicator of year-class strength than larval abundance. We studied settlement and growth of individual age 0+ Atlantic cod in situ, using visual census and visual length estimation. Newly settled cod were site-attached and defended territories around a shelter site. Territory size increased exponentially with fish length. Growth and territory size were also determined by size at settlement and by priority; fish that settled largest/earliest grew more quickly and held larger territories than smaller/later settlers. Population dynamics of Atlantic cod may therefore be regulated in the early juvenile stage by post-settlement competition. Size at settlement, in addition to the timing of settlement, may determine the competitive success of an individual.

AB In previous experiments, specific leaf area (SLA) was shown to be correlated with both carbon isotope discrimination (Delta) and water use efficiency in peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) suggesting that SLA can be used to screen genotypes for W. However, very little information is available on the stability of the relationship between SLA and Delta across environments. The present study was conducted to examine genotype x environment (G x E) interaction for the relationship between SLA and Delta. Four peanut genotypes (Chico, McCubbin, Shulamit, and Tifton-8) with contrasting carbon isotope discriminating characteristics were grown in the field either under adequately irrigated or rainfed conditions at two locations in Queensland, Australia. The seasonal changes in Delta and SLA were examined by sampling leaves at monthly intervals. The values of Delta and SLA were significantly influenced by the location, genotype, and irrigation treatments. Genotype x location interaction effects on the relationship between Delta and SLA were not significant. The positive relationship between SLA and Delta was maintained when data were combined over sites and treatments (r(2) = 0.87, P < 0.01) indicating stability of the relationship across environments. The SLA was negatively correlated with nitrogen content per unit leaf area (SLN) which in turn was negatively correlated with Delta. The results suggested that SLA can be used as a surrogate for Delta.

AB Variation in recruitment of larvae can be important in determining temporal and spatial variation in adult demersal fish populations. This study examines how microhabitat use by newly settled cunner Tautogolabrus adspersus (Pisces: Labridae) influences small-scale recruitment variation. The microhabitat occupied by cunner recruits was characterized by quantifying 14 attributes of the microhabitat at 2 sites in Southern Maine, USA. Attributes at randomly selected sites were also recorded. Cunner recruits were distributed nonrandomly among microhabitats within sites. Recruit presence was positively associated with the presence of macrophytes and negatively associated with microhabitats of low structural complexity. Association with specific microhabitats differed among sites; however, microhabitats available also differed among sites. While presence or absence could be predicted by attributes of microhabitats, small-scale densities of fish could not. These data suggest that microhabitat use is nonrandom, and that the distribution of microhabitat types may influence small scale spatial patterns of recruitment in this species.

AB Intraspecific genetic variability is critical for species adaptation and evolution and yet it is generally overlooked in projections of the biological consequences of climate change. We ask whether ongoing climate changes can cause the loss of important gene pools from North Atlantic relict kelp forests that persisted over glacial-interglacial cycles. We use ecological niche modelling to predict genetic diversity hotspots for eight species of large brown algae with different thermal tolerances (Arctic to warm temperate), estimated as regions of persistence throughout the Last Glacial Maximum (20,000 YBP), the warmer Mid-Holocene (6,000 YBP), and the present. Changes in the genetic diversity within ancient refugia were projected for the future (year 2100) under two contrasting climate change scenarios (RCP2.6 and RCP8.5). Models predicted distributions that matched empirical distributions in cross-validation, and identified distinct refugia at the low latitude ranges, which largely coincide among species with similar ecological niches. Transferred models into the future projected polewards expansions and substantial range losses in lower latitudes, where richer gene pools are expected (in Nova Scotia and Iberia for cold affinity species and Gibraltar, Alboran, and Morocco for warm-temperate species). These effects were projected for both scenarios but were intensified under the extreme RCP8.5 scenario, with the complete borealization (circum-Arctic colonization) of kelp forests, the redistribution of the biogeographical transitional zones of the North Atlantic, and the erosion of global gene pools across all species. As the geographic distribution of genetic variability is unknown for most marine species, our results represent a baseline for identification of locations potentially rich in unique phylogeographic lineages that are also climatic relics in threat of disappearing.

AB Predicting wildfire under future conditions is complicated by complex interrelated drivers operating across large spatial scales. Annual area burned (AAB) is a useful index of global wildfire activity. Current and antecedent seasonal climatic conditions, and the timing of snowpack melt, have been suggested as important drivers of AAB. As climate warms, seasonal climate and snowpack co-vary in intricate ways, influencing fire at continental and sub-continental scales. We used independent records of seasonal climate and snow cover duration (last date of permanent snowpack, LDPS) and cell-based Structural Equation Models (SEM) to separate direct (climatic) and indirect (snow cover) effects on relative changes in AAB under future climatic scenarios across western and boreal North America. To isolate seasonal climate variables with the greatest effect on AAB, we ran multiple regression models of log-transformed AAB on seasonal climate variables and LDPS. We used the results of multiple regressions to project future AAB using GCM ensemble climate variables and LDPS, and validated model predictions with recent AAB trends. Direct influences of spring and winter temperatures on AAB are larger and more widespread than the indirect effect mediated by changes in LDPS in most areas. Despite significant warming trends and reductions in snow cover duration, projected responses of AAB to early-mid 21 st century are heterogeneous across the continent. Changes in AAB range from strongly increasing (one order of magnitude increases in AAB) to moderately decreasing (more than halving of baseline AAB). Annual wildfire area burned in coming decades is likely to be highly geographically heterogeneous, reflecting interacting regional and seasonal climate drivers of fire occurrence and spread.

AB 1. Tropical forests play an important role in the global carbon cycle, but the drivers of net forest biomass change (i.e. net carbon sequestration) are poorly understood. Here, we evaluate how abiotic factors (soil conditions and disturbance) and biotic factors (forest structure, diversity and community trait composition) shape three important demographic processes (biomass recruitment, growth and mortality) and how these underlie net biomass change.
   2. To test this, we evaluated 9 years of biomass dynamics using 48 1-ha plots in a Bolivian tropical moist forest, and measured for the most abundant species eight functional traits that are important for plant carbon gain and loss. Demographic processes were related to the abiotic and biotic factors using structural equation models.
   3. Variation in net biomass change across plots was mostly due to stand-level mortality, but mortality itself could not be predicted at this scale. Contrary to expectations, we found that species richness and trait composition - which is an indicator for the mass-ratio theory - had little effect on the demographic processes. Biomass recruitment (i.e. the biomass growth by recruiting trees) increased with higher resource availability (i.e. water and light) and with high species richness, probably because of increased resource use efficiency. Biomass growth of larger, established trees increased with higher sand content, which may facilitate root growth of larger trees to deeper soil layers.
   4. In sum, diversity and mass-ratio are of limited importance for the productivity of this forest. Instead, in this moist tropical forest with a marked dry season, demographic processes are most strongly determined by soil texture, soil water availability and forest structure. Only by simultaneously evaluating multiple abiotic and biotic drivers of demographic processes, better insights can be gained into mechanisms playing a role in the carbon sequestration potential of tropical forests and natural systems in general.

AB Fire is an integral Earth system process, playing an important role in the distribution of terrestrial ecosystems and affecting the carbon cycle at the global scale. Fire activity is controlled by a number of biophysical factors, including climate, whose relevance varies across regions and landscapes. In light of the ongoing climate change, understanding the fire-climate relationships is an issue of current interest in order to identify the most vulnerable regions. Building upon recent global observations of burned areas and climate, we investigate the sensitivity of fire activity to fire-weather across the world's major biomes. We identify the biomes susceptible to inter-annual fire-weather fluctuations, unveiling a non-linear relationship with a saturation threshold past which the area burned can be considered insensitive to increasing fire-weather. Our results depict an unambiguous spatial pattern that identifies the world regions where short-term climate fluctuations are unlikely to produce any significant effect on current fire activity, and those most sensitive to fire-weather changes. In particular, the boreal forests and extensive areas of tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests (excluding Africa) as well as sizeable areas of temperate broadleaf forests are identified as highly sensitive. We then present near-future fire-weather scenarios (period 2026-2045) using a state-of-the-art ensemble or Earth System Models (ESMs) from the CMIP5 database, considering a moderate and a high emission scenario (RCPs 4.5 and 8.5). The projected anomalies in fire-weather for the vulnerable temperate biomes are small in magnitude and their direction is either negative or just slightly positive, although significant differences in the projected probability density functions suggest that disruptions of fire regimes may occur locally. Other sensitive ecosystems, like the rain forests of the Amazon basin may experience a significant increment in fire-weather that may result in severe impacts on fire regimes as a direct consequence of climate change in the next decades.

AB In this paper we present a review of the available Holocene pollen records from the Spanish Central System (113 sites and 150 C-14 dates). Palynological data obtained from pollen analyses of peat-bogs, lakes and archaeological sites, as well as radiocarbon dating, were used to infer the human impact on vegetation and landscape during the last 9 millennia. The Neolithic contribution to the configuration of landscape is scarce, limited to the valleys, while Chalcolithic settlements and their related activities (agriculture and grazing) represent the first evidence of significant human impact on the high-mountains. The pollen record has allowed us to relate two cultural periods of changing, the Copper Age-Early Bronze Age and Late Bronze Age-Early Iron Age transitions, to abrupt climate disruptions, the so-called 4.2 and 2.8 ka cal BP events respectively. From the Iron Age to the Early Middle Ages, anthropic activities were still sporadic, mainly located in the lowlands, but from the Feudal Period onwards, when La Mesta transhumance system takes place, high-mountain landscapes changed dramatically. Late Modern Period brings a further intensification of human pressure, especially related to forestry, with widespread pinewood afforestation. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

AB Chloroplasts are the primary energy suppliers for plants, and much of the total leaf nitrogen is distributed to these organelles. During growth and reproduction, chloroplasts in turn represent a major source of nitrogen to be recovered from senescing leaves and used in newly-forming and storage organs. Chloroplast proteins also can be an alternative substrate for respiration under suboptimal conditions. Autophagy is a process of bulk degradation and nutrient sequestration that is conserved in all eukaryotes. Autophagy can selectively target chloroplasts as whole organelles and or as Rubisco-containing bodies that are enclosed by the envelope and specifically contain the stromal portion of the chloroplast. Although information is still limited, recent work indicates that chloroplast recycling via autophagy plays important roles not only in developmental processes but also in organelle quality control and adaptation to changing environments.

AB Considerable effort has been directed into separate but related research foci the study of ecosystem services and participatory mapping methods. The two research foci intersect in the mapping of place-based values, an operational form of social values for ecosystem services that uses public participation GIS (PPGIS) methods. The social valuation of ecosystem services through participatory mapping offers an alternative valuation approach to economic valuation of ecosystem services. This study analyzes the spatial associations between global land cover which provides a proxy indicator of ecosystem services, and place-based values from 11 PPGIS studies completed in the U.S., Australia, and New Zealand that comprise a diverse set of temperate ecoregions. Key findings include: the highest frequencies of social values for ecosystem services were associated with forested land cover; water bodies were highly valuable relative to area occupied; and agricultural land and areas of permanent snow and ice were least valuable. Most land cover classes demonstrated high diversity of social values. The importance of different land cover types varies based on the selected evaluation criteria. Additional research is needed to determine whether economic and social valuation approaches provide complementary, contradictory, or redundant measures of the importance of landscapes for providing ecosystem services.

AB In this essay we explore questions on how to increase the visibility and utility of genetic information for biodiversity managers and policy makers. This is discussed in the light of Aichi CBD Target 13, which for the first time impels signatories to minimise genetic erosion and safeguard genetic diversity. Drawing on qualitative results from a questionnaire sent to European conservation professionals by the ConGRESS Framework 7 Support Action (www.congressgenetics.eu), we summarise our preliminary findings on the attitudes and experiences of European conservation professionals in using genetics. We then discuss the implications of these findings for academics involved in conservation genetics and suggest that a much closer partnership between academic conservation geneticists and conservation practitioners is necessary if the full potential of genetic tools in conservation is to be realised.

AB Aim To test the prediction that environmental suitability derived from species distribution modelling (SDM) could be a surrogate for jaguar local population density estimates. Location Americas. Methods We used 1409 occurrence records of jaguars to model the distribution of the species using 11 SDM methods. We tested whether models suitability is linearly correlated with jaguar population densities estimated from 37 different locations. We evaluated whether the relationship between density and suitability forms a constraint envelope, in which higher densities are found mainly in regions with high suitability, whereas low densities can occur in regions with variable suitability. We tested this using heteroscedasticity test and quantile regressions. Results A positive linear relationship between suitability and jaguar density was found only for four methods [bioclimatic envelope (BIOCLIM), genetic algorithm for rule set production (GARP), maximum entropy (Maxent) and generalized boosting models (GBM)], but with weak explanatory power. BIOCLIM showed the strongest relationship. Variance of suitability for lower densities values was larger than for higher values for many of the SDM models used, but the quantile regression was significantly positive only for BIOCLIM and random forests (RF). RF and GBM provided the most accurate models when measured with the standard SDM evaluation metrics, but possess poor relationship with local density estimates. Main conclusions Results indicate that the relationship between density and suitability could be better described as a triangular constraint envelope than by a straight positive relationship, and some of the SDM methods tested here were able to discriminate regions with high or low local population densities. Low jaguar densities can occur in areas with low or high suitability, whereas high values are restricted to areas where the suitability is greater. In high suitability areas but with low jaguar density estimates, we discuss how extrinsic factors driving abundance could act at local scales and then prevent higher densities that would be expected by the favourable regional environmental conditions.

   ENGLAND; CONSERVATION; EXTINCTION; WEATHER; IMPACT; INDICATORS
AB Threats to biodiversity resulting from habitat destruction and deterioration have been documented for many species, whilst climate change is regarded as increasingly impacting upon species' distribution and abundance. However, few studies have disentangled the relative importance of these two drivers in causing recent population declines. We quantify the relative importance of both processes by modelling annual variation in population growth of 18 farmland bird species in the UK as a function of measures of land-use intensity and weather. Modelled together, both had similar explanatory power in accounting for annual fluctuations in population growth. When these models were used to retrodict population trends for each species as a function of annual variation in land-use intensity and weather combined, and separately, retrodictions incorporating land-use intensity were more closely linked to observed population trends than retrodictions based only on weather, and closely matched the UK farmland bird index from 1970 onwards. Despite more stable land-use intensity in recent years, climate change (inferred from weather trends) has not overtaken land-use intensity as the dominant driver of bird populations.

AB Despite international protection of white sharks Carcharodon carcharias, important conservation parameters such as abundance, population structure and genetic diversity are largely unknown. The tissue of 97 predominately juvenile white sharks sampled from spatially distant eastern and southwestern Australian coastlines was sequenced for the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region and genotyped with 6 nuclear-encoded microsatellite loci. MtDNA population structure was found between the eastern and southwestern coasts (F-ST = 0.142, p < 0.0001), implying female reproductive philopatry. This concurs with recent satellite and acoustic tracking findings which suggest the sustained presence of discrete east coast nursery areas. Furthermore, population subdivision was found between the same regions with biparentally inherited micro satellite markers (F-ST = 0.009, p < 0.05), suggesting that males may also exhibit some degree of reproductive philopatry; 5 sharks captured along the east coast had mtDNA haplotypes that resembled western Indian Ocean sharks more closely than Australian/New Zealand sharks, suggesting that transoceanic dispersal, or migration resulting in breeding, may occur sporadically. Our most robust estimate of contemporary genetic effective population size was low and close to thresholds at which adaptive potential may be lost. For a variety of reasons, these contemporary estimates were at least 1, possibly 2, orders of magnitude below our historical effective size estimates. Population decline could expose these genetically isolated populations to detrimental genetic effects. Regional Australian white shark conservation management units should be implemented until genetic population structure, size and diversity can be investigated in more detail.

AB The arsenic (As) contamination of groundwater has increasingly been recognized as a major global issue of concern. As groundwater resources are one of most important freshwater sources for water supplies in Southeast Asian countries, it is important to investigate the spatial distribution of As contamination and evaluate the health risk of As for these countries. The detection of As contamination in groundwater resources, however, can create a substantial labor and cost burden for Southeast Asian countries. Therefore, modeling approaches for As concentration using conventional on-site measurement data can be an alternative to quantify the As contamination. The objective of this study is to evaluate the predictive performance of four different models; specifically, multiple linear regression (MLR), principal component regression (PCR), artificial neural network (ANN), and the combination of principal components and an artificial neural network (PC-ANN) in the prediction of As concentration, and to provide assessment tools for Southeast Asian countries including Cambodia, Laos, and Thailand. The modeling results show that the prediction accuracy of PC-ANN (Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficients: 0.98 (traning step) and 0.71 (validation step)) is superior among the four different models. This finding can be explained by the fact that the PC-ANN not only solves the problem of collinearity of input variables, but also reflects the presence of high variability in observed As concentrations. We expect that the model developed in this work can be used to predict As concentrations using conventional water quality data obtained from on-site measurements, and can further provide reliable and predictive information for public health management policies.

AB Climate models predict widespread shifts in precipitation patterns and increases in the frequency of extreme events such as droughts, but consequences for key processes in affected ecosystems remains poorly understood. A 2-year manipulative experiment used a series of stream mesocosms to test the effect of recurrent drought disturbance on the composition and secondary production of macroinvertebrate consumer assemblages and functional groups. On average, secondary production in drought-disturbed communities (mean 4.5 g m-2 yr-1) was less than half of that that in controls (mean 10.4 g m-2 yr-1). The effects of the drought differed among functional feeding groups, with substantial declines for detritivore shredders (by 69%) and engulfing predators (by 94%). Contrasting responses were evident among taxa within most functional feeding groups, ranging from extirpation to irruptions in the case of several small midge larvae, but production of most species was suppressed. Taxon-specific responses were related to body mass and voltinism. The ratio of production to biomass (community P/B) increased under drought, reflecting a shift in production from large long-lived taxa to smaller taxa with faster life cycles. This research provides some of the first experimental evidence of the profound effects that droughts can have on both the structure and functioning of aquatic ecosystems.

AB P>1. Mast seeding is the intermittent production of large quantities of seed across a perennial plant population. Such seeding events in many plant species are initiated by climatic cues, but whether these cues act solely as triggers or also via alterations to nutrient availability is unclear.
   2. Here, we examine the effect of nitrogenous fertilization on the relationship between seed production in Nothofagus solandri var. cliffortioides and two climatic cues (rainfall and temperature) at specific stages in reproductive development from 1999 to 2008.
   3. Foliar nitrogen concentrations were positively correlated with rainfall among years, suggesting rainfall was affecting nitrogen availability.
   4. Seedfall mass in unfertilized stands was predominantly determined by rainfall during resource priming, while seed production in fertilized stands was more affected by temperature during floral primordia development. Similarly, seedfall mass in older stands, which contain greater internal nutrient reserves, was predominantly determined by temperature.
   5. Synthesis. The results of this study demonstrate that the sensitivity of seed production to climatic cues can be altered by manipulation of resource availability and therefore establish that climatic cues involved in the synchronization of mast seeding can influence reproductive effort via an effect on resource availability. These results also indicate that alterations to resource availability have the potential to alter inter-annual patterns of seed production, but further study is required to verify this finding.

ID CONSERVATION; GENETICS; PLANTS; TURKEY
AB A species is considered to be "rare" if it exhibits any one of the following attributes: (1) naturally occurs in a narrow geographical area, (2) occupies only one or a few specialised habitats, (3) forms only small population(s) in its range. An "endemic" species, however, grows naturally in a single geographical area, the size of which could be either narrow or relatively large. Not all endemic species are rare, just as not all rare species must necessarily be endemic. Many rare and/or endemic species exhibit one or more of the following attributes which make them especially prone to extinction: (1) narrow (and single) geographical range, (2) only one or a few populations, (3) small population size and little genetic variability, (4) over-exploitation by people, (5) declining population sizes, (6) low reproductive potential, (7) the need for specialised ecological niches, (8) growth that requires stable and nearly constant environments. When habitats of a rare and/or endemic species are damaged and/or fragmented by various human activities, the distribution ranges and population sizes of the species will be reduced, leaving them vulnerable to extinction at a much higher rate than other comparable species. Species that experience any of the above attributes must be given priority and monitored and managed carefully in an effort to promote genetic conservation.

AB Four species of pelagic fish of particular management concern in the upper San Francisco Estuary, California, USA, have declined precipitously since ca. 2002: delta smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus), longfin smelt (Spirinchus thaleichthys), striped bass (Morone saxatilis), and threadfin shad (Dorosoma petenense). The estuary has been monitored since the late 1960s with extensive collection of data on the fishes, their pelagic prey, phytoplankton biomass, invasive species, and physical factors. We used multivariate autoregressive (MAR) modeling to discern the main factors responsible for the declines. An expert-elicited model was built to describe the system. Fifty-four relationships were built into the model, only one of which was of uncertain direction a priori. Twenty-eight of the proposed relationships were strongly supported by or consistent with the data, while 26 were close to zero (not supported by the data but not contrary to expectations). The position of the 2% isohaline (a measure of the physical response of the estuary to freshwater flow) and increased water clarity over the period of analyses were two factors affecting multiple declining taxa (including fishes and the fishes' main zooplankton prey). Our results were relatively robust with respect to the form of stock-recruitment model used and to inclusion of subsidiary covariates but may be enhanced by using detailed state-space models that describe more fully the life-history dynamics of the declining species.

AB The potential role of the hyporheic zone as a refugium for stream invertebrates during hydrological perturbations was acknowledged more than five decades ago. However, field evidence to support the hyporheic refuge hypothesis during periods of flow recession and severe low flow remains equivocal. Some studies report fauna using the hyporheic zone during periods of flow cessation whilst others have recorded little or no refuge use due to limited habitat availability or harsh abiotic conditions. We assessed aquatic macroinvertebrate community changes associated with severe low flow conditions during a severe supra-seasonal drought on the Little Stour River (UK). Paired benthic and hyporheic samples were collected from four sites (two perennial, two intermittent) on the upper reaches of the river. The number of benthic taxa and the proportion of benthos (particularly the amphipod Gammarus pulex) within the hyporheic zone relative to those in the benthic samples increased significantly during the latter stages of the drought at all sites. These changes coincided with elevated benthic and hyporheic water temperatures rather than a reduction in river discharge alone. The abundance of obligate hypogean macroinvertebrates also increased during the latter stages of the event, suggesting that hypogean taxa may also utilise the shallow hyporheic zone during adverse environmental conditions. Our results, based on paired surface-hyporheic field samples at multiple sites, support the hyporheic refuge hypothesis within a temperate groundwater-dominated stream during severe drought. The results also clearly demonstrate the importance of considering surface-subsurface linkages when assessing responses to disturbance in streams.

AB To determine how historical processes, namely speciation, extinction, and dispersal, have contributed to regional species diversity patterns across the marine tropics, we examined the biogeographical history of a circumtropical genus of intertidal gastropods. A species-level phylogeny of Nerita, representing approximately 87% of extant species, was developed from 1608 bp of mitochondrial (COI and 16S) and nuclear (ATPS alpha) markers. Phylogenetic relationships generally corresponded to prior classifications; however, comprehensive sampling revealed a number of previously undetected ESUs. Using the resulting tree as a framework, we combined geographical distributions and fossil evidence to reconstruct ancestral ranges, produce a time-calibrated chronogram, and estimate diversification rates. Analyses revealed two monophyletic eastern Pacific + Atlantic (EPA) clades, each of which likely split from an Indo-West Pacific (IWP) sister clade prior to an early Miocene Tethys Seaway closure. More recent diversification throughout the IWP appears to have been driven by both vicariance and dispersal events; EPA diversity has been further shaped by speciation across the Central American Seaway prior to its closure and dispersal across the Atlantic. Despite the latter, inter-regional dispersal has been rare, and likely contributes little to regional diversity patterns. Similarly, infrequent transitions into temperate regions combined with reduced diversification rates may explain low diversity in West and South Pacific clades. Since origination, Nerita diversification appears remarkably constant, with the exception of a lag in the late Eocene-early Oligocene and elevated rates in the late Oligocene-early Miocene. However, a comparison among regions suggested that IWP clades have experienced, on average, higher rates of speciation. Fossil evidence indicates that the EPA likely witnessed greater extinction relative to the IWP. We propose that regional differences in species diversity in Nerita have been largely shaped by differential rates of speciation and extinction. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Despite recent advances in conservation genetics and related disciplines and the growing impact that conservation genetics is having in conservation biology, our knowledge on several key issues in the field is still insufficient. Here we identify some of these issues together with addressing several paradoxes which have to be solved before conservation genetics can face new challenges that are appearing in the transitory phase from the population genetics into the population genomics era. Most of these issues, paradoxes and challenges, like the central dogma of conservation genetics, the computational, theoretical and laboratory experiment achievements and limitations in the conservation genetics field have been discussed. Further knowledge on the consequences of inbreeding and outbreeding depression in wild populations as well as the capacity of small populations to adapt to local environmental conditions is also urgently needed. The integration of experimental, theoretical and applied conservation genetics will contribute to improve our understanding of methodological and applied aspects of conservation genetics.

AB Before European settlement the plains bison (Bison bison bison) numbered in the tens of millions across most of the temperate region of North America. Within the span of a few decades during the mid- to late-1800s its numbers were reduced by hunting and other factors to a few hundred. The plight of the plains bison led to one of the first major movements in North America to save an endangered species. A few individuals and the American Bison Society rescued the remaining animals. Attempts to hybridize cattle and bison when bison numbers were low resulted in extensive cattle gene introgression. in bison. Today, though approximately 500,000 plains bison exist in North America, few are free of cattle gene introgression, 96% are subject to anthropogenic selection for commodity production, and only 4% are in herds managed primarily for conservation purposes. Small herd size, artificial selection, cattle-gene introgression, and other factors threaten the diversity and integrity of the bison genome. In addition, the bison is for all practical purposes ecologically extinct across its former range, with multiple consequences for grassland biodiversity. Urgent measures are needed to conserve the wild bison genome and to restore the ecological role of bison in grassland ecosystems. Socioeconomic trends in the Great Plains, combined with new information about bison conservation needs and new conservation initiatives by both the public and public sectors, have set the stage for significant progress in bison conservation over the next few years.

AB In many lakes, the most conspicuous seasonal events are the phytoplankton spring bloom and the subsequent clear-water phase, a period of low-phytoplankton biomass that is frequently caused by mesozooplankton (Daphnia) grazing. In Central European lakes, the timing of the clear-water phase is linked to large-scale climatic forcing, with warmer winters being followed by an earlier onset of the clear-water phase. Mild winters may favour an early build-up of Daphnia populations, both directly through increased surface temperatures and indirectly by reducing light limitation and enhancing algal production, all being a consequence of earlier thermal stratification. We conducted a field experiment to disentangle the separate impacts of stratification depth (affecting light supply) and temperature on the magnitude and timing of successional events in the plankton. We followed the dynamics of the phytoplankton spring bloom, the clear-water phase and the spring peak in Daphnia abundance in response to our experimental manipulations. Deeper mixing delayed the timing of all spring seasonal events and reduced the magnitudes of the phytoplankton bloom and the subsequent Daphnia peak. Colder temperatures retarded the timing of the clear-water phase and the subsequent Daphnia peak, whereas the timing of the phytoplankton peak was unrelated to temperature. Most effects of mixing depth (light) and temperature manipulations were independent, effects of mixing depth being more prevalent than effects of temperature. Because mixing depth governs both the light climate and the temperature regime in the mixed surface layer, we propose that climate-driven changes in the timing and depth of water column stratification may have far-reaching consequences for plankton dynamics and should receive increased attention.

AB Background: The mitochondrial genome of Metazoa is usually a compact molecule without introns. Exceptions to this rule have been reported only in corals and sea anemones (Cnidaria), in which group I introns have been discovered in the cox1 and nad5 genes. Here we show several lines of evidence demonstrating that introns can also be found in the mitochondria of sponges (Porifera).
   Results: A 2,349 bp fragment of the mitochondrial cox1 gene was sequenced from the sponge Tetilla sp. (Spirophorida). This fragment suggests the presence of a 1143 bp intron. Similar to all the cnidarian mitochondrial introns, the putative intron has group I intron characteristics. The intron is present in the cox1 gene and encodes a putative homing endonuclease. In order to establish the distribution of this intron in sponges, the cox1 gene was sequenced from several representatives of the demosponge diversity. The intron was found only in the sponge order Spirophorida. A phylogenetic analysis of the COI protein sequence and of the intron open reading frame suggests that the intron may have been transmitted horizontally from a fungus donor.
   Conclusion: Little is known about sponge-associated fungi, although in the last few years the latter have been frequently isolated from sponges. We suggest that the horizontal gene transfer of a mitochondrial intron was facilitated by a symbiotic relationship between fungus and sponge. Ecological relationships are known to have implications at the genomic level. Here, an ecological relationship between sponge and fungus is suggested based on the genomic analysis.

AB The widespread use of spatial planning tools in conjunction with increases in the availability of geographic information systems and associated data has led to the rapid growth in the exploration and application of species distribution models. Conservation professionals can choose from a considerable number of modelling techniques, but there has been relatively little evaluation of predictive performance, data requirements, or type of inference of these models. Empirical data for woodland caribou Rangifier tarandus caribou was used to examine four species distribution models, namely a qualitative habitat suitability index and quantitative resource selection function, Mahalanobis distance and ecological niche models. Models for three sets of independent variables were developed and then a temporally independent set of caribou locations evaluated predictive performance. The similarity of species distribution maps among the four modelling approaches was also quantified. All of the quantitative species distribution models were good predictors of the validation data set, but the spatial distribution of mapped habitats differed considerably among models. These results suggest that choice of model and variable set could influence the identification of areas for conservation emphasis. Model choice may be limited by the type of species locations or desired inference. Conservation professionals should choose a model and variable set based on the question, the ecology of the species and the availability of requisite data.

AB The phylogenetic relationship between Buthus occitanus populations across the Strait of Gibraltar was investigated using nuclear 18SATS-1 DNA sequences and mitochondrial 16S and COI DNA sequences. All analyses showed that the European samples are highly separated from North African samples, and also suggest the existence of three main groups within this species complex, i.e., an European, an Atlas ( = Moroccan samples) and a Tell-Atlas group ( = Tunisian samples). The European clade was subdivided into three distinct subclades. The application of a previous calibration of the molecular clock of another buthid species suggested that most of the detected mitochondrial DNA lineages including the European lineages are about three times older than the reopening of the Gibraltar Strait, and consequently, that other and older vicariant events are responsible for the observed phylogeographic structure of this species complex. Concerning the Moroccan samples, a discordance between nuclear and mitochondrial gene markers was observed. The 18S/ITS-1 gene tree could not resolve the phylogenctic relationships among the Moroccan B. occitanus subspecies and the closely related species B. atlantis, whereas mitochondrial genes suggested the co-existence of several old phylogenetic lineages in Morocco. We hypothesized that this difference may be explained by male-biased gene flow and gene conversion at the tandemly repeated 18S/ITS-1 gene regions. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science (USA).

AB We present empirical evidence that the direct and indirect effects of species richness on ecological processes depend on a system's disturbance regime. We manipulated the number of species of freshwater suspension feeders (net-spinning caddisflies) in laboratory stream mesocosms where communities were either subject to a periodic mortality or were left undisturbed. We hypothesized that disturbance would alter the direct effect of suspension-feeder species richness on the flux of their resource, particulate organic matter (POM), and alter the indirect effects of suspension-feeder species richness on algal productivity and biofilm respiration (via nutrient recycling). The direct effect of suspension-feeder species richness on POM flux did indeed change with disturbance regime. The flux of POM from the water column to stream bed was not influenced by species richness in the absence of disturbance, but increased as species richness was increased in disturbed streams. This apparently occurred because a high taxonomic evenness in disturbed streams minimized cut-rent "shading" (i.e., the blocking of flow from upstream to downstream neighbors) that, in turn, allowed diverse assemblages to capture a greater fraction of suspended resources. Disturbance also altered the indirect effect of suspension feeder species richness on algal productivity. In the absence of disturbance, increasing species richness led to dominance by a competitively superior suspension feeding taxon that had particularly low rates of nutrient excretion. Reduced nutrient availability, in turn, caused algal productivity to decline as a function of species richness. Periodic disturbances, however, prevented taxonomic dominance and eliminated this indirect effect of suspension feeder species richness on stream productivity. Our results suggest that disturbance can moderate relationships between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning by (1) increasing the chance that diversity generates unique system properties (i.e., "emergent" properties), or (2) suppressing the probability of ecological processes being controlled by a single taxon (i.e., the "selection-probability" effect).

AB Few studies have examined systematic relationships of right whales (Eubalaena spp.) since the original species descriptions, even though they are one of the most endangered large whales. Little morphological evidence exists to support the current species designations for Eubalaena glacialis in the northern hemisphere and E. australis in the southern hemisphere. Differences in migratory behaviour or antitropical distribution between right whales in each hemisphere are considered a barrier to gene flow and maintain the current species distinctions and geographical populations. However, these distinctions between populations have remained controversial and no study has included an analysis of all right whales from the three major ocean basins. To address issues of genetic differentiation and relationships among right whales, we have compiled a database of mitochondrial DNA control region sequences from right whales representing populations in all three ocean basins that consist of: western North Atlantic E. glacialis, multiple geographically distributed populations of E. australis and the first molecular analysis of historical and recent samples of E. glacialis from the western and eastern North Pacific Ocean. Diagnostic characters, as well as phylogenetic and phylogeographic analyses, support the possibility that three distinct maternal lineages exist in right whales, with North Pacific E. glacialis being more closely related to E. australis than to North Atlantic E. glacialis. Our genetic results provide unequivocal character support for the two usually recognized species and a third distinct genetic lineage in the North Pacific under the Phylogenetic Species Concept, as well as levels of genetic diversity among right whales world-wide.

AB Variation in the photosynthetic function of Abies amabilis foliage within a canopy was examined and related to three different precesses that affect foliage function: foliage aging, sun-shade acclimation that occurred while foliage was expanding, and reacclimation after expansion was complete. Foliage produced in the sun had higher photosynthesis at light saturation (A(max), mu mol . m(-2). s(-1)), dark respiration (mu mol . m(-2). s(-1)), nitrogen content (g . m(-2)), chlorophyll content (g . m(-2)), and chlorophyll a:b ratio, and a lower chlorophyll to nitrogen ratio (chl:N), than foliage produced in the shade. As sun foliage becomes shaded, it becomes physiologically similar to shade foliage, even though it still retains a sun morphology. Shaded sun foliage exhibited lower A(max), dark respiration, nitrogen content, and chlorophyll a:b ratio, and a higher chl:N ratio than sun foliage of the same age remaining in the open. However, shaded sun foliage had a higher chlorophyll content than sun foliage remaining in the open, even though true shade foliage had a lower chlorophyll content than sun foliage. This anomaly arises because as sun foliage becomes shaded, it retains a higher nitrogen content than shade foliage in a similar light environment, but the two forms have similar chl:N ratios. Within the canopy, most physiological indicators were more strongly correlated with the current light environment than with foliage age or leaf thickness, with the exception of chlorophyll content. A(max) decreased significantly with both decreasing current light environment of the foliage and increasing foliage age. The same trend with current light and age was found for the chlorophyll a:b ratio. Foliage nitrogen content also decreased with a decrease in current light environment, but no distinct pattern was found with foliage age. Leaf thickness was also important for predicting leaf nitrogen content: thicker leaves had more nitrogen than thinner leaves regardless of light environment or age. The chl:N ratio had a strong negative correlation with the current light environment, and, as with nitrogen content, no distinct pattern was found with foliage age. Chlorophyll content of the foliage was not well correlated with any of the three predictor variables: current light environment, foliage age or leaf thickness. On the other hand, chlorophyll content was positively correlated with the amount of nitrogen in a leaf, and once nitrogen was considered, the current Light environment was also highly significant in explaining the variation in chlorophyll content. It has been suggested that the redistribution of nitrogen both within and between leaves is a mechanism for photosynthetic acclimation to the current light environment. Within these A. amabilis canopies, both leaf nitrogen and the chl:N ratio were strongly correlated with the current light environment, but only weakly with leaf age, supporting the idea that changing light is the driving force for the redistribution of nitrogen both within and between leaves. Thus, our results support previous theories on nitrogen distribution and partitioning. However, A(max) was significantly affected by both foliage age and the current light environment, indicating that changes in light alone are not enough to explain changes in A(max) with time.

AB The genetic structure of field vole (Microtus agrestis) populations from northern Europe was examined by restriction fragment length polymorphisms of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in 150 individuals from 67 localities. A total of 83 haplotypes was observed, most of which were rare and highly localized geographically. Overall nucleotide diversity was high (1.34%),but showed a tendency to decrease with higher latitude. Two major mtDNA lineages differing by 2% in nucleotide sequence were identified. A southern mtDNA lineage was observed in field voles from Britain, Denmark and southern and central Sweden, whereas voles from Finland and northern Sweden belonged to a northern lineage. The strict phylogeographic pattern suggests that the present population genetic structure in field voles reflects glacial history: the two groups are derived from different glacial refugia, and recolonized Fennoscandia from two directions. A 150-200-km-wide secondary contact zone between the two mtDNA groups was found in northern Sweden. Distinct phylogeographic substructuring was observed within both major mtDNA groups.

AB Specific leaf area (SLA) is an important link between vegetation water and carbon cycles because it describes the allocation of leaf biomass per unit of leaf area. Several studies in many vegetation types have shown that canopy SLA is closely related to canopy leaf nitrogen (N) content and photosynthetic capacity. SLA increases as light is attenuated by leaf area down through a plant canopy. It therefore follows that across an individual biome the spatial patterns in canopy-average SLA and leaf N content should be significantly correlated with the spatial patterns in leaf area index (LAI) and canopy transmittance. In this paper, we show that the LAI across the Oregon transect is closely related to canopy-average SLA (R2 = 0.82) and leaf N content on a mass basis (R2 = 0.80). Canopy-average leaf N per unit area is highly correlated to canopy transmittance (R2 = 0.94) across the transect. At any given site, canopy-average SLA and leaf N per unit area do not vary significantly, either seasonally or between different codominant species occupying the same site. The results of this study suggest that the spatial distribution of canopy-average SLA and leaf nitrogen content (and perhaps canopy photosynthetic capacity) can be predicted across biomes from satellite estimates of LAI.

AB Active coral restoration typically involves two interventions: crossing gametes to facilitate sexual larval propagation; and fragmenting, growing, and outplanting adult colonies to enhance asexual propagation. From an evolutionary perspective, the goal of these efforts is to establish self-sustaining, sexually reproducing coral populations that have sufficient genetic and phenotypic variation to adapt to changing environments. Here, we provide concrete guidelines to help restoration practitioners meet this goal for most Caribbean species of interest. To enable the persistence of coral populations exposed to severe selection pressure from many stressors, a mixed provenance strategy is suggested: genetically unique colonies (genets) should be sourced both locally as well as from more distant, environmentally distinct sites. Sourcing three to four genets per reef along environmental gradients should be sufficient to capture a majority of intraspecies genetic diversity. It is best for practitioners to propagate genets with one or more phenotypic traits that are predicted to be valuable in the future, such as low partial mortality, high wound healing rate, high skeletal growth rate, bleaching resilience, infectious disease resilience, and high sexual reproductive output. Some effort should also be reserved for underperforming genets because colonies that grow poorly in nurseries sometimes thrive once returned to the reef and may harbor genetic variants with as yet unrecognized value. Outplants should be clustered in groups of four to six genets to enable successful fertilization upon maturation. Current evidence indicates that translocating genets among distant reefs is unlikely to be problematic from a population genetic perspective but will likely provide substantial adaptive benefits. Similarly, inbreeding depression is not a concern given that current practices only raise first-generation offspring. Thus, proceeding with the proposed management strategies even in the absence of a detailed population genetic analysis of the focal species at sites targeted for restoration is the best course of action. These basic guidelines should help maximize the adaptive potential of reef-building corals facing a rapidly changing environment.

AB A record 500,000 hectares burned in Portugal during the extreme wildfire season of 2017, with more than 120 human lives lost. Here we analyse the climatic factors responsible for the burned area (BA) from June to October series in Portugal for the period 1980-2017. Superposed onto a substantially stationary trend on BA data, strong oscillations on shorter time scales were detected. Here we show that they are significantly affected by the compound effect of summer (June-July-August) drought and high temperature conditions during the fire season. Drought conditions were calculated using the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and the Standardized Soil Moisture Index (SSI). Then the extent to which the burned area has diverged from climate-expected trends was assessed. Our results indicate that in the absence of other drivers, climate change would have led to higher BA values. In addition, the 2017 extreme fire season is well captured with the model forced with climate drivers only, suggesting that the extreme fire season of 2017 could be a prelude to future conditions and likewise events. Indeed, the expected further increase of drought and high temperature conditions in forthcoming decades, point at a potential increase of fire risk in this region. The climate-fire model developed in this study could be useful to develop more skilled seasonal predictions capable of anticipating potentially hazardous conditions.

AB Climate change is leading to shifts in species geographical distributions, but populations are also probably adapting to environmental change at different rates across their range. Owing to a lack of natural and empirical data on the influence of phenotypic adaptation on range shifts of marine species, we provide a general conceptual model for understanding population responses to climate change that incorporates plasticity and adaptation to environmental change in marine ecosystems. We use this conceptual model to help inform where within the geographical range each mechanism will probably operate most strongly and explore the supporting evidence in species. We then expand the discussion from a single-species perspective to community-level responses and use the conceptual model to visualize and guide research into the important yet poorly understood processes of plasticity and adaptation.
   This article is part of the theme issue 'The role of plasticity in phenotypic adaptation to rapid environmental change'.

AB Populations of many species are genetically adapted to local historical climate conditions. Yet most forecasts of species' distributions under climate change have ignored local adaptation (LA), which may paint a false picture of how species will respond across their geographic ranges. We review recent studies that have incorporated intraspecific variation, a potential proxy for LA, into distribution forecasts, assess their strengths and weaknesses, and make recommendations for how to improve forecasts in the face of LA. The three methods used so far (species distribution models, response functions, and mechanistic models) reflect a trade-off between data availability and the ability to rigorously demonstrate LA to climate. We identify key considerations for incorporating LA into distribution forecasts that are currently missing from many published studies, including testing the spatial scale and pattern of LA, the confounding effects of LA to nonclimatic or biotic drivers, and the need to incorporate empirically based dispersal or gene flow processes. We suggest approaches to better evaluate these aspects of LA and their effects on species-level forecasts. In particular, we highlight demographic and dynamic evolutionary models as promising approaches to better integrate LA into forecasts, and emphasize the importance of independent model validation. Finally, we urge closer examination of how LA will alter the responses of central vs. marginal populations to allow stronger generalizations about changes in distribution and abundance in the face of LA.

AB Progress in ecosystem service science has been rapid, and there is now a healthy appetite among key public and private sector decision makers for this science. However, changing policy and management is a long-term project, one that raises a number of specific practical challenges. One impediment to broad adoption of ecosystem service information is the lack of standards that define terminology, acceptable data and methods, and reporting requirements. Ecosystem service standards should be tailored to specific use contexts, such as national income and wealth accounts, corporate sustainability reporting, land-use planning, and environmental impact assessments. Many standard-setting organizations already exist, and the research community will make the most headway toward rapid uptake of ecosystem service science by working directly with these organizations. Progress has been made in aligning with existing organizations in areas such as product certification and sustainability reporting, but a major challenge remains in mainstreaming ecosystem service information into core public and private use contexts, such as agricultural and energy subsidy design, national income accounts, and corporate accounts.

AB Forest inventory attributes are an important source of information for a variety of strategic and tactical forest management purposes. However, it is not possible or feasible for field inventories to be conducted contiguously across large areas, especially at a resolution fine enough to be useful for operational management. Therefore, a large number of quantitative modeling and prediction methods have been and are being developed and applied to predict and map forest attributes, with the goal of providing an accurate, spatially continuous, and detailed information base for practitioners of forestry and ecosystem management. This article reviews the most commonly used prediction techniques in the context of a comprehensive modeling framework that includes a discussion of methods, data sources, variable selection, and model validation. The methods discussed include regression, nearest neighbor, artificial neural networks, decision trees, and ensembles such as random forest. No single technique is revealed as universally superior for predicting forest inventory attributes; the ideal approach depends on goals, available training and ancillary data, and the modeler's interest in tradeoffs between realism and statistical considerations. Useful ancillary data included in the models tend to include climate and topographic variables as well as vegetation indices derived from optical remote sensing systems such as Landsat. However, the use of airborne LiDAR in modeling of forest inventory attributes is increasing rapidly and shows promise for operational forest management applications. Different considerations are encapsulated within a generalized model development framework that provides a structure against which tradeoffs can be evaluated.

AB The quantification of aboveground biomass using remote sensing is critical for better understanding the role of forests in carbon sequestration and for informed sustainable management. Although remote sensing techniques have been proven useful in assessing forest biomass in general, more is required to investigate their capabilities in predicting intra-and-inter species biomass which are mainly characterised by non-linear relationships. In this study, we tested two machine learning algorithms, Stochastic Gradient Boosting (SGB) and Random Forest (RF) regression trees to predict intra-and-inter species biomass using high resolution RapidEye reflectance bands as well as the derived vegetation indices in a commercial plantation. The results showed that the SGB algorithm yielded the best performance for intra-and-inter species biomass prediction; using all the predictor variables as well as based on the most important selected variables. For example using the most important variables the algorithm produced an R-2 of 0.80 and RMSE of 16.93 t.ha(-1) for E. grandis; R-2 of 0.79, RMSE of 17.27 t.ha(-1) for P. taeda and R-2 of 0.61, RMSE of 43.39 t.ha(-1) for the combined species data sets. Comparatively, RF yielded plausible results only for E. dunii (R-2 of 0.79; RMSE of 7.18 t.ha(-1)). We demonstrated that although the two statistical methods were able to predict biomass accurately, RF produced weaker results as compared to SGB when applied to combined species dataset. The result underscores the relevance of stochastic models in predicting biomass drawn from different species and genera using the new generation high resolution RapidEye sensor with strategically positioned bands.

AB Trends in the start or end of growing season (SOS, EOS) of terrestrial vegetation reported previously as latitudinal averages limit the ability to investigate the effects of land cover change and species-wise conditioning on the presented vegetation phenology information. The current research provided more reliable estimates of the trends in the annual growth pattern of terrestrial vegetation occurring at latitudes greater than 45 degrees N. 25 years of satellite-derived Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (GIMMS NDVI) was used and reliable vegetated pixels were analysed to derive the SOS and EOS. The rate of change in SOS and EOS over 25 years was estimated, aggregated and scrutinised at different measurement levels: a) vegetation type, b) percentage vegetative cover, c) core area, d) percentage forest cover loss, and e) latitude zones. The research presents renewed and detailed estimates of the trends in these phenology parameters in these strata. In the >45 degrees N zone, when only reliable pixels were considered, there was an advancement of -0.58 days yr(-1) in SOS and a delay of + 0.64 days yr(-1) in EOS. For homogeneous vegetated areas (91-100% cover at 8 km spatial resolution) the 55-65 degrees N zone showed the maximum change with -1.07 days yr(-1) advancement in SOS for needle leaved deciduous vegetation, and -1.06 days yr(-1) delay in EOS for broad leaved deciduous vegetation. Overall, the increasing trend in EOS during senescence (September to November) was greater in magnitude than the decreasing trend in SOS during spring (March to May) and the change in EOS was more consistent and greater than that in SOS.

AB Masting, the highly variable and synchronous production of seeds across a population of perennial plants, is an ecologically important, but still poorly understood, phenomenon. While much is known about the fitness benefits of masting and its effects on seed consumers and trophic interactions, less is understood about the proximate mechanisms of masting. The resource budget model (RBM) posits that masting requires more resources than plants can gain in a single year. Individual plants store resources until a threshold is reached and then produce seeds, which depletes resources so that plants cannot reproduce again for 2 or more years. Individuals are synchronized by pollen coupling or environmental forcing. We review the assumptions of these models and assess the extent to which they are consistent with general patterns in plant populations. We discuss the implications of the RBM for how plants respond to changes in the external environment. Overall, the RBM is a likely cause of synchrony in many, but not all, masting species. This mechanistic hypothesis also leads to specific, but not always intuitive, expectations about how plant resources affect mast seeding.

AB Aquatic invasive species are a growing concern to environmental managers because of their diverse impacts on aquatic biodiversity and high eradication costs, necessitating effective management policies. In this study, we evaluate the ability of environmental and socio-economic factors to predict the risk of invasion in Great Britain and Ireland of 12 potential aquatic invaders covering all major aquatic groups. Despite their potential to inform risk assessments, this is the first time socio-economic factors related to propagule pressure have been specifically integrated in distribution modelling. Species distribution models (SDM, MaxEnt algorithm) were calibrated with a set of environmental factors (e.g. bioclimatic, geographical and geological) and integrated with socio-economic (e.g. human influence index, population density, closeness to ports) predictors. The inclusion of socio-economic factors in SDM did not affect accuracy scores (AUC already >0 center dot 90), but their effects were more pronounced in spatial predictions, resulting in up to a sixfold amplification of the area predicted suitable for each species. Despite the inclusion of potential surrogates of water chemistry (e.g. geology) and propagule pressure (e.g. population density), temperature-related variables were most important predictors of aquatic species' distributions. According to SDM, the environmental suitability for a suite of invaders belonging to different taxonomic groups and regions of origin is greatest in east and south-east England and decreases towards the north and west. Multiple invasions in this region are of special concern, as species are known to modify their habitat facilitating subsequent invasions, thereby potentially exacerbating their impacts. Major management regions to be prioritized in monitoring programmes include the Humber, Thames and Anglian River Basin Districts. Species of special concern include a mysid (Hemimysis anomala), a gammarid (Dikerogammarus villosus), a plant (Ludwigia grandiflora) and two crayfishes (Procambarus clarkii and P.fallax). Synthesis and Applications. The inclusion of socio-economic factors in species distribution models has the potential to improve predictions of areas under a highest risk of multiple invasions and to help disentangle the complex interplay between biological invasions and global environmental and socio-economic processes. Such understanding is pivotal to prioritize limited resources for the optimum prevention and control of biological invasions.

ID SUSTAINABILITY ASSESSMENT; INTEGRATION
AB This paper presents a critical analysis of the potential role of ecosystem services within environmental assessment, including both strategic environmental assessment (SEA) and environmental impact assessment (EIA). It identifies some of the common problems with current environmental assessment practice and then explores whether integrating ecosystem services may be able to help address some of these problems. Case studies are included to illustrate different approaches to using ecosystem services within environmental assessment and to highlight how context (e.g. sector, scale, environmental situation) will influence the most appropriate way of integrating ecosystem services into environmental assessment practice. The analysis also reflects on how ecosystem services' potential role may, or may not, differ from previous integrated approaches to environmental assessment and what lessons can be learnt from their development.
   Two main approaches are recognised from the literature and the case studies to integrating ecosystem services within environmental assessment: firstly a comprehensive approach, where the assessment framework is entirely guided by ecosystem services; and secondly a philosophical approach that applies more of a light-touch ecosystems-thinking mind-set, helping to frame the assessment methodology rather than fundamentally defining it. Inevitably, there are variations between these two extremes, and benefits and criticisms of both.
   The authors conclude that ecosystem services provides a potentially valuable framing for environmental assessment, but that it requires a pragmatic, context specific consideration of how ecosystem services can be used to help address some of the common problems with current environmental assessment practice. There is also a need to recognise that at times it may just not be appropriate if it does not provide added value. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Saprotrophic fungal community composition, determined by the outcome of competitive mycelia] interactions, is one of the many key factors affecting soil nutrient mineralisation and decomposition rates. Fungal communities are not generally predicted to be regulated by top-down factors, such as predation, but rather by bottom-up factors, including resource availability. We show that invertebrate grazers can exert selective pressures on fungal decomposer communities in soil, reversing the outcomes of competitive interactions. By feeding selectively on the cord-forming fungus Resinicium bicolor, isopods prevented the competitive exclusion of Hypholoma fasciculare and Pbanerochaete velutina in soil and wood. Nematode populations also reversed the outcomes of competitive interactions by stimulating growth of less competitive fungi. These represent two opposing mechanisms by which soil fauna may influence fungal community composition and diversity. Factors affecting soil invertebrate communities will have direct consequences for fungal-mediated nutrient cycling in woodland soils.

TI Recruitment and abundance of an invasive fish, the common carp, is

AB Although the common carp is globally distributed, it only reaches extreme densities in certain regions. We hypothesized that this phenomenon might be linked to recruitment bottlenecks which carp overcome where environmental conditions create unstable peripheral areas that it can access for spawning and nursery habitat. To test this hypothesis, the abundance, movement and reproductive success of carp was determined in two systems of inter-connected lakes in the North American Midwest whose shallow basins frequently experience winter-hypoxia ('winterkill'). Radio-tracking demonstrated that while adult carp overwinter in deep lakes that do not winterkill, they aggressively move into winterkill-prone shallow regions in the spring to spawn. The significance of this behavior was demonstrated by ageing analyses which found that carp recruit only in interconnected shallow lakes and then only in years following severe winter hypoxia. Presumably this strategy allows carp to exploit nursery habitat that is relatively free of predators. It likely evolved in response to seasonally variable conditions in the carp's native habitat in the Ponto-Caspian region. This life history may also explain the carp's abundance in other unstable regions such as southern Australia and could potentially be exploited to control this damaging invasive.

AB Litter invertebrates are notoriously patchy at small scales. Here we show that the abundance of 10 litter taxa also varies 100-fold at landscape and regional scales across 26 forest stands in Peru and Panama. We contrast three hypotheses that link gradients of abundance to ecosystem biogeochemistry. Of 14 factors considered (12 chemical elements, plus fiber and litter depth), four best predicted the abundance of litter invertebrates. In the Secondary Productivity Hypothesis, phosphorus limits abundance via the conversion of detritus to microbial biomass. Two of four microbivore taxa, collembola and isopods, increased with the percentage of P (%P) of decomposing litter. However, percentage of S (correlated with %P) best predicted the abundance of collembola, oribatids, and diplopods (r(2) = 0.38, 0.33, 0.21, respectively). In the Structural Elements Hypotheses, N and Ca limit the abundance of silk-spinning and calcareous taxa, respectively. Mesostigmatids, pseudoscorpions, and spiders, all known to make silk, each increased with percentage of N of litter (r(2) = 0.22, 0.31, 0.26, respectively). Calcareous isopods, but not diplopods, increased with percentage of Ca of litter (r(2) = 0.59). In the Ecosystem Size Hypothesis, top predators are limited by available space. The abundance of the three remaining predators, chilopods, staphylinids, and ants, increased with litter depth (r(2) = 0.31, 0.74, 0.69, respectively), and food webs from forests with deeper litter supported a higher ratio of predators to microbivores. These results suggest that biogeochemical gradients can provide a mechanism, through stoichiometry and trophic theory, shaping the geography of community structure.

AB Prediction maps produced by species distribution models (SDMs) influence decision-making in resource management or designation of land in conservation planning. Many studies have compared the prediction accuracy of different SDM modeling methods, but few have quantified the similarity among prediction maps. There has also been little systematic exploration of how the relative importance of different predictor variables varies among model types and affects map similarity. Our objective was to expand the evaluation of SDM performance for 45 plant species in southern California to better understand how map predictions vary among model types, and to explain what factors may affect spatial correspondence, including the selection and relative importance of different environmental variables. Four types of models were tested. Correlation among maps was highest between generalized linear models (GLMs) and generalized additive models (GAMs) and lowest between classification trees and GAMs or GLMs. Correlation between Random Forests (RFs) and GAMs was the same as between RFs and classification trees. Spatial correspondence among maps was influenced the most by model prediction accuracy (AUC) and species prevalence; map correspondence was highest when accuracy was high and prevalence was intermediate (average prevalence for all species was 0.124). Species functional type and the selection of climate variables also influenced map correspondence. For most (but not all) species, climate variables were more important than terrain or soil in predicting their distributions. Environmental variable selection varied according to modeling method, but the largest differences were between RFs and GLMs or GAMs. Although prediction accuracy was equal for GLMs, GAMs, and RFs, the differences in spatial predictions suggest that it may be important to evaluate the results of more than one model to estimate the range of spatial uncertainty before making planning decisions based on map outputs. This may be particularly important if models have low accuracy or if species prevalence is not intermediate.

AB Phylogenetic relationships among the Tyrannides were assessed using over 4000 base pairs of nuclear recombination activating 1 (RAG-1) and 2 (RAG-2) DNA sequence data from about 93% of all described genera, which represents the most complete assessment of relationships for this diverse New World radiation to date. With this sampling we propose a significantly expanded interpretation of higher-level relationships within the group. The Tyrannides are shown to be comprised of six major lineages, all of which represent traditional family-level taxa (sensu Fitzpatrick, 2004a and Snow, 2004a,b; del Hoyo et al., 2004): (i) manakins (Pipridae); (ii) cotingas (Cotingidae); (iii) the sharpbill (Oxyruncus) + onychorhynchine flycatchers (Onychorhynchini); (iv) tityrines (Tityridae); (v) rhynchocycline flycatchers (Rhynchocyclidae); and (vi) the tyrant flycatchers (Tyrannidae). In addition, the RAG data recovered isolated lineages with uncertain relationships, including Neopipo, Platyrinchus, Piprites, and Tachuris. The Pipridae are the sister-group to all the other Tyrannides. Within the latter, the clade ((Oxyruncidae + Tityridae) + Cotingidae) is the sister-group of the Tyrannoidea. Within the Tyrannoidea, the Rhynchocyclidae and their allies are sisters to Neopipo + Tyrannidae. Using our phylogenetic hypothesis, we propose the first comprehensive phylogenetic classification that attempts to achieve isometry between the tree and a classification scheme using subordination and phyletic sequencing. This study thus provides a phylogenetic framework for understanding the evolution of this diverse New World assemblage, and identifies many avenues for further systematic study.

AB Aim Climate changes are thought to be responsible for the retreat and eventual extinction of subtropical lauroid species that covered much of Europe and North Africa during the Palaeogene and early Neogene; little is known, however, of the spatial and temporal patterns of this demise. Herein we calibrate ecological niche models to assess the climatic requirements of Laurus L. (Lauraceae), an emblematic relic from the Tethyan subtropical flora, subsequently using these models to infer how the range dynamics of Laurus were affected by Plio-Pleistocene climate changes. We also provide predictions of likely range changes resulting from future climatic scenarios.
   Location The Mediterranean Basin and Macaronesian islands (Canaries, Madeira, Azores).
   Methods We used a maximum-entropy algorithm (Maxent) to model the relationship between climate and Laurus distribution over time. The models were fitted both to the present and to the middle Pliocene, based on fossil records. We employed climatic reconstructions for the mid-Pliocene (3 Ma), the Last Glacial Maximum (21 ka) and a CO2-doubling future scenario to project putative species distribution in each period. We validated the model projections with Laurus fossil and present occurrences.
   Results Laurus preferentially occupied warm and moist areas with low seasonality, showing a marked stasis of its climatic niche. Models fitted to Pliocene conditions successfully predicted the current species distribution. Large suitable areas existed during the Pliocene, which were strongly reduced during the Pleistocene, but humid refugia within the Mediterranean Basin and Macaronesian islands enabled long-term persistence. Future climate conditions are likely to re-open areas suitable for colonization north of the current range.
   Main conclusions The climatic requirements of Laurus remained virtually unchanged over the last 3 Myr. This marked niche conservatism imposed largely deterministic range dynamics driven by climate conditions. This species's relatively high drought tolerance might account for the survival of Laurus in continental Europe throughout the Quaternary whilst other Lauraceae became extinct. Climatic scenarios for the end of this century would favour an expansion of the species's range towards northern latitudes, while severely limiting southern populations due to increased water stress.

AB Despite some popularity of hamsters as pets and laboratory animals there is no reliable phylogeny of the subfamily Cricetinae available so far. Contradicting views exist not only about the actual number of species but also concerning the validity of several genera. We used partial DNA sequences of two mitochondrial (cytochrome b, 12S rRNA) and one partial nuclear gene (von Willebrand Factor exon 28) to provide a first gene tree of the Cricetinae based on 15 taxa comprising six genera: According to our data, Palaearctic hamsters fall into three distinct phylogenetic groups: Phodopits, Mesocricetus, and Cricetus-related species which evolved during the late Miocene about 7-12 MY ago. Surprisingly, the genus Phodopus, which was previously thought to have appeared during the Pleistocene, forms the oldest clade. The largest number of extant hamster genera is found in a group of Cricetus-related hamsters. The genus Cricetulus itself proved to be not truly monophyletic with Cricetulus migratorius appearing more closely related to Tscherskia, Cricetus, and Allocricetulus. We propose to place the species within a new monotypic genus. Molecular clock calculations are not always in line with the dating of fossil records. DNA based divergence time estimates as well as taxonomic relationships demand a reevaluation of morphological characters previously used to identify fossils and extant hamsters.

AB Individuals of 28 species of cyprinodontoid fishes have been reported from estuaries/salt marshes of the Atlantic and Gulf coasts of North America. Some species show limited latitudinal distributions and/or occupy a limited range of habitats; others are widely distributed and/or occupy a wide range of habitats.
   A literature survey was made of conditions of water temperature, dissolved-oxygen (DO) concentrations, and salinities at sites where individuals of each species had been collected, and of laboratory-determined tolerances or lethal limits and other responses to those abiotic conditions. Individuals of Cyprinodon variegatus showed the widest overall range of tolerance of environmental temperatures, -1.9-45.4 degrees C, with Gambusia rhizophorae showing the highest lower temperature-tolerance limit, 17 degrees C. The only species highly sensitive to hypoxia was Floridichthys carpio, which showed "stress" at DO levels of 6-8 mg kg(-1). All showed use of aquatic surface respiration, except for Kryptolebias marmoratus, which uses aerial respiration in the presence of H2S, and/or under hypoxic conditions. Individuals of C. variegatus were found to tolerate ambient salinities ranging from < 0.5 to 125.2, or higher, and several species of the genus Fundulus were found to tolerate concentrations ranging from < 0.5 to >= 100. However, some of the species discussed cannot tolerate salinities beyond those of dilute brackish waters. In most instances, laboratory-determined tolerance limits of temperature and salinity were wider than conditions under which individuals of these species had been found in nature. The majority of available information related to adult individuals, with few studies focused on immature stages; however, existing information permitted a brief review of spawning, incubation, and early development features in Fundulus heteroclitus.
   Suggestions were made, based on existing information, as to species that would be most likely to show altered population distributions resulting from continued global warming. These included five species that have tropical/subtropical, or subtropical/temperate distributions. Also, a few others were included that show extensive latitudinal distributions, most extending northward into cooler temperate regions of the Atlantic coast. At present, none of these species has shown a range alteration that can be attributed to global warming.

AB Females typically mate with more than one male despite the costs incurred, thus questioning Bateman's principle. A series of genetic benefits have been proposed to account for the evolution of polyandry, including the acquisition of viability genes for offspring. The 'intrinsic male quality' hypothesis suggests that polyandry increases the probability that females produce offspring sired by males that bestow high viability on their offspring. Heritable variation in viability is the basic requirement for the occurrence of this genetic benefit. By using a half-sib breeding design with a species of cricket in which polyandry is known to increase hatching success, we present clear experimental evidence that intrinsic male quality contributes to embryo viability. Despite recent support for the evolution of polyandry based on compatibility of genotypes between males and females, we show that hatching success is not determined by an interaction between paternal and maternal genotypes but rather that sons inherit paternal genes that influence the viability of eggs laid by their mates. Moreover, our data implicate a potential role for indirect genetic effects of male accessory gland products on embryo viability. Additive genetic contributions to embryo viability may be an important factor underlying the frequently observed benefits of polyandrous behaviour.

AB The internal conductance to CO2 supply from substomatal cavities to sites of carboxylation may pose a large limitation to photosynthesis, but little is known of how it is affected by nutrient supply. Knowing how internal conductance responds to nutrient supply is critical for interpreting the biochemical responses from A-C-i curves. The aim of this paper was to examine the response of g(i) and photosynthetic parameters to nutrient supply in glasshouse-grown seedlings of the evergreen perennial Eucalyptus globulus Labill. Seedlings were grown with five different nutrient treatments and g(i) was estimated from concurrent measurements of gas exchange and fluorescence. Internal conductance varied between 0.12 and 0.19 mol m(-2) s(-1) and the relative limitation of photosynthesis due to internal conductance was greater than the stomatal limitation. In most species these two limitations are rather similar, but in E. globulus stomatal limitations were abnormally low due to high stomatal conductance (0.31 to 0.39 mol m(-2) s(-1)). The large positive response of photosynthesis to nutrient supply was not matched by changes in internal conductance, and thus the relative limitation of photosynthesis due to internal conductance increased with increasing nutrient supply. Failure to account for finite internal conductance led to estimates of V-cmax that were 60% of the true value, which, in turn, led to an underestimation of in vivo Rubisco specific activity (as V-cmax/Rubisco content). The specific activity of Rubisco in E. globulus (21 mol mol(-1) s(-1)) was close to the maximum published estimates, and thus, despite these leaves containing a large fraction of N as Rubisco (38-44%) there was no evidence that Rubisco activity was down-regulated or that the enzyme was in excess.

AB Leaf nitrogen concentration (N-m), mass-to-area ratio, amount of nitrogen per unit leaf area (N-a), non-structural carbohydrate concentration (TNCa), maximal rate of carboxylation (V-cmax), light-saturated rate of photosynthetic electron transport (J(max)), dark respiration (R-d), net photosynthetic assimilation (A(net)), quantum yield of photosystem II (Phi(PSII)), and intercellular CO2 concentration (C-i) were measured in Mangifera indica L. leaves on three types of fruit-bearing branches (non-girdled, NG; girdled with high (HFL) and low (LFL) fruit load), experiencing similar light exposure. TNCa, V-cmax/N-a, J(max)/N-a, R-d/N-a, C-i, and the initial quantum yield of photosynthetic electron transport (alpha) were similar in both HFL and NG treatments, but N-m, N-a, and photosynthetic capacity parameters (V-cmax and J(max)) were lower in the HFL than in the NG treatment. The strong depressing effect of girdling on leaf nitrogen concentration cannot therefore be attributed to a change in TNCa. By contrast, N-a and TNCa were lower and higher, respectively, in the LFL than in the HFL treatment, suggesting that carbohydrate content may become the driving force behind photosynthetic acclimation to changing source-sink relationships, like the ones resulting from the presence of developing fruits. V-cmax/N-a and J(max)/N-a were lower in the LFL than in the HFL treatment, while R-d/N-a, C-i, and alpha were not affected by fruit load. It is concluded that girdling and high fruit load affect photosynthesis permanently by decreasing and increasing, respectively, leaf nitrogen concentration. Fruit load, moreover, may have an additional effect on photosynthetic capacity by affecting the relationship between V-cmax and J(max), and N-a.

AB The Iberian breed is the most important pig population of the Mediterranean type. The genetic structure of two strains (Torbiscal and Guadyerbas) and three varieties (Retinto, Entrepelado and Lampino) of this breed was studied using 173 pigs genotyped for 36 microsatellites. In addition, 40 pigs of the related Duroc breed were also analysed. In the 1960s, the Iberian breed's numbers were severely reduced by disease, due to economic change and to crossbreeding. Varieties are in danger of disappearance or blending. A new conservation strategy is required. An analysis was performed that allows us to ascertain the loss or gain of genetic diversity if one or several subpopulations are removed. The results are compared with those using the Weitzman method. The two methodologies produce conservation priorities that are completely different, the reason being that the Weitzman method does not take into account the within-population genetic diversity. We apply optimal contribution theory and a new procedure for cluster analysis, and discuss their value in the general framework of the problems of setting of priorities and tactics for the conservation of genetic resources.

AB To examine the population genetic structure of lake-resident Arctic charr, Salvelinus alpinus from northwest Europe on multiple spatial scales, 2367 individuals from 43 lakes located in three geographical regions (Iceland, the British Isles and Scandinavia) were genotyped at six microsatellite loci. On a large scale, data provided little evidence to support clustering of populations according to geographical region. Hierarchical analysis of molecular variance indicated that, although statistically significant, only 2.17% of the variance in allelic frequencies was partitioned at the among-region level. Within regions, high levels of genetic differentiation were typically found between lakes regardless of the geographical distance separating them. These results are consistent with the hypothesis of rapid postglacial recolonization of all of northwest Europe from a single charr lineage, with subsequent restriction of gene flow. On a smaller scale, there was evidence for close genetic relationships among lakes from within common drainage basins in Scotland. Thus, interlake genetic structure reflects localized patterns of recent (or contemporary) gene flow superimposed onto a larger scale structure that is largely a result of historical processes. There was also evidence for widespread genetic structuring at the within-lake level, with sympatric populations detected in 10 lakes, and multilocus heterozygote deficits found in 23 lakes. This evidence of the Wahlund effect was found in all lakes known to contain discrete phenotypic morphs, as well as many others, suggesting that morphs may often represent separate breeding populations, and also that the phenomenon of polymorphism in this species may be more widespread than is currently realized.

AB We monitored macrophyte communities (Lagarosiphon major, Elodea nuttallii, Potamogeton natans) growing in freshwater microcosms that mimicked north temperate shallow lake and pond environments. The microcosms were subjected to a 2 years simulation of two climate warming regimes (3 degreesC above ambient year-round and 3 degreesC above ambient during the summer-only), in combination with a nutrient addition (eutrophication) treatment and the presence or absence of fish. Throughout the experiment, total macrophyte abundance remained relatively high and was unaffected by warming. However, the proportion of each community made up by L. major and the growth rate of L. major increased under continuous warming. Warming did not significantly influence the abundance or growth rate of E. nuttallii. For P. natans, flowering occurred earlier in the season under continuous warming and floating leaf surface area increased under both warming treatments. The effects of nutrient addition and the presence of fish were almost exclusively warming-independent and, where of statistical significance, tended to increase and decrease macrophyte abundance, respectively. Only the growth rate of E. nuttalld was significantly increased by nutrient addition. Our observations suggest that, as a functional component of north temperate shallow lake and pond ecosystems, elodeid macrophyte communities may be broadly resilient to the small increases in temperature associated with climate warming, even when these temperature increases occur in combination with increased nutrient loading and the presence of fish. Nevertheless, it may be of some concern that the species apparently most favoured by warming in our microcosms, L. major, is an exotic which has the known potential to become problematic as a weed in temperate waters.

AB Deleterious alleles may be removed (purged) by natural selection in populations undergoing inbreeding. However, there is controversy regarding the effectiveness of purging in reducing the extinction risk due to inbreeding, particularly in conservation contexts. We evaluated the effects of purging on the extinction risk due to inbreeding in Drosophila melanogaster using two base populations, an outbred population (non-purged) and four-way crosses between highly inbred lines derived from the same population (purged). The inbred lines used in the four-way crosses were previously subjected to 20 generations of full-sib mating. The impact of full-sib inbreeding over a further 12 generations was compared in 200 populations from each of the two base populations. There was a small and non-significant difference between the extinction rates at an inbreeding coefficient of 0.93 in the non-purged (0.74 +/- 0.03) and purged (0.69 +/- 0.03) treatments. This is consistent with other evidence indicating that the effects of purging are often small. Purging using rapid inbreeding in very small populations cannot be relied upon to eliminate the deleterious effects of inbreeding.

AB An accurate estimate of the extent of recombination is important whenever phylogenetic methods are applied to potentially recombining nucleotide sequences. Here, data sets from viruses, bacteria, and mitochondria were examined for deviations from clonality using a new approach for detecting and measuring recombination. The apparent rate heterogeneity (ARH) among sites in a sequence alignment can be inflated as an artifact of recombination. However, the composition of polymorphic sites will differ in a data set with recombination-generated ARH versus a clonal data set that exhibits the equivalent degree of rate heterogeneity. This is because recombinant data sets, encompassing regions of conflicting phylogenetic history, tend to yield "starlike" trees that are superficially similar to those inferred from clonal data sets with weak phylogenetic signal throughout. Specifically, a recombinant data set will be unexpectedly rich in conflicting phylogenetic information compared with clonally generated data sets supporting the same tree shape. Its value of q-defined as the proportion of two-state parsimony-informative sites to all polymorphic sites-will be greater than that expected for nonrecombinant data. The method proposed here, the informative-sites test, compares the value of q against a null distribution of values found using Monte Carlo-simulated data evolved under the null hypothesis of clonality. A significant excess of q indicates that the assumption of clonality is not valid and hence that the ARH in the data is at least partly an artifact of recombination. Investigations of the procedure using simulated sequences indicated that it can successfully detect and measure recombination and that it is unlikely to produce "false positives." Simulations also showed that for recombinant data, naive use of maximum-likelihood models incorporating rate heterogeneity can lead to overestimation of the time to the most recent common ancestor. Application of the test to real data revealed for the first time that populations of viruses, like those of bacteria, can be brought close to complete linkage equilibrium by pervasive recombination. On the other hand, the test did not reject the hypothesis of clonality when applied to a data set from the coding region of human mitochondrial DNA, despite its high level of ARH and homoplasy.

AB A pot experiment was conducted to test the effect of three microbial regimes on the time course of heavy metal uptake in clover and maize from an industrially polluted soil. The three treatments included: (1) an intact flora of bacteria and fungi, including indigenous arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi together with soil microfauna; (2) the indigenous bacterial/fungal flora except AM fungi, reintroduced into sterilized soil; or (3) the same bacterial/fungal flora plus an AM fungus. For the final harvest, two pot sizes were included to assess the effect of root density. Plant uptake of P and heavy metals varied according to plant species, harvest time and soil treatment. For both plant species, shoot concentration of Zn, Cd and Cu decreased and Ni increased with plant age. Plants growing in sterilized soil with reintroduced AM fungi generally grew better, but contained higher concentrations of heavy metals than those colonized by indigenous AM fungi. Plants with mycorrhiza frequently contained more P, Zn, Cd, Cu and Pb in roots and shoots compared to nonmycorrhizal plants. Elevated root/shoot concentration ratios of P and metals indicate a sequestration of metal phosphates in mycorrhizal roots. Mycorrhizal performance was influenced by root density. At low root densities, metal concentrations in mycorrhizal plants were reduced, whereas it had no effect at high root densities when the entire soil volume was efficiently exploited by roots. We conclude that root density data are essential for interpretations of the influence of AM on metal uptake in plants.

AB Three-year-old Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) seedlings were grown for two years in the ground in open-top chambers supplied with either an ambient or elevated (ambient + 400 mu mol mol(-1)) CO2 concentration. Phenological observations and measurements of height and stem diameter growth, absolute and relative growth rates, starch and soluble carbohydrate concentrations of the needles, and crown structure and needle properties were made at frequent intervals throughout the two growing seasons. Elevated CO2 significantly advanced the date of bud burst in both years. The increase in total needle area in response to elevated CO2 was accounted for by longer shoots and an increase in individual needle area in the first year, and by an increase in the number and length of shoots in the second year. Stem diameter and tree height were enhanced more by the elevated CO2 treatment in the first year than in the second, indicating a decreased effect of CO2 on growth over time. This was confirmed by a study of absolute and relative growth rates of leader shoots. During the first growing season of CO2 enrichment, mean weekly relative growth rates over the growing season (RGR(m)) were significantly enhanced. During the second year, RGR(m) in ambient CO2 closely matched that in elevated CO2.

AB A method for quantifying food limitation of arthropod predators in the field is presented and applied to species of ground beetles (Carabidae) and sheet-web spiders (Linyphiidae) from a cereal field. Food limitation is expressed quantitatively as accumulated hunger (=starvation) by transforming 24-h food consumption at 20 degrees C of animals newly collected in the field into days of starvation at 20 degrees C. This is done by means of a reference curve relating 24-h food intake at 20 degrees C to starvation periods (days) at 20 degrees C. Such a reference curve was obtained for the carabid beetle Agonum dorsale in the laboratory. For other species the reference curve was modified with species-specific data. The procedure makes it possible to compare the feeding conditions of different species populations that are part of the same community. Hunger levels in the field for females of A. dorsale were equivalent to c. 15 days of starvation in early spring, c. 5 days in June, increasing to c. 10 days in late summer. Two ground beetles occurring during summer also showed increasing hunger levels from June to July, probably the result of a dry summer. Two spider species experienced a hunger level in the range of 4-8 days of starvation.

AB The combination of cropping rotation and tillaging for several years have altered the distribution of nutrients such as phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) in the soil profile. These long-term changes have led researchers to investigate the distribution of nutrients and the distribution of roots in alternate cropping and tillage systems. The purpose of this study was to clarify if and how interactions between tillage systems and crop rotation, in long-term plots, affected P and K distribution and root development, in the soil profile. This continuous long-term tillage study consisted of 8 treatments arranged in a randomized split-plot design and replicated three times. It consisted of one rotation treatment, corn (Zea mays L.) And soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] and of continuous corn as the main plot. Three primary tillage operations (fall moldboard plow, fall chisel, and no tillage) were tested as subplot. We found a greater concentration of P in the upper layers of the soil regardless of the tillage system. The P stratification was characterized in no-till system as a result of a surface applied fertilizer without incorporation. Potassium concentration in the soil surface decreased in depth in the chisel and in the no-till treatments, presumably as a consequence of the fertilization. Phosphorus stratification stimulated root growth in conservation systems when compared to the conventional one.

AB Photosynthesis of leaves is commonly observed to have a saturating response to increases in their nitrogen (N) content, while the response of plant maintenance respiration is more nearly linear over the normal range of tissue N contents. Hence, for a given amount of foliage, net primary productivity (NPP) may have a maximum value with respect to variations in plant N content. Using a simple analytically-solvable model of NPP, this idea is formulated and its broad implications for plant growth are explored at the scale of a closed stand of vegetation. The maximum-NPP hypothesis implies that NPP is proportional to intercepted radiation, as commonly observed. The light utilization coefficient (epsilon), defined as the slope of this relationship, is predicted to be
   epsilon = alpha Y-g(1 - lambda)(2),
   where alpha is the quantum yield, Y-g is the biosynthetic efficiency, and lambda is a dimensionless combination of physiological and environmental parameters of the model. The maximum-NPP hypothesis is also consistent with observations that whole-plant respiration (R) is an approximately constant proportion of gross canopy photosynthesis (A(c)), and predicts their ratio to be
   R:A(c) = 1 - Y-g(1 - lambda).
   Using realistic parameter values, predicted values for epsilon and R:A(c) are typical of C-3 plants, epsilon is predicted to be independent of plant N supply, consistent with observations that long-term growth responses to N fertilization are dominated by increased light interception associated with increased growth allocation to leaf area. Observed acclimated responses of plants to atmospheric [CO2], light and temperature are interpreted in terms of the model. (C) 1996 Annals of Botany Company

AB In Guyana dense rainforest occurs on intensely weathered acid soils, low in soil phosphorus. To investigate whether low P availability limits photosynthesis of trees growing on these soils more than N does, leaf P and N content, and their relationship with the photosynthetic capacity (A(sat) mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1)) were studied for nine pioneer and climax tree species in a range of light climates. Light environment was described using hemispherical photographs. For both pioneer and climax species, leaf P content (r(2) = 0.71 and 0.23, respectively) is a more important determinant of A(sat) than leaf N content (r(2) = 0.54 and 0.12, respectively). Pioneer species have a higher leaf P and N content than climax species. At similar P or N content, pioneers have a higher A(sat) than climax species. The saplings studied had a relatively high A(sat), considering their low P concentration (15-30 mu mol P g(-1)). All species studied had a constant leaf P and N concentration and photosynthetic capacity across light climates, because specific leaf mass (g m(-2)) increased similarly with light availability. This acclimation to a change in light environment makes a possible limitation of A(sat) by P or N independent of light environment.

Predictions of tree mortality remain limited, in large part because within-species variations in ecophysiology due to plasticity or adaptation and ecosystem adjustments could buffer mortality in dry locations. Here, we conduct a meta-analysis of 50 studies spanning >100 woody plant species globally to quantify how populations within species vary in vulnerability to drought mortality and whether functional traits or climate mediate mortality patterns. We find that mortality predominantly occurs in drier populations and this pattern is more pronounced in species with xylem that can tolerate highly negative water potentials, typically considered to be an adaptive trait for dry regions, and species that experience higher variability in water stress. Our results indicate that climate stress has exceeded physiological and ecosystem-level tolerance or compensating mechanisms by triggering extensive mortality at dry range edges and provides a foundation for future mortality projections in empirical distribution and mechanistic vegetation models.

AB Earth system models (ESMs) use photosynthetic capacity, indexed by the maximum Rubisco carboxylation rate (V-cmax), to simulate carbon assimilation and typically rely on empirical estimates, including an assumed dependence on leaf nitrogen determined from soil fertility. In contrast, new theory, based on biochemical coordination and co-optimization of carboxylation and water costs for photosynthesis, suggests that optimal V-cmax can be predicted from climate alone, irrespective of soil fertility. Here, we develop this theory and find it captures 64% of observed variability in a global, field-measured V-cmax dataset for C-3 plants. Soil fertility indices explained substantially less variation (32%). These results indicate that environmentally regulated biophysical constraints and light availability are the first-order drivers of global photosynthetic capacity. Through acclimation and adaptation, plants efficiently utilize resources at the leaf level, thus maximizing potential resource use for growth and reproduction. Our theory offers a robust strategy for dynamically predicting photosynthetic capacity in ESMs.

AB 1. Plant phenotypic diversity is shaped by the interplay of trade-offs and constraints in evolution. Closely integrated groups of traits (i.e. trait dimensions) are used to classify plant phenotypic diversity into plant strategies, but we do not know the degree of interdependence among trait dimensions. To assess how selection has shaped the phenotypic space, we examine whether trait dimensions are independent.
   2. We gathered data on saplings of 24 locally coexisting tree species in a temperate forest, and examined the correlation structure of 20 leaf, branch, stem and root traits. These traits fall into three well-established trait dimensions (the leaf economic spectrum, the wood spectrum and Corner's Rules) that characterize vital plant functions: resource acquisition, sap transport, mechanical support and canopy architecture. Using ordinations, network analyses and Mantel tests, we tested whether the sapling phenotype of these tree species is organized along independent trait dimensions.
   3. Across species, the sapling phenotype is not structured into clear trait dimensions. The trait relationships defining trait dimensions are either weak or absent and do not dominate the correlation structure of the sapling phenotype as a whole. Instead traits from the three commonly recognized trait dimensions are organized into an integrated trait network. The effect of phylogeny on trait correlations is minimal.
   4. Our results indicate that trait dimensions apparent in broad-based interspecific surveys do not hold up among locally coexisting species. Furthermore, architectural traits appear central to the phenotypic network, suggesting a pivotal role for branching architecture in linking resource acquisition, mechanical support and hydraulic functions.
   5. Synthesis. Our study indicates that local and global patterns of phenotypic integration differ and calls into question the use of trait dimensions at local scales. We propose that a network approach to assessing plant function more effectively reflects the multiple trade-offs and constraints shaping the phenotype in locally co-occurring species.

AB Spatial heterogeneity has myriad influences on ecosystem processes, ecosystem services, and thus the sustainability of urban areas. It acts as a medium for urban design, planning, and management to determine how processes affecting sustainability can operate and interact. Therefore, how spatial heterogeneity is conceptualized and measured in cities is crucial for enhancing sustainability.
   We show that the two most commonly used, but contrasting paradigms of urban ecology, ecology IN versus ecology OF the city, determine how spatial heterogeneity is thought of and used in different ways. We identify the key implications of these theoretical contrasts for the practice and assessment of sustainability in urban areas.
   We review and compare the different ways in which ecology IN versus ecology OF the city affect how to conceptualize, model and map urban spatial heterogeneity. We present a new framework to guide the comparison of spatial heterogeneity under the two paradigms.
   The integrative nature of this new framework becomes apparent under the ecology OF the city paradigm, because it recognizes the hybrid social and bioecological nature of heterogeneity in urban ecosystems. The hybrid approach to patchiness resonates with the three pillars of sustainability-environment, society, and economy. We exemplify how the more comprehensive and integrated framework of spatial heterogeneity under the ecology OF the city paradigm (1) supports more effective measurement and integration of the three components of sustainability, (2) improves management of heterogeneous urban ecosystems, and (3) satisfies calls for improved ecological tools to support urban ecosystem design.

AB Quantifying and understanding the main drivers of biodiversity responses to human disturbances at multiple scales is key to foster effective conservation plans and management systems. Here we report on a detailed regional assessment of the response of ant communities to land-use change and forest disturbance in the Brazilian Amazon. We aimed to explore the effects of land-use intensification at both site and landscape scales, examining variation in ant species richness and composition, and asking which set of environmental variables best predict observed patterns of diversity. We sampled 192 sites distributed across 18 landscapes (each 50 km(2)) in Paragominas, eastern Brazilian Amazon, covering ca. 20,000 km(2). We sampled from undisturbed primary forest through varyingly disturbed primary forests, secondary forests, pastures and mechanised agriculture, following a gradient of decreasing total aboveground biomass. Irrespective of forest disturbance class, ant species richness was almost twice as high in forests when compared to production areas. In contrast, ant species composition showed continuous variation from primary forest to intensive agriculture, following a gradient of aboveground biomass. Ant species richness at all spatial scales increased with primary forest cover in the surrounding landscapes. We highlight the limited value of species richness as an indicator of changes in habitat quality, reinforcing calls to consider species composition in assessments of forest disturbance. Taken together, our results reveal the unique biodiversity value of undisturbed primary forests, but also show that disturbed primary forests and secondary forests have high conservation value, and thus play an important role in regional conservation planning.

AB Driven by unprecedented economic development for more than three decades, China's urbanization level rose from 17.9% in 1978 to 54.8% in 2014. This breakneck speed of urbanization has resulted in myriad environmental problems and social inequities. To gauge the urban sustainability of China, our study focused on ten megacities which are socioeconomic centers of the country. We evaluated the three dimensions of sustainability using a set of sustainability indicators, including Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI), Ecological Footprint (EF), Biocapacity, Environmental Performance Index (EPI), City Development Index (CDI), Human Development Index (HDI), Gini coefficient, and Urban-rural income ratio. Based on time-series data from 1978 to 2012, our study has produced the following findings: (1) The values of GPI for the ten megacities started to increase since 2006 after a relatively constant period between 1994 and 2005; (2) The pressures of economic growth on the environment (EF) increased while biocapacity decreased for the ten megacities, with smaller biocapacity deficits for western cities; (3) The overall level of human wellbeing (HDI) increased; (4) Socioeconomic inequality (Gini and urban-rural income ratio) widened, but the widening trend seemed to have ceased in recent years for most of the ten megacities; and (5) Certain aspects of urban environment and city development (EPI and CDI) improved gradually, particularly in waste treatment and infrastructure development. Our findings suggest that, to achieve overall urban sustainability, China must move away from maximizing economic development and focus on improving environmental quality of its megacities.

The heavy metal pollution sources were quantitatively assessed, and the results illustrated the suitability of the ensemble models for the assessment of multi-source and multi-phase heavy metal pollution in agricultural soils on the local scale. The results of SGB and RF consistently demonstrated that anthropogenic sources contributed the most to the concentrations of Pb and Cd in agricultural soils in the study region and that SGB performed better than RF.

AB Proteaceae in southwestern Australia have evolved on some of the most phosphorus-impoverished soils in the world. They exhibit a range of traits that allow them to both acquire and utilize phosphorus highly efficiently. This is in stark contrast with many model plants such as Arabidopsis thaliana and crop species, which evolved on soils where nitrogen is the major limiting nutrient. When exposed to low phosphorus availability, these plants typically exhibit phosphorus-starvation responses, whereas Proteaceae do not. This Review explores the traits that account for the very high efficiency of acquisition and use of phosphorus in Proteaceae, and explores which of these traits are promising for improving the phosphorus efficiency of crop plants.

AB Marine benthic ecosystems are difficult to monitor and assess, which is in contrast to modern ecosystem-based management requiring detailed information at all important ecological and anthropogenic impact levels. Ecosystem management needs to ensure a sustainable exploitation of marine resources as well as the protection of sensitive habitats, taking account of potential multiple-use conflicts and impacts over large spatial scales. The urgent need for large-scale spatial data on benthic species and communities resulted in an increasing application of distribution modelling (DM). The use of DM techniques enables to employ full spatial coverage data of environmental variables to predict benthic spatial distribution patterns. Especially, statistical DMs have opened new possibilities for ecosystem management applications, since they are straightforward and the outputs are easy to interpret and communicate. Mechanistic modelling techniques, targeting the fundamental niche of species, and Bayesian belief networks are the most promising to further improve DM performance in the marine realm. There are many actual and potential management applications of DMs in the marine benthic environment, these are (i) early warning systems for species invasion and pest control, (ii) to assess distribution probabilities of species to be protected, (iii) uses in monitoring design and spatial management frameworks (e.g. MPA designations), and (iv) establishing long-term ecosystem management measures (accounting for future climate-driven changes in the ecosystem). It is important to acknowledge also the limitations associated with DM applications in a marine management context as well as considering new areas for future DM developments. The knowledge of explanatory variables, for example, setting the basis for DM, will continue to be further developed: this includes both the abiotic (natural and anthropogenic) and the more pressing biotic (e.g. species interactions) aspects of the ecosystem. While the response variables on the other hand are often focused on species presence and some work undertaken on species abundances, it is equally important to consider, e.g. biological traits or benthic ecosystem functions in DM applications. Tools such as DMs are suitable to forecast the possible effects of climate change on benthic species distribution patterns and hence could help to steer present-day ecosystem management.

AB There is a growing demand for incorporating social preferences in ecosystem service assessments. To establish sustainable rural landscape management with alternative sources of preferable ecosystem services that fulfills conservation objectives and reduces poverty, we need information about the perceptions of local people regarding particular landscape elements as the sources. Within a forest to agricultural landscape in West Java, we examined what types of ecosystem services were perceived by rural people, the effects of socioeconomic factors on people's perceptions of ecosystem services, and which landscape elements were perceived as the sources. We found rural people were greatly aware of ecosystem services, although more provisioning services were perceived than other services. Place of origin, residential location, area of agricultural lands and agrolorests, and number of livestock were the most influential socioeconomic factors determining the number of ecosystem services an individual respondent perceived. People living closer to the remnant forest perceived more ecosystem services. Agroforest was perceived as the source providing the most ecosystem services followed by the forest. Our findings suggest people living close to forest will promote prospective ecosystem services as long as their needs are accommodated. Furthermore, our findings indicate agroforests play an important role as a supplement of forests. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Many of the world's most vulnerable and rapidly changing ecosystems are also among the most data-poor, leading to an increased interest in use of local ecological knowledge (LEK) to document long-term environmental change. The integration of multiple knowledge sources for assessing species abundance and distribution has gained traction over the past decade as a growing number of case studies show concordance between LEK and scientific data. This study advances the use of quantitative approaches for synthesizing LEK by presenting a novel application of bootstrapping and statistical modeling to evaluate variance in ecological observations of fisheries practitioners. We developed an historical record of abundance for 22 marine species in Puget Sound, Washington (USA), using LEK, and we quantified variation in perceptions of abundance trends among fishers, divers, and researchers. These individuals differed in aspects of their information environments, which are characterized by how, when, and where an individual has acquired ecological information. Abundance trends derived from interviews suggest that populations of long-lived rockfishes (Sebastes spp.) have been in decline since at least the 1960s and that three rockfishes protected under the Endangered Species Act were perceived as relatively less abundant than other species. Differences in perception of rockfish abundance trends among age groups were consistent with our hypothesis that the reported magnitude of decline in abundance would increase with age, with younger respondents more likely to report high abundance than older individuals across all periods. Temporal patterns in the mean and variance of reported rockfish abundance indices were qualitatively similar between fishers and researchers; however, fishers reported higher indices of abundance than researchers for all but one rockfish species. The two respondent groups reported similar changes in rockfish abundance from the 1940s to 2000s, except for two recreationally valuable species that fishers perceived as having undergone greater declines than perceived by researchers. When aggregated at appropriate spatial-temporal scales and in a culturally appropriate manner, observations of resource users are a valuable source of ecological information. Continued development of creative analytical tools for synthesizing multiple knowledge sources will be essential for advancing the formal use of LEK in assessments of marine species.

AB The ways people relate to their environment are recognized as relevant to landscape sustainability efforts and policies. Contemporary human-nature relationship concepts have historical and philosophical roots and frame empirical explorations. An increasingly dominant paradigm guiding landscape assessment and management is the notion of ecosystem services, describing benefits humans obtain from ecosystems. This paper reviews literature in multiple languages (English, German, and Japanese) on empirically grounded types of human-nature relationships. The dominant dimensions used to differentiate various types are highlighted, particularly those related to positionality of humans and nature with respect to each other, character of the bond between humans and nature, and perspectives on understanding of nature. Empirical explorations of human-nature relationships follow both deductive and inductive reasoning, use both quantitative and qualitative methods, and reveal wide variation in typologies. Ecosystem services as a theoretical concept is linked to dimensions of empirically grounded human-nature relationships concepts. The ecosystem services concept is situated quite clearly in the nexus of anthropocentric and utilitarian dimensions of human-nature relationships with notions of nature as separate from humans, though more inclusion of cultural perspectives and intrinsic values are emerging. More explicit attention to broader, diverse interpretations from local stakeholders may inform the operationalization of the ecosystem services concept for landscape planning processes. Context matters greatly, as people may hold multiple, even competing perspectives on their relationship with or role in nature, and they may change across different circumstances or time. Further research is needed to understand communication and mobilization strategies for sustainable action within landscapes. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The emerging field of mechanistic niche modelling aims to link the functional traits of organisms to their environments to predict survival, reproduction, distribution and abundance. This approach has great potential to increase our understanding of the impacts of environmental change on individuals, populations and communities by providing functional connections between physiological and ecological response to increasingly available spatial environmental data. By their nature, such mechanistic models are more data intensive in comparison with the more widely applied correlative approaches but can potentially provide more spatially and temporally explicit predictions, which are often needed by decision makers. A poorly explored issue in this context is the appropriate level of temporal resolution of input data required for these models, and specifically the error in predictions that can be incurred through the use of temporally averaged data. Here, we review how biomechanical principles from heat-transfer and metabolic theory are currently being used as foundations for mechanistic niche models and consider the consequences of different temporal resolutions of environmental data for modelling the niche of a behaviourally thermoregulating terrestrial lizard. We show that fine-scale temporal resolution (daily) data can be crucial for unbiased inference of climatic impacts on survival, growth and reproduction. This is especially so for species with little capacity for behavioural buffering, because of behavioural or habitat constraints, and for detecting temporal trends. However, coarser-resolution data (long-term monthly averages) can be appropriate for mechanistic studies of climatic constraints on distribution and abundance limits in thermoregulating species at broad spatial scales.

   TERRESTRIAL ECOSYSTEMS; NICHE COMPLEMENTARITY
AB The positive relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning (BEF) is due mainly to complementarity between species. Most BEF studies primarily focused on plant interactions; however, plants are embedded in a dense network of multitrophic interactions above and below the ground, which are likely to play a crucial role in BEF relationships.
   In the present review I point out the relevance of aboveground-belowground interactions as a source of complementarity effects in grassland biodiversity experiments. A review of the current knowledge on the role of decomposers, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, rhizobia, plant growth promoting rhizobacteria, invertebrate ecosystem engineers, herbivores, pathogens and predators in biodiversity experiments, indicates that soil biota can drive both positive and negative complementarity between plant species via a multitude of mechanisms.
   I pose four main processes by which aboveground-belowground interactions determine positive complementarity effects: enlarging biotope space, mediating legume effects, increasing plant community resistance, and maintaining plant diversity. By contrast, soil biota may also reinforce negative complementarity effects by competing with plants for nutrients or by exerting herbivore or pathogen pressure, thereby reducing community productivity. Thus, considering aboveground-belowground interactions as well as interactions between antagonistic and mutualistic consumers may improve the mechanistic understanding of complementarity effects in plant diversity-ecosystem functioning experiments and should inspire future research.

AB Species distribution models are important tools to explore the effects of future global change on biodiversity. Specifically, AquaMaps, Maxent and the Sea Around Us Project algorithm are three approaches that have been applied to predict distributions of marine fishes and invertebrates. They were designed to cope with issues of data quality and quantity common in species distribution modelling, and especially pertinent to the marine environment. However, the characteristics of model projections for marine species from these different approaches have rarely been compared. Such comparisons provide information about the robustness and uncertainty of the projections, and are thus important for spatial planning and developing management and conservation strategies. Here we apply the three commonly used species distribution modelling methods for commercial fish in the North Sea and North Atlantic, with the aim of drawing comparisons between the approaches. The effect of different assumptions within each approach on the predicted current relative habitat suitability was assessed. Predicted current distributions were tested following data partitioning and selection of pseudoabsences from within a specified distance of occurrence data. As indicated by the test statistics, each modelling method produced plausible predictions of relative habitat suitability for each species, with subsequent incorporation of expert knowledge generally improving predictions. However, because of the differences between modelling algorithms, methodologies and patterns of relative suitability, comparing models using test statistics and selecting a 'best' model are not recommended. We propose that a multi-model approach should be preferred and a suite of possible predictions considered if biases due to uncertainty in data and model formulation are to be minimised.

AB In the boreal forest of North America, as in any fire-prone biome, three environmental factors must coincide for a wildfire to occur: an ignition source, flammable vegetation, and weather that is conducive to fire. Despite recent advances, the relative importance of these factors remains the subject of some debate. The aim of this study was to develop models that identify the environmental controls on spatial patterns in area burned for the period 1980-2005 at several spatial scales in the Canadian boreal forest. Boosted regression tree models were built to relate high-resolution data for area burned to an array of explanatory variables describing ignitions, vegetation, and long-term patterns in fire-conducive weather (i.e., fire climate) at four spatial scales (10(2) km(2), 10(3) km(2), 10(4) km(2), and 10(5) km(2)). We evaluated the relative contributions of these controls on area burned, as well as their functional relationships, across spatial scales. We also assessed geographic patterns of the influence of wildfire controls. The results indicated that extreme temperature during the fire season was a top control at all spatial scales, followed closely by a wind-driven index of ease of fire spread. However, the contributions of some variables differed substantially among the spatial scales, as did their relationship to area burned. In fact, for some key variables the polarity of relationships was inverted from the finest to the broadest spatial scale. It was difficult to unequivocally attribute values of relative importance to the variables chosen to represent ignitions, vegetation, and climate, as the interdependence of these factors precluded clear partitioning. Furthermore, the influence of a variable on patterns of area burned often changed enormously across the biome, which supports the idea that fire-environment relationships in the boreal forest are complex and nonstationary.

AB P>1. The most effective way to manage nonindigenous species and their impacts is to prevent their introduction via vector regulation. While ships' ballast water is very well studied and this vector is actively managed, hull fouling has received far less attention and regulations are only now being considered despite its importance for introductions to coastal, marine systems.
   2. We conducted comprehensive in situ sampling and video recording of hulls of 40 transoceanic vessels to assess propagule and colonization pressure in Vancouver and Halifax, dominant coastal ports in Canada. Concomitant sampling was conducted of harbour fouling communities to compare hull and port communities as part of a vector risk assessment.
   3. Although this vector has been operational for a long time, hull and harbour communities were highly divergent, with mean S circle divide rensen's similarity values of 0 center dot 03 in Halifax and 0 center dot 01 in Vancouver, suggesting invasion risk is high. Propagule pressure (up to 600 000 ind. ship-1) and colonization pressure (up to 156 species ship-1) were high and varied significantly between ports, with Vancouver receiving much higher abundances and diversity of potential invaders. The higher risk of fouling introductions in Vancouver is consistent with historical patterns of successful hull fouling invasions.
   4. The extent of hull fouling was modelled using ship history predictors. Propagule pressure increased with time spent in previous ports-of-call and time since last application of antifouling paint, whereas colonization pressure increased with time since last painting and with the number of regions visited by the ship. Both propagule and colonization pressure were negatively related to the time spent at sea and the latitude of ports visited.
   5. Synthesis and applications. A major challenge for applied invasion ecology is the effective management of introduction vectors. We found that hull fouling has a strong potential for introduction of many species to coastal marine habitats and that management should be considered. Simple variables related to the vessels' hull husbandry, voyage, and sailing patterns may be used to predict and manage hull fouling intensity. The results presented here should interest policy makers and environmental managers who seek to reduce invasion risk, and ship owners seeking to optimize fuel efficiency.

ID SOIL COMPACTION; SYSTEMS; WHEAT
AB Compacted subsoil layers result in shallow root systems hindering the absorption of water and nutrients by plants. Disruption of soil compacted layers can be promoted by mechanical and/or biological methods, using plants with strong root systems. The immediate and medium term effects of mechanical chiseling and crop rotations on soybean root growth and yield were evaluated during four years in Brazil. Triticale (X Triticosecale Wittmack) and sunflower (Helianthus annuus L) were grown in the autumn-winter (April-August). In the next spring (September-October/early November), designated plots were chiseled down to 0.25 m or planted to millet (Pennisetum glaucum L), sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench) and sunn hemp (Crotalaria juncea L.), grown as cover crops, preceding soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merrill). Chiseling was done only in the first year, and these plots were left fallow during the spring (September-October/early November) for the rest of the experiment. Chiseling resulted in lower soil penetration resistance and higher soybean yields in the first year. However, in the following years soybean root growth in depth was increased under rotation with triticale and pearl millet due to the presence of biopores and a decrease in soil penetration resistance. Soybean yields tended to decrease over the years in plots that were chiseled when compared with plots under crop rotation. Chiseling can be replaced by crop rotations involving species with aggressive root systems in order to alleviate deleterious effects of soil compaction on soybean yields in tropical soils. This effect is gradual, thus crop rotation will be fully effective in remediating soil compaction in a 3- to 4-year term. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Aim
   We seek to demonstrate that whilst information derived from phylogeographic and landscape genetic approaches has been used broadly to further ecological and evolutionary hypothesis testing, it can also be used to further species modelling approaches, particularly where bioclimatic and demographic methodologies are to be combined to tackle climate change adaptation and conservation planning.
   Location
   General application.
   Methods
   We start with a review of species distribution modelling studies that have used data derived from molecular marker studies, and identify which parameters can realistically be derived from molecular marker studies for inclusion in species and ecosystem distribution prediction and conservation planning.
   Results
   We find that the uptake of phylogeographic and landscape genetic methods to inform species distribution modelling studies has to date been limited (particularly the latter approaches), despite offering clear potential to improve species modelling approaches that aim to combine climatic envelope and demographic parameters. Using a series of cases studies, we demonstrate that phylogeographic approaches can be particularly useful for identifying biogeographic barriers and refugia, testing alternative demographic models, identifying concordant demographic patterns between species within a single ecosystem and testing temporal niche conservatism. We also find that landscape genetic approaches are particularly useful for quantifying landscape permeability and source/sink dynamics of meta-populations and identifying adaptive variation in the landscape. A summary of parameters that are derivable from such studies for modelling and conservation applications is provided.
   Main conclusions
   Molecular marker methods have much to offer species distribution modelling, particularly in the field of climate adaptation. Molecular information can inform on species historical dynamics and contemporary demography necessary to advance species modelling paradigms that seek to integrate climatic and demographic drivers. Furthermore, recognizing diversity below species level and incorporating this information into modelling frameworks will enable conservation managers to plan for the capture of areas of evolutionary potential.

AB The stress-gradient hypothesis (SGH) predicts that the community-wide prevalence of positive interactions, relative to negative interactions, is greater under more severe environmental conditions. Because the frequency of positive and negative interactions within a community is the aggregate of multiple pair-wise interactions, one approach to testing the SGH is to examine how pair-wise interactions vary along severity gradients. While the SGH suggests that the net outcome of an interaction should monotonically become more positive with increasing environmental severity, recent studies have suggested that the severity-interaction relationship (SIR) may rather be unimodal. We tested which of the proposed shapes of the SIR best fits the variation in the interaction between two species along two types of severity gradients on sub-Antarctic Marion Island. This was done by comparing the performance of the grass Agrostis magellanica in the presence and absence of the cushion plant Azorella selago, along both species' entire altitudinal ranges (transects spanning 4-8 km), and along a shorter (transect = 0.4 km) wind exposure gradient. Along the altitudinal transects the relative intensity, but not the absolute intensity or the importance, of the Azorella selago-Agrostis magellanica interaction increased with altitude, consistently forming a plateau-shaped SIR with a positive asymptote. Thus, while the performance of Agrostis magellanica was negatively affected by Azorella selago at low altitudes, the grass benefited from growing on the cushion plant under greater environmental severity. Along the wind exposure gradient the intensity of the interaction also became more positive with increasing environmental severity for most performance measures. This suggests that the switch from a net negative to a net positive interaction can occur across both short and long distances. Therefore, this study provides strong evidence for a plateau-shaped SIR, and confirms that the SIR is unimodal along the particular non-resource severity gradients of this study.

AB We reviewed the development of ideas and empirical Understanding about disturbance in lotic ecosystems by providing a pre-1986 historic context and highlighting major themes that have emerged in the 25 y since the inception of J-NABS Disturbance was not well incorporated into stream ecological thinking before 1986, but awareness of its significance began to emerge in the early 1980s, as demonstrated by the publication of several classic papers illustrating the ecological consequences of floods Broad recognition of disturbance as a fundamental driver in streams was crystallized by Resh et al (1988(4)) in a paper that marked the beginning of a period of intense research on disturbance. We recognized 4 subsequent research themes 1) definition of terms and concepts and development of tools for quantifying disturbances and ecological responses, 2) the disturbance renaissance, a period during which empirical research increased dramatically, 3) formalization of the significance of disturbance in streams by its incorporation into conceptual models of stream ecosystems, and 4) operationalization of disturbance for management and restoration of streams and rivers Despite remarkable progress toward understanding disturbance in lotic ecosystems in the past 25 y, opportunities for future research are numerous Increasing scope and intensity of activities underscore the need to examine interactions among disturbances and to incorporate ecological principles into management and restoration activities. New insights are likely to arise from recognition of links between geomorphic forms and processes and the ecology of disturbance Viewing streams in the context of regime shifts should also lead to new advances, particularly for restoration, because disturbances can elicit nonlinear responses Successes in these efforts Should contribute to improved Scientific Understanding and stewardship of streams and rivers.

AB Little is known about the role of migratory waterfowl in the long-distance dispersal (LDD) of seeds. We studied the gut contents of 42 teals Anas crecca collected in the Camargue, southern France, and found intact seeds of 16 species. There was no relationship between the probability that a given seed species was found intact in the lower gut, and the seed hardness or size. The number of seeds found in the oesophagus and gizzard (a measure of ingestion rate) was the only significant predictor of the occurrence of intact seeds in the lower gut, so studies of waterfowl diet can be used as surrogates of dispersal potential. In a literature review, we identified 223 seed species recorded in 25 diet studies of teal, pintail Anas acuta, wigeon A. penelope or mallard A. platyrhynchos in Europe. We considered whether limited species distribution reduces the chances that a seed can be carried to suitable habitat following LDD. Overall, 72% of plant species recorded in duck diets in southern Europe (36 of 50) were also recorded in the north, whereas 97% of species recorded in duck diets in the north (137 of 141) were also recorded in the south. This suggests a great potential for LDD, since most dispersed plants species occur throughout the migratory range of ducks. Migratory ducks are important vectors for both terrestrial and aquatic plant species, even those lacking the fleshy fruits or hooks typically used to identify seeds dispersed by birds. Finally, we show ducks are important vectors of exotic plant species. We identified 14 alien to Europe and 44 native to Europe but introduced to some European countries whose seeds have been recorded in duck diet.

AB 1. Global warming has increased the mean surface temperature of the Earth by 0.6 degrees C in the past century, and temperature is probably to increase by an additional 3 degrees C by 2100. Water temperature has also increased, which in turn can affect metabolic rate in rivers. Such an increase in metabolic rate could alter the role of river networks in the global C cycle, because the fraction of allochthonous organic C that is respired may increase.
   2. Laboratory-based incubations at increasing water temperature were used to estimate the temperature dependence of benthic respiration in streams. These experiments were performed on stones taken from seven reaches with different thermal conditions (mean temperature ranging 8-19 degrees C) within the pre-alpine Thur River network in Switzerland, June-October 2007.
   3. The activation energy of respiration in different reaches along the river network (0.53 +/- 0.12 eV, n = 94) was similar, indicating that respiration was constrained by the activation energy of the respiratory complex (E = 0.62 eV). Water temperature and the thickness of the benthic biofilm influence the temperature dependence of respiration and our results suggest that an increase of 2.5 degrees C will increase river respiration by an average of 20 +/- 1.6%.

AB 1. Under the effects of rapid environmental change, such as climate change and land degradation, assessment of plant species potential distribution is becoming increasingly important for conservation purposes. Moreover, land administrators need reliable predictions of species suitability for planning a wide range of management activities.
   2. In this study, we used the recent Maxent algorithm for modelling the niche of Arnica montana within a Site of Community Importance in the Alps, with the ultimate aim of providing a rigorous evidence base for management of this locally threatened species. We built a final suitability map taking into account (i) the minimization of spatial autocorrelation through the use of a constrained random split of sampled data; (ii) the use of a stepwise selection of predictors in order to obtain a reduced model containing only meaningful variables; (iii) the comparison of the predictive power of three sets of environmental predictors; (iv) the identification of the most suitable areas by overlaying predictions of three competing models; (v) the use of divergence maps as a complement to conventional performance comparison assessments.
   3. Maxent improved accuracy both on training and test data sets. Elevation, geomorphology and hosting habitats performed as effective primary predictors. A reduced model based on the outcomes of a preliminary stepwise selection analysis of predictors gave the best accuracy score on test data. Two parts of the study area have been selected for management as a result of areas of agreement between the three competing models.
   4. Synthesis and applications. There remain important methodological issues that need to be improved in order to increase confidence in niche modelling and ensure that reintroduction and management activities for threatened or rare plant species are based on reliable distribution models. Modellers can improve predictions of plant distribution by addressing methodological topics that are often overlooked, as demonstrated for A. montana in this study.

AB In 1998, a unique subterranean ecosystem was discovered in numerous isolated calcrete (carbonate) aquifers in the arid Yilgarn region of Western Australia. Previous morphological and genetic analyses of a subterranean water beetle fauna suggest that calcrete aquifers are equivalent to closed island habitats that have been isolated for millions of years. We tested this hypothesis further by phylogeographic analyses of subterranean amphipods (Crangonyctoidea: Paramelitidae and Hyalidae) using mitochondrial DNA sequence data derived from the cytochrome oxidase I gene. Phylogenetic analyses and population genetic analyses (samova) provided strong evidence for the existence of at least 16 crangonyctoid and six hyalid divergent mitochondrial lineages, each restricted in their distribution to a single calcrete aquifer, in support of the 'subterranean island (archipelago) hypothesis' and extending its scope to include entirely water respiring invertebrates. Sequence divergence estimates between proximate calcrete populations suggest that calcretes have been isolated at least since the Pliocene, coinciding with a major aridity phase that led to the intermittent drying of surface water. The distribution of calcretes along palaeodrainage channels and on either side of drainage divides, have had less influence on the overall phylogeographic structure of populations, with evidence that ancestral crangonyctoid and hyalid species moved between catchments multiple times prior to their isolation within calcretes. At least two potential modes of evolution may account for the diversity of subterranean amphipod populations: dispersal/vicariance of stygobitic species or colonization of calcretes by surface species and independent evolution of stygobitic characteristics.

AB Pattern-process analysis is one of the main threads in landscape ecological research. It aims at understanding the complex relationships between ecological processes and landscape patterns, identifying the underlying mechanisms and deriving valid predictions for scenarios of landscape change and its consequences. Today, various studies cope with these tasks through so called "landscape modelling" approaches. They integrate different aspects of heterogeneous and dynamic landscapes and model different driving forces, often using both statistical and process-oriented techniques. We identify two main approaches to deal with the analysis of pattern-process interactions: the first starts with pattern detection, pattern description and pattern analysis, the second with process description, simulation and pattern generation. Focussing on the interplay between these two approaches, landscape analysis and landscape modelling will improve our understanding of pattern-process interactions. The comparison of simulated and observed pattern is a prerequisite for both approaches. Therefore, we identify a set of quantitative, robust, and reproducible methods for the analysis of spatiotemporal patterns that is a starting point for a standard toolbox for ecologists as major future challenge and suggest necessary further methodological developments.

AB The double cropping of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and summer maize (Zea mays L.) in the North China Plain (NCP) requires intensive irrigation that results in rapidly depleting aquifers and threatens the sustainable agricultural development in the region. This study investigated the possibility of growing winter wheat and maize with minimum irrigation (MI) by bringing soil moisture in the top root zone to field capacity at sowing with no further irrigation afterwards. Results over 8 yr (1997-2005) showed that grain yield of winter wheat was over 5000 kg ha(-1) and maize was over 6000 kg ha-1 in most of the seasons under MI. The average yield was decreased by 14% for winter wheat and 13% for maize compared with the fully irrigated treatment (FI). Water use efficiency (WUE) under MI was increased by 15% for winter wheat and 10% for maize compared with that under FI. Average seasonal evapotranspiration (ET) was 335 mm under MI and 447 non under FI for winter wheat, and 319 mm and 403 mm for maize, respectively. The annual irrigation requirement of MI was only half that of FI. Yield reduction in MI was negatively related to seasonal rainfall (significant at P < 0.05). The success of MI depended on the deeper root system of winter wheat using soil moisture that accumulated below the shallower rooted maize over the summer rainfall season. The results showed that an MI strategy that would be simple to implement for farmers would contribute significantly to the sustainability of the groundwater resource.

AB Aim We explored the relative contributions of climatic and land-cover factors in explaining the distribution patterns of butterflies in a boreal region.
   Location Finland, northern Europe.
   Methods Data from a national butterfly atlas survey carried out during 1991 2003, with a 10-km grain grid system, were used in these analyses. We used generalized additive models (GAM) and hierarchical partitioning (HP) to explore the main environmental correlates (climate and land-cover) of the realized niches of 98 butterfly species. The accuracy of the distribution models (GAMs) was validated by resubstitution and cross-validation approaches, using the area under the curve (AUC) derived from the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) plots.
   Results Predictive accuracies of the 98 individual environment-butterfly models varied from low to very high (cross-validated AUC values 0.48-0.99), with a mean of 0.79. The results of both the GAM and HP analyses were broadly concordant. Most of the variation in butterfly distributions is associated with growing degree-days, mean temperature of the coldest month and cover of built-up area in all six phylogenetic groups (butterfly families). There were no statistically significant differences in predictive accuracy among the different butterfly families.
   Main conclusions About three-quarters of the distributions of butterfly species in Finland appear to be governed principally by climatic, predominantly temperature-related, factors. This indicates that many butterfly species may respond rapidly to the projected climate change in boreal regions. By determining the ecological niches of multiple species, we can project their range shifts in response to changes in climate and land-cover, and identify species that are particularly sensitive to forecasted global changes.

AB Maritime pine (Pinus pinaster) is the main tree cropping species in the Landes of Gascogne forest range in south western France. Soils are nutrient poor, sandy podzosols and site fertility is determined essentially by organic matter content and depth of water table, which is known to limit root growth. We hypothesised, with an ultimate goal of constructing a nutrient uptake model applicable to this region, that the organic top horizons together with the depth of the water table should be the most important parameters related to fine root distribution and presence of associated mycorrhiza. To test this hypothesis, we compared two adult Pinus pinaster stands, contrasting in depth of water table and soil fertility and evaluated fine roots (diameter < 2 mm) of understory species and fine roots and ectomycorrhizal morphotypes of Pinus pinaster down to 1.2 m, using a soil corer approach. Total fine root biomass of Pinus pinaster was not significantly different between both sites (3.6 and 4.5 t ha(-1) for the humid, respectively, dry site), but root distribution was significantly shallower and root diameter increased more with depth at the humid site, presumably due to more adverse soil conditions as related to the presence of a hardpan, higher amount of aluminium oxides and/or anoxia. Fine roots of Pinus pinaster represented only about 30% of total fine root biomass and 15% of total fine root length, suggesting that the understory species cannot be ignored with regards to competition for mineral nutrients and water. A comparison of the ectomycorrhizal morphotypes showed that the humid site could be characterised by a very large proportion of contact exploration types, thought to be more relevant in accessing organic nutrient sources, whereas the dry site had a significantly higher proportion of both long-distance and short-distance exploration types, the latter of which was thought to be more resistant to short-term drought periods. These results partly confirm our hypothesis on root distribution as related to the presence of soil mineral nutrients (i.e. in organic matter), point out the potential role of understory plant species and ectomycorrhizal symbiosis and are a valuable step in building a site-specific nutrient uptake model.

AB Motivation: Recombination plays an important role in the evolution of many pathogens, such as HIV or malaria. Despite substantial prior work, there is still a pressing need for efficient and effective methods of detecting recombination and analyzing recombinant sequences.
   Results: We introduce Recco, a novel fast method that, given a multiple sequence alignment, scores the cost of obtaining one of the sequences from the others by mutation and recombination. The algorithm comes with an illustrative visualization tool for locating recombination breakpoints. We analyze the sequence alignment with respect to all choices of the parameter alpha weighting recombination cost against mutation cost. The analysis of the resulting cost curve yields additional information as to which sequence might be recombinant. On random genealogies Recco is comparable in its power of detecting recombination with the algorithm Geneconv (Sawyer, 1989). For specific relevant recombination scenarios Recco significantly outperforms Geneconv.

AB Based on the sexually selected infanticide (SSI) hypothesis, infanticide can be an adaptive mating strategy for males, but this is has rarely been documented in non-social mammals. This phenomenon should not benefit females, so one would expect females to evolve mating counter strategies in order to protect their infants from infanticidal males. Cases of SSI are extremely difficult to document in the field, especially for non-social species. Using field observations and genetic methods, we describe mating strategies employed by both sexes of brown bears (Ursus arctos) in relation to SSI. We present evidence for the first time suggesting that infanticide is an adaptive male mating strategy in this non-social carnivore, as all requirements for SSI are fulfilled (1) infanticide shortens the time to the mother's next estrus, (2) the perpetrator is not the father of the killed infants, and (3) putative perpetrators sire the next litter. Moreover, all infanticide cases occurred during the mating season. We expected that primarily immigrant males were infanticidal, as in social species. However, we found that resident adult males commonly committed infanticide. Perhaps they recognize females they have mated with previously. Moreover, we used DNA-based parentage testing to demonstrate a minimum of 14.5% of multiple paternities (up to 28% for litters with at least three young). Female promiscuity to confuse paternity may be an adaptive counter strategy to avoid infanticide.

AB Bonelli's eagle, Hieraaetus fasciatus, has recently suffered a severe population decline and is currently endangered. Spain supports about 70% of the European population. We used stepwise logistic regression on a set of environmental, spatial and human variables to model Bonelli's eagle distribution in the 5167 UTM 10 x 10 km quadrats of peninsular Spain. We obtained a model based on 16 variables, which allowed us to identify favourable and unfavourable areas for this species in Spain, as well as intermediate favourability areas. We assessed the stepwise progression of the model by comparing the model's predictions in each step with those of the final model, and selected a parsimonious explanatory model based on three variables - slope, July temperature and precipitation - comprising 76% of the predictive capacity of the final model. The reported presences in favourable and unfavourable areas suggest a source-sink dynamics in Bonelli's eagle Populations. The fragmented spatial structure of the favourable areas suggests the existence of a superimposed metapopulation dynamics. Previous LIFE (The Financial Instrument of the European Union for the Environment and Nature) projects for the conservation of this species have focused mainly on the northern limit of its range, where the sharpest population decline has been recorded. In these areas, favourability is low and Bonelli's eagle populations are probably maintained by the immigration of juveniles produced in more favourable zones. However, southern populations, although stable, show signs of reduction in productivity, which could menace the population sizes in the whole study area. We suggest that conservation efforts should focus also on known favourable areas, which might favour population persistence in unfavourable areas through dispersal.

AB Sequences from complete mitochondrial control legions (mtDNA CR) were used to infer phylogenetic relationships in 25 Cervinae taxa. Cervus splits into clades that are partially discordant with current species delimitations. Nominate Cervus elaphus includes two divergent clades that must be referred to as species elaphus (European elaphoid deer) and canadensis (Eurasian and North American wapitoid deer). Cervus nippon splits into Japanese and continental plus Taiwan sika. Pere David's deer is nested within Cervus. suggesting that Elaphurus should be merged with Cen,us. European and Persian fallow deer are genetically divergent and distinct species. Sequence length varied due to a CR-I insertion, tandemly repented twice in rusa and sambar deer, sika and wapiti, and repeated up to six times in a clade of Japanese sika. Variable copy numbers of this repeat are also fixed in different sika subspecies, and could be used as a diagnostic marker for subspecies. Sequence variability at the mtDNA CR is informative for defining species and subspecies boundaries, and for locating the geographical origin of captive-reared stocks. Natural and fanned populations of some species have been deeply affected by human management and the conservation of deer populations would be aided by the appropriate identification of the different evolutionary and taxonomic: units.

AB North-western North America has been repeatedly glaciated over most of the past two million years, with the most recent glaciation occurring between 60 000 and 10 000 years ago. Intraspecific genetic variation in many species has been shaped by where they survived glaciation and what postglacial recolonization routes were used. In this study, molecular techniques were used to investigate biogeographical, taxonomic and conservation issues in rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variation was assessed using a restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis, focusing mainly on the previously understudied northern extent of the species' range. Two phylogenetically distinct mitochondrial lineages were found that differed from each other by up to 1.8% in sequence. Although the geographical distributions of the two clades overlap extensively, diversity and distributional analyses strongly suggest that trout survived glaciation in both coastal and inland refugia followed by postglacial gene flow and secondary contact. Postglacial dispersal into British Columbia most likely occurred from the Queen Charlotte Islands and the Columbia River. Although trout most likely also survived glaciation along the coast of Washington, Oregon and California, as well as near the Bering Strait, evidence suggests that dispersal into British Columbia from these areas was limited. Sequence analysis of mitochondrial haplotypes revealed higher diversity in California than in the northern part of the species' range, indicating an ancient presence of the species in the south. Phylogeographic divergence probably predates adaptive variation in the species as suggested by evidence for parallel evolution of life history types across the range of O, mykiss.

AB This review examines the ecological traits and ecophysiological characteristics of the common ash (Fraxinus excelsior L.) that help to explain the current spread of ash communities in Europe. As a consequence of anthropogenic disturbance, the common ash has experienced new environmental conditions and the frequency of the species has fluctuated over space and time. Owing to its ubiquity, over the last few decades the common ash has been greatly favoured in areas abandoned by agriculture and also along impounded rivers. F: excelsior is a mesophilic species that usually thrives on alluvial soils and can also survive the strong water deficit on hillslopes. Drought tolerance in ash trees is related to stomatal regulation, a decrease in osmotic potential and also an increase in the elastic modulus epsilon. Malic acid plays a central role in draught tolerance, first as one of the major solutes involved in osmotic adjustment, and second as an effector for stomatal regulation through a drought-induced increase in its xylem concentration.

AB This paper deals with a year-round trawl ban implemented in 1990 in the Gulf of Castellammare (NW Sicily, Mediterranean Sea) over an area of about 100 km(2), with the purpose of fish stock rebuilding. Artisanal and recreational fishing were permitted in the Gulf. To assess the effect of the ban on the abundance of demersal resources, CPUE from experimental trawl surveys carried out before the ban (spring 1987 and 1989) and 4 years after it was in place (spring 1994) were compared. Sampling design was based on three depth strata (10-50, 51-100, 101-200 m); 71 and 30 hauls were made before and after the ban, respectively. Eleven target species (9 finfish and 2 cephalopods) as well as the total catch were used for comparisons. The total catch underwent an 8-fold increase in biomass after the four-year ban, and all the considered species underwent an increase, ranging from 1.2-fold for musky octopus (Eledone moschata) to 497-fold for gurnard (Lepidotrigla cavillone). The only decrease was for horned octopus (Eledone cirrhosa).
   A management strategy based on year-round trawling bans may prove useful, especially in areas where multispecies and multigear artisanal fisheries make up a large part of the fishing industry. The promising results obtained in the Gulf indicate an approach which might be practicable in areas where pre-existing data useful for traditional assessment and management are poor, or totally lacking, and where resources are already at risk of of overexploitation.

AB Understanding the importance of parasites in affecting the biodiversity of host species in ecosystems is a central aim of conservation biology. Recent advances in ecology have suggested that differential parasite susceptibilities between taxonomically related host species may be a determinant of animal community structure. Although conceptually appealing, such an hypothesis suffers from a lack of field evidence. Here, we report that the populations of two congeneric and sympatric host species (Gammarus insensibilis and G. aequicauda), infected by the same parasite (Microphallus papillorobustus), exhibit a strongly contrasted pattern of parasite-induced mortality.

AB Biological production estimates of 100 fish populations from 38 lakes worldwide were gathered from the literature. The relationship between the annual production of fish populations (P, kilograms per hectare per year), annual mean standing biomass (B, kilograms per hectare), and maximum individual body mass (W, grams) was approximately log10P = 0.32 + 0.94 log10B - 0.17 log10W (R2 = 0.84). This relationship is similar to one observed for lotic invertebrate populations and shows that P declines with W. Major axis regression indicated that the P/B:W relationship had an exponent similar to that predicted by allometric theory. The residuals from this multivariate equation suggest that fish production is positively correlated with temperature, lake phosphorus concentration, chlorophyll a concentration, primary production, and with pH. The results suggest a general bottom-up control of lake ecosystem components. The morphoedaphic index is not a good predictor of the production of fish populations. Assuming that sustainable yield is about 10% of production, sustainable yield would be less than 15% of the standing biomass for the majority of fish populations analyzed. Exploited populations were found to be about 70% more productive, on average, than unexploited populations of the same standing biomass and body-mass.

Here, we investigated key hydraulic and carbon economy traits of 12 woody species in Australia from a broad climatic gradient, with the aim of identifying the coordination among these traits and the role of climate in shaping cross-species trait variation. The influence of environmental variation was minimized by a common garden approach, allowing us to factor out the influence of environment on phenotypic variation across species. We found that hydraulic traits (leaf turgor loss point, stomatal sensitivity to drought [P-gs], xylem vulnerability to cavitation [P-x], and branch capacitance [C-branch]) were highly coordinated across species and strongly related to rainfall and aridity in the species native distributional range. In addition, trade-offs between drought tolerance and plant growth rate were observed across species. Collectively, these results provide critical insight into the coordination among hydraulic traits in modulating drought adaptation and will significantly advance our ability to predict drought vulnerability in these dominant trees species.

AB Inbreeding (mating between relatives) is a major concern for conservation as it decreases individual fitness and can increase the risk of population extinction. We used whole-genome resequencing of 97 grey wolves (Canis lupus) from the highly inbred Scandinavian wolf population to identify 'identical-by-descent' (IBD) chromosome segments as runs of homozygosity (ROH). This gave the high resolution required to precisely measure realized inbreeding as the IBD fraction of the genome in ROH (F-ROH). We found a striking pattern of complete or near-complete homozygosity of entire chromosomes in many individuals. The majority of individual inbreeding was due to long IBD segments (>5 cM) originating from ancestors <= 10 generations ago, with 10 genomic regions showing very few ROH and forming candidate regions for containing loci contributing strongly to inbreeding depression. Inbreeding estimated with an extensive pedigree (F-P) was strongly correlated with realized inbreeding measured with the entire genome (r(2) = 0.86). However, inbreeding measured with the whole genome was more strongly correlated with multi-locus heterozygosity estimated with as few as 500 single nucleotide polymorphisms, and with F-ROH estimated with as few as 10,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms, than with F-P. These results document in fine detail the genomic consequences of intensive inbreeding in a population of conservation concern.

AB Understanding the relationship between short-term subway ridership and its influential factors is crucial to improving the accuracy of short-term subway ridership prediction. Although there has been a growing body of studies on short-term ridership prediction approaches, limited effort is made to investigate the short-term subway ridership prediction considering bus transfer activities and temporal features. To fill this gap, a relatively recent data mining approach called gradient boosting decision trees (GBDT) is applied to short-term subway ridership prediction and used to capture the associations with the independent variables. Taking three subway stations in Beijing as the cases, the short-term subway ridership and alighting passengers from its adjacent bus stops are obtained based on transit smart card data. To optimize the model performance with different combinations of regularization parameters, a series of GBDT models are built with various learning rates and tree complexities by fitting a maximum of trees. The optimal model performance confirms that the gradient boosting approach can incorporate different types of predictors, fit complex nonlinear relationships, and automatically handle the multicollinearity effect with high accuracy. In contrast to other machine learning methods-or "black-box" procedures-the GBDT model can identify and rank the relative influences of bus transfer activities and temporal features on short-term subway ridership. These findings suggest that the GBDT model has considerable advantages in improving short-term subway ridership prediction in a multimodal public transportation system.

AB We used a statistical learning framework to evaluate the ability of three machine-learning methods to predict nitrate concentration in shallow groundwater of the Central Valley, California: boosted regression trees (BRT), artificial neural networks (ANN), and Bayesian networks (BN). Machine learning methods can learn complex patterns in the data but because of overfitting may not generalize well to new data. The statistical learning framework involves cross-validation (CV) training and testing data and a separate hold-out data set for model evaluation, with the goal of optimizing predictive performance by controlling for model overfit. The order of prediction performance according to both CV testing R-2 and that for the hold-out data set was BRT > BN > ANN. For each method we identified two models based on CV testing results: that with maximum testing R-2 and a version with R-2 within one standard error of the maximum (the 1SE model). The former yielded CV training R-2 values of 0.94-1.0. Cross-validation testing le values indicate predictive performance, and these were 0.22-0.39 for the maximum R-2 models and 0.19-0.36 for the 1SE models. Evaluation with hold-out data suggested that the 1SE BRT and ANN models predicted better for an independent data set compared with the maximum R-2 versions, which is relevant to extrapolation by mapping. Scatterplots of predicted vs. observed hold-out data obtained for final models helped identify prediction bias, which was fairly pronounced for ANN and BN. Lastly, the models were compared with multiple linear regression (MLR) and a previous random forest regression (RFR) model. Whereas BRT results were comparable to RFR, MLR had low hold-out R-2 (0.07) and explained less than half the variation in the training data. Spatial patterns of predictions by the final, 1SE BRT model agreed reasonably well with previously observed patterns of nitrate occurrence in groundwater of the Central Valley.

AB The consequences of global change for the maintenance of species diversity will depend on the sum of each species responses to the environment and on the interactions among them. A wide ecological literature supports that these species-specific responses can arise from factors related to life strategies, evolutionary history and intraspecific variation, and also from environmental variation in space and time. In the light of recent advances from coexistence theory combined with mechanistic explanations of diversity maintenance, we discuss how global change drivers can influence species coexistence. We revise the importance of both competition and facilitation for understanding coexistence in different ecosystems, address the influence of phylogenetic relatedness, functional traits, phenotypic plasticity and intraspecific variability, and discuss lessons learnt from invasion ecology. While most previous studies have focused their efforts on disentangling the mechanisms that maintain the biological diversity in species-rich ecosystems such as tropical forests, grasslands and coral reefs, we argue that much can be learnt from pauci-specific communities where functional variability within each species, together with demographic and stochastic processes becomes key to understand species interactions and eventually community responses to global change.

AB Concrete flood defences, erosion control structures, port and harbour facilities, and renewable energy infrastructure are increasingly being built in the world's coastal regions. There is, however, strong evidence to suggest that these structures are poor surrogates for natural rocky shores, often supporting assemblages with lower species abundance and diversity. Ecological engineering opportunities to enhance structures for biodiversity conservation (and other management goals) are therefore being sought, but the majority of work so far has concentrated on structural design features at the centimetre-meter scale.
   We deployed concrete tiles with four easily-reproducible fine-scale (millimetre) textures (control, smoothed, grooved and exposed aggregate) in the intertidal zone to test opportunities for facilitating colonisation by a dominant ecosystem engineer (barnacles) relative to natural rock. Concrete texture had a significant effect on colonisation; smoothed tiles supported significantly fewer numbers of barnacles, and those with intermediate roughness (grooved concrete) significantly greater numbers, after one settlement season.
   The successful recruitment of early colonists is a critical stage in the development of more complex and diverse macrobenthic assemblages, especially those that provide physical habitat structure for other species. Our observations show that this can be facilitated relatively simply for barnacles on marine concrete by manipulating surface heterogeneity at a millimetre scale. Alongside other larger-scale manipulation (e.g. creating holes and pools), including fine-scale habitat heterogeneity in engineering designs can support international efforts to maximise the ecological value of marine urban infrastructure.

AB A central goal of functional ecology is to determine how independent functional traits are selectively filtered by environmental conditions to improve our understanding of the mechanisms of community assembly. Soil fertility clearly influences community composition, but it is unclear which plant functional traits are most strongly associated with gradients of increasing nutrient limitation. We hypothesized that leaf economic traits and stem tissue density would be strongly associated with soil fertility given their direct relationship to soil resource acquisition and use. In contrast, we hypothesized that functional traits that are commonly associated with competition for light (maximum height), shade tolerance (seed mass) and resistance to disturbance (bark thickness) would be unrelated to soil fertility. We measured 13 functional traits from 30 tree species occurring in 40 plots across a soil fertility gradient in a mature warm temperate rain forest in Northland, New Zealand. Principal component analysis was used to assess the dimensionality and independence of the functional traits and the soil properties, and regression was used to determine the relationships between community-weighted mean traits and the soil fertility gradient. We observed a coordinated response of multiple independent traits to soil fertility. Consistent with our hypothesis, species associated with low-fertility soils had comparatively slower' leaves (i.e. low SLA and leaf N and P, and high LDMC and thickness) and higher stem tissue density than species associated with high-fertility soils. Unexpectedly, we observed that species associated with low-fertility soils had larger maximum heights, thicker bark and lower seed mass. Tall trees can persist on poor soils. Thick bark may be a defensive strategy for trees growing in resource-limited sites and large-seeded shade-tolerant species can persist in fertile soils where light is more limiting.Synthesis. Species sorting can occur over short distances in ecosystems where topographically driven variation in soil fertility leads to complete compositional turnover. Inferences about species distributions based on single-trait spectrums can be misleading when environmental gradients sort species by filtering multiple independent traits simultaneously. Identifying the multidimensional trait combinations that promote fitness will advance both theory development and ecological restoration.

AB Phylogenetic relationships of the primarily wingless insects are still considered unresolved. Even the most comprehensive phylogenomic studies that addressed this question did not yield congruent results. To get a grip on these problems, we here analyzed the sources of incongruence in these phylogenomic studies by using an extended transcriptome data set. Our analyses showed that unevenly distributed missing data can be severely misleading by inflating node support despite the absence of phylogenetic signal. In consequence, only decisive data sets should be used which exclusively comprise data blocks containing all taxa whose relationships are addressed. Additionally, we used Four-cluster Likelihood Mapping (FcLM) to measure the degree of congruence among genes of a data set, as a measure of support alternative to bootstrap. FcLM showed incongruent signal among genes, which in our case is correlated neither with functional class assignment of these genes nor with model misspecification due to unpartitioned analyses. The herein analyzed data set is the currently largest data set covering primarily wingless insects, but failed to elucidate their interordinal phylogenetic relationships. Although this is unsatisfying from a phylogenetic perspective, we try to show that the analyses of structure and signal within phylogenomic data can protect us from biased phylogenetic inferences due to analytical artifacts.

AB Globally, photosynthesis accounts for the largest flux of CO2 from the atmosphere into ecosystems and is the driving process for terrestrial ecosystem function. The importance of accurate predictions of photosynthesis over a range of plant growth conditions led to the development of a C-3 photosynthesis model by Farquhar, von Caemmerer & Berry that has become increasingly important as society places greater pressures on vegetation. The photosynthesis model has played a major role in defining the path towards scientific understanding of photosynthetic carbon uptake and the role of photosynthesis on regulating the earth's climate and biogeochemical systems. In this review, we summarize the photosynthesis model, including its continued development and applications. We also review the implications these developments have on quantifying photosynthesis at a wide range of spatial and temporal scales, and discuss the model's role in determining photosynthetic responses to changes in environmental conditions. Finally, the review includes a discussion of the larger-scale modelling and remote-sensing applications that rely on the leaf photosynthesis model and are likely to open new scientific avenues to address the increasing challenges to plant productivity over the next century.

AB Spatial marine closures are widely employed and advocated for marine resource management and conservation. Temporal, non-permanent, rotational or periodically harvested area closures have been employed across the Indo:Pacific for centuries and are a common measure within contemporary community-based and co-management frameworks. Although prior evidence suggests that periodic closures may confer fisheries benefits for some taxa or in certain conditions, there is little evidence that they are equally effective for the sustainable management of the many types of small-scale fisheries important in the Indo-Pacific. Case studies of periodic closures are reviewed to highlight the variations in target species, harvesting periodicity and fishing pressure that will influence the fisheries management effectiveness of this tool. Fisheries management benefits are observed for short-lived, fast-growing taxa or for a range of taxa in low fishing pressure situations. Stocks declines are observed for long-lived taxa or for a range of taxa if harvesting is intense. It is argued that community-based and co-management policy and action must better account for these factors when promoting and implementing periodic closures for medium- to long-term fisheries management or conservation goals.

AB Comparative genomic studies in primates have yielded important insights into the evolutionary forces that shape genetic diversity and revealed the likely genetic basis for certain species-specific adaptations. To date, however, these studies have focused on only a small number of species. For the majority of nonhuman primates, including some of the most critically endangered, genome-level data are not yet available. In this study, we have taken the first steps toward addressing this gap by sequencing RNA from the livers of multiple individuals from each of 16 mammalian species, including humans and 11 nonhuman primates. Of the nonhuman primate species, five are lemurs and two are lorisoids, for which little or no genomic data were previously available. To analyze these data, we developed a method for de novo assembly and alignment of orthologous gene sequences across species. We assembled an average of 5721 gene sequences per species and characterized diversity and divergence of both gene sequences and gene expression levels. We identified patterns of variation that are consistent with the action of positive or directional selection, including an 18-fold enrichment of peroxisomal genes among genes whose regulation likely evolved under directional selection in the ancestral primate lineage. Importantly, we found no relationship between genetic diversity and endangered status, with the two most endangered species in our study, the black and white ruffed lemur and the Coquerel's sifaka, having the highest genetic diversity among all primates. Our observations imply that many endangered lemur populations still harbor considerable genetic variation. Timely efforts to conserve these species alongside their habitats have, therefore, strong potential to achieve long-term success.

ID INFERENCE
AB The recent development of capture-recapture methods for estimating animal population density has focused on passive detection using devices such as traps or automatic cameras. Some species lend themselves more to active searching: a polygonal plot may be searched repeatedly and the locations of detected individuals recorded, or a plot may be searched just once and multiple cues (feces or other sign) identified as belonging to particular individuals. This report presents new likelihood-based spatially explicit capture-recapture (SECR) methods for such data. The methods are shown to be at least as robust in simulations as an equivalent Bayesian analysis, and to have negligible bias and near-nominal confidence interval coverage with parameter values from a lizard data set. It is recommended on the basis of simulation that plots for SECR should be at least as large as the home range of the target species. The R package "secr" may be used to fit the models. The likelihood-based implementation extends the spatially explicit analyses available for search data to include binary data (animal detected or not detected on each occasion) or count data (multiple detections per occasion) from multiple irregular polygons, with or without dependence among polygons. It is also shown how the method may be adapted for detections along a linear transect.

AB A mysterious parthenogenetic cambarid crayfish (the Marmorkrebs) has been spreading across the globe for the past decade. We compare this crayfish directly to two other cambarids, Procambarus fallax and P. alleni, that have been suggested to be related or even identical to the Marmorkrebs. Using external morphology and sequences of two mitochondrial genes we show clear correspondences between Marmorkrebs and P.fallax, a species found natively throughout peninsular Florida, USA. Based on these congruent results we suggest that the Marmorkrebs is the parthenogenetic form of P. fallax. This finding has potential evolutionary and ecological implications at several levels. The Marmorkrebs might be a type of geographical parthenogenesis, but a natural population in the wild is so far unknown. Furthermore, challenges arise in regard to the respective species status of the Marmorkrebs. Taxonomically we suggest that the Marmorkrebs is treated as 'parthenogenetic form' of P. fallax. Last but not least, the identity of this animal and its ecology has an impact for considering potential spread and effects of this species across the globe.

AB Mercury (Hg) is a potent toxin that biomagnifies in aquatic food webs. Large fish generally have higher Hg concentrations than small fish of the same species. However, models predict that fish that grow large faster will have lower Hg concentrations than small, slow-growing fish owing to somatic growth dilution (SGD). We examined the relationship between Hg concentration and growth rate in fish by means of a large-scale field experiment. Atlantic salmon Salmo salar fry hatched under uniform initial conditions were released at 18 sites in natural streams, collected after one growing season, and measured with respect to Hg concentration and growth. As expected for Hg accumulation from food, the Hg concentrations in the fish tracked those in their prey. Nonetheless, large, fast-growing fish had lower Hg concentrations than small, slow-growing ones, consistent with SGD. While the Hg concentration of the prey accounted for 59% of the explained variation in the Hg concentration in the Atlantic salmon across sites, the salmon growth rate accounted for 38%. A mass-balance Hg accumulation model shows that such SGD occurs when fast growth is associated with high growth efficiency. Fish growth is tremendously variable and sensitive to anthropogenic impacts, so the SGD of Hg has important implications for fisheries management.

AB Climate-induced coral bleaching frequently leads to declines in the abundance and diversity of coral-associated fishes, though the proximate causes of these declines are largely unknown. In this study, we show that coral-dwelling damselfishes associated with bleached and dead coral hosts are more susceptible to predation compared with fishes associated with healthy coral colonies. Although the predator (Pseudochromis fuscus) actively avoided both bleached and recently dead corals, they were almost twice as likely to strike at prey associated with the stark white colonies of bleached corals. These results suggest that coral-dwelling fishes are much more conspicuous against the bleached-white background, increasing their susceptibility to predation. Direct estimates of predation rates in aquaria were 33% and 37% on bleached and recently dead coral colonies, respectively, compared with 25% on healthy coral colonies. However, predation rates were highest (42%) on algal-covered corals, reflective of colonies that have further degraded after bleaching. We argue that increased susceptibility to predation may contribute to declines in abundance of coral-dwelling fishes after host coral bleaching. Even if predation does not cause increased in situ mortality, it is likely that increased exposure to predators will provide significant motivation for coral-dwelling fishes to vacate bleached coral hosts.

AB Aquatic habitat suitability models have increasingly received attention due to their wide management applications. Ecological expert knowledge has been frequently incorporated in such models to link environmental conditions to the quantitative habitat suitability of aquatic species. Since the formalisation of problem-specific human expert knowledge is often difficult and tedious, data-driven machine learning techniques may be helpful to extract knowledge from ecological datasets. In this paper, both expert knowledge-based and data-driven fuzzy habitat suitability models were developed and the performance of these models was compared. For the data-driven models, a hill-climbing optimisation algorithm was applied to derive ecological knowledge from the available data. Based on the available ecological expert knowledge and on biological samples from the Zwalm river basin (Belgium), habitat suitability models were generated for the mayfly Baetis rhodani (Pictet 1843). Data-driven models appeared to outperform expert knowledge-based models substantially, while a step-forward model selection procedure indicated that physical habitat variables adequately described the mayfly habitat suitability in the studied area. This study has important implications on the application of expert knowledge in ecological studies, especially if this knowledge is extrapolated to other areas. The results suggest that data-driven models can complement expert knowledge-based approaches and hence improve model reliability. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We characterized functional and structural properties of cytoplasmic malate dehydrogenases (cMDHs) from six limpets of the genus Lottia that have different vertical and latitudinal distributions. Particular attention was given to the cryptic species pair Lottia digitalis (northern occurring) and L. austrodigitalis (southern occurring) because of recent contraction in the southern range of L. digitalis and a northward range extension of L. austrodigitalis. As an index of adaptation of function, we measured the effects of temperature on the apparent Michaelis-Menten constant (K-m) of the cofactor NADH (K-m(NADH)). K-m(NADH) values of cMDHs from the mid- to high-intertidal, low-latitude species L. scabra and L. gigantea were less sensitive to high temperature than those of cMDHs from the low- and mid-intertidal, high-latitude species L. scutum and L. pelta. cMDH of L. digitalis was more sensitive to high temperatures than the cMDH ortholog of L. austrodigitalis. Thermal stability (rate of loss of activity at 42.5 degrees C) showed a similar pattern of interspecific variation. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences showed that interspecific differences ranged from one to as many as 17 residues. Differences in K-m(NADH) and thermal stability between orthologs of L. digitalis and L. austrodigitalis result from a single amino acid substitution. At position 291, the glycine residue in cMDH of L. digitalis is replaced by a serine in cMDH of L. austrodigitalis, a change that favors additional hydrogen bonding and reduced conformational entropy. This difference between closely related congeners demonstrates the role of minor alterations in protein sequence in temperature adaptation and suggests that such variation is important in governing shifts in biogeographic range in response to climate change.

AB Agricultural environments are critical to the conservation of biota throughout the world: Efforts to identify key influences on the conservation status of fauna in such environments have taken complementary approaches. Many studies have focused on the role of remnant or seminatural vegetation and emphasized the influence on biota of spatial patterns in the landscape. Others have recognized that many species use diverse "countryside" elements within farmland, and emphasize the benefits of landscape heterogeneity for conservation. Here, we investigated the effect of independent measures of both the spatial pattern (extent and configuration) and heterogeneity of elements (i.e., land uses/vegetation types) on bird occurrence in farm-scale agricultural mosaics in southeastern Australia. Birds were sampled in all types of elements in 27 mosaics (each I X I km) selected to incorporate variation in cover of native vegetation and the number of different element,types in the mosaic. We used an information-theoretic approach to identify the mosaic properties that most strongly influenced bird species richness. Subgroups of birds based on habitat requirements responded most strongly to the extent of preferred elements in mosaics. Woodland birds were richer in mosaics with higher cover of native vegetation while open-tolerant species responded to the extent of scattered trees. In contrast, for total species richness, mosaic heterogeneity (richness of element types) and landscape context (cover of native vegetation in surrounding area) had the greatest influence. These results showed that up to 76%, of landscape-level variation in richness of bird groups is attributable to mosaic properties directly amenable to management by landowners. Key implications include (1) conservation goals for farm landscapes must be carefully defined because the richness of different faunal components is influenced by different mosaic properties; (2) the extent of native vegetation is a critical influence in agricultural environments because it drives the farm-scale richness of woodland birds and has a broader context effect on total bird richness in mosaics; (3) land-use practices that enhance the heterogeneity of farmland mosaics are beneficial for native birds; and (4) the cumulative effect of even small elements in farm mosaics contribute to the structural properties of entire landscapes.

AB The effects of territorial damselfish on coral reef benthos have been well-studied for a few relatively large-bodied species with visually distinct territories. Despite a growing body of research demonstrating their abundance, and their effects on algae, corals and other grazers, there has been little research on the effects of the territorial damselfish community as a whole. This study investigated the space occupation, territory composition, and diet of ten damselfish species at three locations: Magnetic and Orpheus Islands (Great Barrier Reef), and Kimbe Bay (Papua New Guinea). Territories were measured, and the composition of benthic communities inside and outside territories was assessed both in situ and from algal collections. The stomach contents of territorial damselfishes were also quantified. Although the larger, previously well-studied species had the most visible effect on the benthic community in their territories, all the smaller species also significantly affected the algal composition, normally with an increase of palatable algae. However, the composition of algal assemblages inside the territories of different species varied considerably. Damselfish territories were highly individual, not just among species, but also among locations. Diets were diverse and indicated a greater degree of omnivory and detritivory than previously thought. At all locations, territories occupied a substantial proportion of the substratum: > 25% on Magnetic Island, > 50% at Orpheus Island, and similar to 50% in Kimbe Bay. Within individual zones, this figure was as high as 70%. The contribution of territorial damselfishes to a range of benthic patterns and processes is considerable, and future benthic studies may need to distinguish more closely between territory and non-territory areas.

AB Background: It is much debated whether microbes are easily dispersed globally or whether they, like many macro-organisms, have historical biogeographies. The ubiquitous dispersal hypothesis states that microbes are so numerous and so easily dispersed worldwide that all should be globally distributed and found wherever growing conditions suit them. This has been broadly upheld for protists (microbial eukaryotes) by most morphological and some molecular analyses. However, morphology and most previously used evolutionary markers evolve too slowly to test this important hypothesis adequately. Results: Here we use a fast-evolving marker (ITS1 rDNA) to map global diversity and distribution of three different clades of cercomonad Protozoa (Eocercomonas and Paracercomonas: phylum Cercozoa) by sequencing multiple environmental gene libraries constructed from 47-80 globally-dispersed samples per group. Even with this enhanced resolution, identical ITS sequences (ITStypes) were retrieved from widely separated sites and on all continents for several genotypes, implying relatively rapid global dispersal. Some identical ITS-types were even recovered from both marine and non-marine samples, habitats that generally harbour significantly different protist communities. Conversely, other ITS-types had either patchy or restricted distributions. Conclusion: Our results strongly suggest that geographic dispersal in macro-organisms and microbes is not fundamentally different: some taxa show restricted and/or patchy distributions while others are clearly cosmopolitan. These results are concordant with the 'moderate endemicity model' of microbial biogeography. Rare or continentally endemic microbes may be ecologically significant and potentially of conservational concern. We also demonstrate that strains with identical 18S but different ITS1 rDNA sequences can differ significantly in terms of morphological and important physiological characteristics, providing strong additional support for global protist biodiversity being significantly higher than previously thought.

AB Analyses of spatial patterns of distribution of populations and assemblages along envirorimental gradients are common in marine ecology. How these patterns vary at different spatial scales has seldom been examined, despite the fact that patterns in nature are intrinsically scale-dependent. This study quantified variability in subtidal assemblages at a hierarchy of spatial scales along a depth gradient, using several univariate and multivariate techniques. Despite variation in the sizes of depth effects in time and space, there were large, significant and generally characterisable differences in the structure of assemblages at different depths. The sizes of multivariate and univariate components of variation at different spatial scales were compared at each of 3 different depths (5, 15 and 25 m), using a bias-corrected bootstrapping approach. The sizes of variance components at different spatial scales varied with depth and choice of transformation. In all cases, the largest component of variation was at the smallest scale (tens of centimeters). A pattern of decreasing residual variance with depth was seen for untransformed data, while a pattern of increasing residual variance with depth was seen for presence/absence data. In contrast, variation among locations (separated by > 1 km) and among sites (separated by hundreds of metres) was largest at intermediate depths (similar to 15 m), regardless of the transformation used. The multivariate procedures used here offer several advantages over previously used techniques, providing suitable quantitative methods for analysing, at multiple scales, the patchy and complex nature of rocky subtidal assemblages.

AB It is commonly hypothesized that stand-level fine root biomass increases as soil fertility decreases both within and among tropical forests, but few data exist to test this prediction across broad geographic scales. This study investigated the relationships among fine roots, arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi and soil nutrients in four lowland, neortropical rainforests.
   Within each forest, samples were collected from plots that differed in fertility and above-ground biomass, and fine roots, AM hyphae and total soil nutrients were measured.
   Among sites, total fine root mass varied by a factor of three, from 237 +/- 19 g m(-2) in Costa Rica to 800 +/- 116 g m(-2) in Brazil (0-40 cm depth). Both root mass and length were negatively correlated to soil nitrogen and phosphorus, but Am hyphae were not related to nutrients, root properties or above-ground biomass.
   These results suggest that understanding how soil fertility affects fine roots is an additional factor that may improve the representation of root functions in global biogeochernical models or biome-wide averages of root properties in tropical forests.

AB Although habitat fragmentation is suspected to pose a major threat to biodiversity, its impact on abundant invertebrate species has been little investigated. We assessed the genetic population structure of the flightless ground beetle Abax parallelepipedus in a forest fragmented by two main roads and a highway using five microsatellite loci. We detected low levels of genetic differentiation, which was concordant with the high population densities of 632-1707 individuals/ha estimated with a mark-recapture method. A Mantel test detected a highly significant increase of pairwise F-ST-values with the number of roads between sampling locations. As expected, the most pronounced effect of the isolation due to roads was observed in the sample from the smallest fragment (highway exit loop), which was differentiated significantly from most other locations. However, no signs of a recent bottleneck or a loss of genetic variability were detected in this population, indicating a still relatively large effective population size (N-e). Computer simulations confirmed that the observed F-ST-values were indeed compatible with a N-e of a few hundred individuals in this fragment, assuming strong or absolute isolation since the construction of the roads. We discuss the implications of our findings for the conservation of abundant but poorly dispersing species in fragmented habitats.

AB The exact location of glacial refugia and the patterns of postglacial range expansion of European mammals are not yet completely elucidated. Therefore, further detailed studies covering a large part of the Western Palearctic region are still needed. In this order, we sequenced 972 bp of the mitochondrial DNA cytochrome h (mtDNA cyt b) from 124 yellow-necked fieldmice (Apodemus flavicollis) collected from 53 European localities. The aims of the study were to answer the following questions:
   Did the Mediterranean peninsulas act as the main refuge for yellow-necked fieldmouse or did the species also survive in more easterly refugia (the Caucasus or the southern Ural) and in Central Europe?
   What is the role of Turkey and Near East regions as Quaternary glacial refuges for this species and as a source for postglacial recolonisers of the Western Palearctic region?
   The results provide a clear picture of the impact of the quaternary glaciations on the genetic and geographic structure of the fieldmouse. This species survived the ice ages in two main refuges, the first one in the Italo-Balkan region; the second one in Turkey and the Near East regions. It is from the Balkan refuge that it recolonised all European regions at the end of the last glaciation. The Turkish and Near East populations are distinct from the European ones and they did not recolonise the Palearctic region probably because: (i) they were blocked by the Black Sea and the Caucasus, (ii) the long term presence of fieldmice populations in the Balkans prevented their expansion. These are genetically differentiated from the European and Russian ones and could be described as a particular subspecies. This result emphasises the importance of Turkey and the Near and Middle East regions as a refuge for Palearctic mammals. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In the Cerrado savannas from Brazil fire events are common and strongly influence the vegetation structure and, consequently, the associated small mammals. In this paper, we investigate changes in the structure of small mammal communities related to sites of different post-fire ages. Mammals were captured in similar Cerrado sites that differed in time since the last burn ( 1 to 26 yr). We sampled six sites in the wet season of 1997 ( phase 1) and, three years later, six sites in the wet and dry seasons ( phase 2). Six rodent species and four marsupials were captured. Community composition changed drastically as a function of time since fire. The diversity and abundance of small mammals reached maximum values in the early successional stages. The rodent Calomys tener was present only in early seral stages. The rodent Bolomys lasiurus was more frequent in mid-successional stages and decreased in later seral stages, and the rodent Oryzomys subflavus occupied all successional stages. The marsupial Gracilinanus agilis was dominant in the area that did not burn for at least 23 yr. Changes in composition of the community of small mammals were more accelerated in early successional stages, when there are more drastic vegetational changes. The ability of small mammals to cope with Cerrado fires and the great dissimilarity among post-burning seral stages suggest that a mosaic of areas representing different post-fire seral stages could increase the regional diversity of this group.

AB 1. Long-term data on rainfall suggests that perennial rainforest streams rarely are subject to drying of riffles or pools in the wet, non-seasonal Caribbean climate of Puerto Rico. Unusually low rainfall in 1994 caused some headwater riffles to dry out completely, resulting in isolated pools, reduced pool volumes and loss of access to microhabitats by benthic invertebrates.
   2. From 1992 to 1998, shrimp populations were sampled bimonthly using baited traps in six pools along 1200 m (from 305 to 480 m in altitude) of Quebrada Prieta, a second-order headwater stream in the Luquillo Experimental Forest (Caribbean National Forest).
   3. Following contraction of the smaller and shallower pools in the most upstream section of the stream, mean densities of the dominant shrimp (Atya lanipes ) increased from 22 to 75 shrimp m(-2) of pool area during the 1994 drought year. A second common species (Xiphocaris elongata ) increased from 5 to 14 shrimp m(-2) . A smaller percentage of adults of both species was gravid during the drought.
   4. Following the 1994 drought (1995-1998), densities of both shrimp species and reproductive activity of Atya returned to predrought (1990-1993) levels. However, the reproductive activity of Xiphocaris remained lower than in the predrought period.
   5. It is suggested that prolonged droughts, even in tropical rainforest biomes, may significantly alter aquatic communities through localised crowding effects resulting from habitat contraction, and lead to prolonged decreases in reproductive output. Consequently, major alterations in aquatic populations and communities would be predicted by current climate change scenarios of decreased total rainfall and increased variability.

AB One-year-old 'Cleopatra mandarin' (Citrus reticulata Blanco) seedlings were raised in a greenhouse and fertilized with nitrogen (N) at four application frequencies. Nitrogen-deficient leaves (86 mmol N m(-2)) had less chlorophyll per unit area, but a greater chlorophyll a:b ratio than N-fertilized leaves (> 187 mmol N m(-2)). Leaf dry mass per area (DM area(-1)) and total chlorophyll concentration increased linearly with increasing leaf N, whereas chlorophyll a:b ratio declined. Net assimilation of CO2 (A(CO2)) and leaf water-use efficiency (WUE) reached maximum values in leaves with similar to187 mmol N m(-2). Nitrogen-deficient leaves exhibited small chloroplasts with no starch granules; grana and stroma lamellae that coincided with the accretion of numerous large plastoglobuli in the stroma disintegrated. High-N leaves had large chloroplasts with well-developed grana, stroma lamellae and starch granules that enlarged with increasing N concentration. The lack of an increase in A(CO2) capacity at leaf N concentrations above 187 mmol N m(-2) appeared to be correlated with the presence of numerous large starch granules.

AB The phylogeny of the family Bacidiaceae (Lecanorales, Ascomycota) was investigated using 65 nuclear ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 ribosomal DNA sequences, 63 of which were newly determined. After exclusion of ambiguous alignment, the data set contained 285 variable characters, 212 of which were parsimony-informative. Phylogenetic estimations were performed with maximum parsimony (unweighted and weighted) and maximum likelihood optimality criteria. Four different phylogenetic hypotheses were tested using a parametric bootstrap approach to simulate the expected null distribution of the difference between the globally optimal tree and the best (constrained) tree agreeing with the null hypotheses under unweighted and weighted parsimony, and maximum likelihood: (1) the genus Bacidia is monophyletic; (2) the genus Bacidina is monophyletic; (3) the genus Toninia is monophyletic; and (4) the family Rainalinaceae is monophyletic and distinct from a monophyletic Bacidiaceae. The monophyly of Bacidia, Toninia, and the Ramalinaceae was rejected under all circumstances. Hence, Bacidiaceae is likely to be a younger synonym of Ramalinaceae. The monophyly of Bacidina was not rejected under any optimality criterion. Furthermore, the data set suggests that the Bacidia beckhausii and B. subuletorum groups are unrelated to Bacidia s. str., that Megalaria is monophyletic, and that Lecania auct. is polyphyletic.

AB Water-use efficiency (WUEDM) is directly related to radiation-use efficiency (RUE) and inversely related to crop conductance (g(c)). We propose that reduced WUEDM caused by shortage of nitrogen results from a reduction in RUE proportionally greater than the fall in conductance. This hypothesis was tested in irrigated wheat crops grown with contrasting nitrogen supply; treatments were 0, 80 and 120 kg N ha(-1) in 1998 and 0, 80, 120 and 160 kg N ha(-1) in 1999. We measured shoot dry matter, yield, intercepted solar radiation and soil water balance components. From these measurements, we derived actual evapotranspiration (ET), soil evaporation and transpiration, WUEDM (slope of the regression between dry matter and ET), WUEY (ratio between grain yield and ET), RUE (slope of the regression between dry matter and intercepted radiation), and g(c) (slope of the regression between transpiration and intercepted radiation). Yield increased from 2.3 in unfertilised to an average 4.7 t ha(-1) in fertilised crops, seasonal ET from 311 to 387 mm, WUEDM from 23 to 37 kg ha(-1) mm(-1), WUEY from 7.6 to 12.4 kg ha(-1) mm(-1), RUE from 0.85 to 1.07 g MJ(-1), while the fraction of ET accounted for soil evaporation decreased from 0.20 to 0.11. In agreement with our hypothesis, RUE accounted for 60% of the variation in WUEDM, whereas crop conductance was largely unaffected by nitrogen supply. A greater fraction of evapotranspiration lost as soil evaporation also contributed to the lower WUEDM of unfertilised crops. (C) 2001 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

AB The hyphal growth of some vesicular-arbuscular (VA) mycorrhizal fungi is inhibited by increasing concentrations of NaCl in soil, and this may influence the formation of mycorrhizas. Our objective was to examine the effect of NaCl on the distance that hyphae of a VA mycorrhizal fungus, Gigaspora decipiens Hall and Abbott can grow through soil and infect roots of a known host plant, Trifolium resupinatum. L. cv. Kyambro. An experimental procedure was developed to enable the effect of NaCl on the pre-symbiotic growth of hyphae of a VA mycorrhizal fungus to be studied separately from other phases of the life-cycle. Roots 1 cm from the spores were infected after 15d in soils moistened with 0 or 75 mM NaCl, indicating that the initial hyphal growth was not inhibited in soil moistened with 75 mM NaCl. With time, hyphal growth became increasingly inhibited by NaCl, as roots 2.5 cm from the spores were not infected after 26 d in soil moistened with 75 mM NaCl, bur were infected in soil without NaCl added. In soil moistened with 150mM NaCl, roots 1cm from the spores were infected after 26 d, but roots 2 cm from the spores were not infected after 36 d. Increasing concentrations of NaCl inhibited either the hyphal growth or the infectivity of G. decipiens hyphae after they had grown through soil. The latter may be unlikely, because the infectivity of G. decipiens hyphae placed directly onto the roots was not affected by NaCl. Increasing concentrations of NaCl also inhibited the spread of infection after the initial infection had occurred, and this is probably due to NaCl in the soil inhibiting hyphal growth as well as possibly affecting the supply of carbohydrates from the plant to the fungus.

ID CONSERVATION; KNOWLEDGE
AB Ancient conceptualizations of ecosystems exist in several Amerindian, Asia-Pacific, European, and African cultures. The rediscovery by scientists of ecosystem-like concepts among traditional peoples has been important in the appreciation of traditional ecological knowledge among ecologists, anthropologists, and interdisciplinary scholars. Two key characteristics of these systems are that (a) the unit of nature is often defined in terms of a geographical boundary, such as a watershed, and (b) abiotic components, plants, animals, and humans within this unit are considered to be interlinked. Many traditional ecological knowledge systems are compatible with the emerging view of ecosystems as unpredictable and uncontrollable, and of ecosystem processes as nonlinear, multiequilibrium, and full of surprises. Traditional knowledge may complement scientific knowledge by providing practical experience in living within ecosystems and responding to ecosystem change. However, the "language" of traditional ecology is different from the scientific and usually includes metaphorical imagery and spiritual expression, signifying differences in context, motive, and conceptual underpinnings.

AB 1. Parameters of the photosynthesis vs CO2 response curve, nitrogen and chlorophyll contents were studied in Populus tremula, Tilia cordata and Corylus avellana leaves along a natural light gradient in the canopy.
   2. In all species, leaf nitrogen content per unit area (N-s) declined with decreasing fractional transmission of photon flux density (K-sum), measured by a hemispheric photographic technique. However, the shape of the relationship between N-s and K-sum depended on species. N-s was almost linearly related to K-sum in the most light-demanding species P. tremula but this relationship was curved in two other species. Populus tremula possessed the largest values of N-s at given K-sum, while C. avallana, the most shade-tolerant species, had the lowest values of N-s.
   3. Both the initial slope, characterizing the maximum carboxylation efficiency, and the plateau value, providing an estimate of the photosynthetic electron transport capacity, of the photosynthesis vs CO2 response curves, were linearly related to N-s and only minor differences were observed among the studied species. Leaf chlorophyll content per area was also related to N-s but the ratio of Chl/N increased substantially at low K-sum in the lower canopy. It was concluded that the partitioning of nitrogen between light harvesting, electron transport and carboxylation components of the photosynthetic apparatus may change with depth in the canopy as a result of a relative increase in the light-harvesting complexes in relation to the rest of the photosynthetic apparatus.
   4. The interspecific differences in species' photosynthetic potentials are mainly associated with different nitrogen distribution patterns along the canopy and in minor part with differences in nitrogen partitioning among photosynthetic machinery.

AB Specific leaf area (the ratio of leaf area to leaf dry mass) and leaf nitrogen concentration were measured on ten annual and nine perennial grass species growing in two old-fields of southern France, under a sub-humid Mediterranean climate. Specific leaf area (SLA) was found to be significantly higher in annuals than in perennials, but leaf nitrogen concentration expressed on a dry mass basis (LNCm) was similar in both life-forms; expressed on an area basis, leaf nitrogen concentration (LNCa) was significantly higher in perennials. The correlation between SLA and LNCm was negative in annuals and positive in perennials, while that between the inverse of specific leaf area (1/SLA) and LNCa was positive in annuals and not significant in perennials. It is hypothesized that these contrasting patterns depend on whether the two components of SLA - leaf thickness and density - vary in opposite directions. For nine of the species studied (six annuals and three perennials). relative growth rate data obtained in the laboratory under non-limiting nutrient supply were available; positive correlations were found between these values and both SLA and LNCm obtained in the field, suggesting that the interspecific differences in structural and chemical characteristics of leaves are maintained under a wide range of growing conditions.

AB Small herbivorous mammals living in successional patchy environments may be affected by both patch size variations and successional changes. If patch size affects densities of residents then larger patches should have higher densities compared to smaller patches because larger patches often have greater habitat diversity and lesser chances of stochastic events destroying the population. If patch size affects length of time animals spend on patches (persistence rates) then smaller patches should have lower persistence rates compared to larger patches because smaller patches contain fewer resources. Larger animals may be constrained by body size, as well as population size, to reside only on the larger patches because smaller patches do not contain enough resources. If successional changes affect resident animals that are host specific on colonizing plant species, then the effects may be noticeable immediately following field abandonment because plant species replacement rates are most rapid then.
   Four small mammal species were included:  Sigmodon hispidus, Reithrodontomys megalotis, Microtus ochrogaster, and Peromyscus maniculatus. The field was divided into patches that varied in area by two orders of magnitude with patches of each size treatment placed in each section of the field. Patch size effects on densities and persistence rates of the four mammal species were tested with analyses of variance. Plant species were grouped according to seven life history traits so as to include relative percent cover of most plant species. Multiple linear regression analyses were used to identify which variables (patch size, field sections, and percent relative cover) significantly explained variations in small mammal densities.
   Effects of patch size on animal densities and persistence rates varied among animal species. The largest species, Sigmodon hispidus, was never found on the smallest patches, but densities of Reithrodontomys megalotis, Microtus ochrogaster, and Peromyscus maniculatus were often highest on the smallest patches. Animal density variations were often significantly explained by patch size using multiple regression analyses (P less-than-or-equal-to .001). However, lack of consistent trends with respect to the other independent variables included in the equations and variable R2 values suggested that other, unmeasured, variables may have influenced the results. Persistence rates of the three species were often highest on the largest patches. Results suggested that animals visited small patches more often than large patches without staying, and used large patches to create territories. Small and medium patches may have been used as archipelagos of preferred habitat interspersed with less desirable habitat.
   The first stage of old-field succession was completed by the end of the 3rd yr:  perennials replaced annuals as the dominant plant species. Neither patch size nor field sections significantly affected percent cover.

AB While the application of machine-learning algorithms has been highly simplified in the last years due to their well-documented integration in commonly used statistical programming languages (such as R or Python), there are several practical challenges in the field of ecological modeling related to unbiased performance estimation. One is the influence of spatial autocorrelation in both hyperparameter tuning and performance estimation. Grouped cross-validation strategies have been proposed in recent years in environmental as well as medical contexts to reduce bias in predictive performance. In this study we show the effects of spatial autocorrelation on hyperparameter tuning and performance estimation by comparing several widely used machine-learning algorithms such as boosted regression trees (BRT), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM) with traditional parametric algorithms such as logistic regression (GLM) and semi-parametric ones like generalized additive models (GAM) in terms of predictive performance. Spatial and non-spatial cross-validation methods were used to evaluate model performances aiming to obtain bias-reduced performance estimates. A detailed analysis on the sensitivity of hyperparameter tuning when using different resampling methods (spatial/non-spatial) was performed. As a case study the spatial distribution of forest disease (Diplodia sapinea) in the Basque Country (Spain) was investigated using common environmental variables such as temperature, precipitation, soil and lithology as predictors. Random Forest (mean Brier score estimate of 0.166) outperformed all other methods with regard to predictive accuracy. Though the sensitivity to hyperparameter tuning differed between the ML algorithms, there were in most cases no substantial differences between spatial and non-spatial partitioning for hyperparameter tuning. However, spatial hyperparameter tuning maintains consistency with spatial estimation of classifier performance and should be favored over non-spatial hyperparameter optimization. High performance differences (up to 47%) between the bias-reduced (spatial crossvalidation) and overoptimistic (non-spatial cross-validation) cross-validation settings showed the high need to account for the influence of spatial autocorrelation. Overoptimistic performance estimates may lead to false actions in ecological decision making based on biased model predictions.

AB Land use/land cover and its change is a certain reflection of the interaction of natural factors and human activity in regional ecological environment, and the change of land use/land cover also affects the regional ecological process. Among regional ecological assessments, the landscape ecological risk assessment by land use/land cover changes is a regional ecological risk assessment method that is based on spatial pattern perspectives. The research on typical ecological fragile areas that respond strongly to global change focuses on coastal zones, wetlands and transition zones between cropping areas and nomadic areas; however, there are no related studies on the Tibetan Plateau. This study proposed an ecological risk assessment on Delingha City on the Tibetan plateau by using RS (remote sensing) and GIS (geographic information system) methods Based on land use/land cover variations in Delingha City during the periods 1986-2000 and 2000-2015, regional ecological risk changes were analysed to provide scientific bases for the ecological protection of cities on the Tibetan Plateau. The results indicated that: 1) From 1986 to 2000, major land use/land cover changes took place in the south of the city; in general, grassland was converted into farmland. From 2000 to 2015, the spatial distribution of land use changes was chaotic; however, the land use changes in the south were more concentrated and significant. 2) More than half of Delingha City fall under low ecological risk zones, which are mainly located in high-altitude mountainous area in north Delingha. High ecological risk areas are mainly located in the low-lying and flat landscapes in the south. 3) During the research period, the significant decrease of highest-and high-risk zones and considerable increase of low-risk zone indicate an improvement of the overall ecological environment in Delingha City through 1986-2015.

AB AimUnderstanding the relative importance of climatic and non-climatic distribution drivers for co-occurring, functionally similar species is required to assess potential consequences of climate change. This understanding is, however, lacking for most ecosystems. We address this knowledge gap and forecast changes in distribution for habitat-forming seaweeds in one of the world's most species-rich temperate reef ecosystems.
   LocationThe Great Southern Reef. The full extent of Australia's temperate coastline.
   MethodsWe assessed relationships between climatic and non-climatic environmental data known to influence seaweed, and the presence of 15 habitat-forming seaweeds. Distributional data (herbarium records) were analysed with MAXENT and generalized linear and additive models, to construct species distribution models at 0.2 degrees spatial resolution, and project possible distribution shifts under the RCP 6.0 (medium) and 2.6 (conservative) emissions scenarios of ocean warming for 2100.
   ResultsSummer temperatures, and to a lesser extent winter temperatures, were the strongest distribution predictors for temperate habitat-forming seaweeds in Australia. Projections for 2100 predicted major poleward shifts for 13 of the 15 species, on average losing 78% (range: 36%-100%) of their current distributions under RCP 6.0 and 62% (range: 27%-100%) under RCP 2.6. The giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera) and three prominent fucoids (Durvillaea potatorum, Xiphophora chondrophylla and Phyllospora comosa) were predicted to become extinct from Australia under RCP 6.0. Many species currently distributed up the west and east coasts, including the dominant kelp Ecklonia radiata (71% and 49% estimated loss for RPC 6.0 and 2.6, respectively), were predicted to become restricted to the south coast.
   Main conclusionsIn close accordance with emerging observations in Australia and globally, our study predicted major range contractions of temperate seaweeds in coming decades. These changes will likely have significant impacts on marine biodiversity and ecosystem functioning because large seaweeds are foundation species for 100s of habitat-associated plants and animals, many of which are socio-economically important and endemic to southern Australia.

AB Intense demand for water in the Central Valley of California and related increases in groundwater nitrate concentration threaten the sustainability of the groundwater resource. To assess contamination risk in the region, we developed a hybrid, non-linear, machine learningmodel within a statistical learning framework to predict nitrate contamination of groundwater to depths of approximately 500 m below ground surface. A database of 145 predictor variables representing well characteristics, historical and current field and landscape-scale nitrogen mass balances, historical and current land use, oxidation/reduction conditions, groundwater flow, climate, soil characteristics, depth to groundwater, and groundwater age were assigned to over 6000 private supply and public supply wells measured previously for nitrate and located throughout the study area. The boosted regression tree (BRT) method was used to screen and rank variables to predict nitrate concentration at the depths of domestic and public well supplies. The novel approach included as predictor variables outputs from existing physically based models of the Central Valley. The top five most important predictor variables included two oxidation/reduction variables (probability of manganese concentration to exceed 50 ppb and probability of dissolved oxygen concentration to be below 0.5 ppm), field-scale adjusted unsaturated zone nitrogen input for the 1975 time period, average difference between precipitation and evapotranspiration during the years 1971-2000, and 1992 total landscape nitrogen input. Twenty-five variables were selected for the final model for log-transformed nitrate. In general, increasing probability of anoxic conditions and increasing precipitation relative to potential evapotranspiration had a corresponding decrease in nitrate concentration predictions. Conversely, increasing 1975 unsaturated zone nitrogen leaching flux and 1992 total landscape nitrogen input had an increasing relative impact on nitrate predictions. Three-dimensional visualization indicates that nitrate predictions depend on the probability of anoxic conditions and other factors, and that nitrate predictions generally decreased with increasing groundwater age.

AB Global sustainability policies, such as the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) or the Aichi Targets, aim to ensure sustainable development, including improved human well-being and the conservation of nature. Although not yet explicitly used to evaluate the progress towards sustainable development, the ecosystem service concept implies a direct link between biodiversity and human well-being. This study explores how and which ecosystem services are currently considered in the SDGs and the Aichi Targets. We also identify which information might be already available for monitoring the progress towards their goals by reviewing national ecosystem assessments. This allows the identification of the main knowledge gaps for monitoring progress towards these global sustainability targets.
   There is a wealth of information on all major ecosystem services categories which is directly relevant for the Aichi Targets and the SDGs. The top 25% most cited ecosystem services across both policy documents are: Natural heritage and diversity, Capture fisheries, Aquaculture, Water purification, Crops, Cultural heritage & diversity and Livestock. Most monitoring information recommended for the global sustainability goals, as well as in the information available from national assessments, is biased towards supply related aspects of ecosystem services flows. In contrast, there is much less information on social behaviour, use, demand and governance measures. Indicators are rarely available for all aspects of a specific ecosystem service.
   The national statistical bureaus currently in charge of providing observations for reporting on SDGs, could be well placed to address this bias, by integrating ecological observations with socio-economic statistics into socioecological indicators for ecosystem services flows. IPBES can potentially address the gaps identified in this paper by improving coverage of the different dimensions of ecosystem services flows.

AB 1. Climate models predict that the frequency, intensity and duration of drought events will increase in tropical regions. Although water withdrawal from deep soil layers is generally considered to be an efficient adaptation to drought, there is little information on the role played by deep roots in tropical forests. Tropical Eucalyptus plantations managed in short rotation cycles are simple forest ecosystems that may provide an insight into the water use by trees in tropical forests.
   2. The contribution made by water withdrawn from deep soil layers to the water required for evapotranspiration was quantified daily from planting to harvesting age for a Eucalyptus grandis stand using a soil water transfer model coupled with an ecophysiological forest model (MAESPA). The model was parameterized using an extensive data set and validated using time series of the soil water content down to a depth of 10 m and water-table level, as well as evapotranspiration measured using eddy covariance.
   3. Fast root growth after planting provided access to large quantities of water stored in deep soil layers over the first 2 years. Eucalyptus roots reached the water-table at a depth of 12 m after 2 years. Although the mean water withdrawal from depths of over 10 m amounted to only 5% of canopy transpiration from planting to a harvesting age of 5 years, the proportion of water taken up near the water-table was much higher during dry periods. The water-table rose from 18 to 12 m below-ground over 2 years after the harvest of the previous stand and then fell until harvesting age as evapotranspiration rates exceeded the annual rainfall.
   4. Deep rooting is an efficient strategy to increase the amount of water available for the trees, allowing the uptake of transient gravitational water and possibly giving access to a deep watertable. Deep soil layers have an important buffer role for large amounts of water stored during the wet season that is taken up by trees during dry periods. Our study confirms that deep rooting could be a major mechanism explaining high transpiration rates throughout the year in many tropical forests.

AB In this study, an ecological vulnerability assessment indicator system was constructed using the "exposure-climate sensitivity-adaptive capacity" framework according to the theory of ecological vulnerability. An improved ecosystem service value calculation model was proposed based on empirical parameters. Using Yancheng Nature Reserve in China as an example, we employed remote sensing data to conduct an empirical analysis of the changes in the spatiotemporal pattern, ecological vulnerability, and ecosystem services of typical landscape types over the period from 1987 to 2013. The statistical results derived from landscape pattern indices (LPIs) showed that during the investigation period, three natural wetland landscape types (i.e., Spartina alterniflora, Suaeda glauca, and Phragmites australis) showed gradually increased fragmentation in the study area. The ecological vulnerability scores of the major landscape types (in descending order) were P. australis (0.053), farmland (0.047), S. alterniflora (0.042), S. glauca (0.031), and bare mud flat (0.002). The results derived from the ecosystem service value fluctuation index (ESVFI) showed that from 1987 to 1997, the value of the ecosystem services provided by S. glauca and P. australis wetlands decreased, whereas that of S. alterniflora wetlands increased continuously. From 2002 to 2013, the value of the ecosystem services provided by all three types of natural wetland showed a downward trend. In conclusion, the combined effects of human and natural factors, including the expansion of farmland and the invasion of S. alterniflora, and changes in seawater erosion and deposition led to changes in the landscape patterns, ecological vulnerability, and ecosystem services of the Yancheng Nature Reserve during the investigation period. The results indicate that a "dual adaptive" management system based on natural succession and supplemented by appropriate manual intervention should be implemented, and the management efficiency and flexibility should be improved to meet the common needs of biodiversity conservation and economic development.

AB Landscapes, provide an array of services to society, from the provision of food and material, to the provision of cultural ecosystem services such as recreation, aesthetics or spirituality. Studies on cultural ecosystem services, however, remain rare and little is known about the spatial localisation of these services. In this study, we adopt and test a framework to identify and map the provision of cultural ecosystem services as perceived by tourists in an Alpine region, i.e. the region of South Tyrol in Italy. A photo-based questionnaire survey is combined with cartographical representations of landscape types to elicit hot and coldspot areas of cultural ecosystem service provision. We statistically test for influences of the land use type and the respondents' socio-demographic background on the tourists' perception of these services. The results show that different spatial patterns emerge for each of the investigated cultural ecosystem services depending on the distribution and extent of the landscape types to which they are related. In particular traditionally managed landscapes, small in extent and mainly scattered over large areas between 1000 and 2200 m a.s.l., are hotspot areas of aesthetic beauty, leisure activities and spirituality. In contrast, intensively managed landscapes, mainly located in the lowland plains of the study site, are considered to be more important for the provision of cultural heritage values. While the results suggest that land use type exerts the strongest influence upon tourists' perception, factors such as the respondents' perceived importance of the services, their gender, cultural background, environmental engagement and experience with the landscape play a significant but subordinate role. We conclude that the spatially explicit information about the provision of cultural ecosystem services can serve as a helpful basis for the design and further implementation of land use policies that acknowledge the high touristic value of traditionally used landscapes in mountain regions.

AB The evolutionary mechanisms generating the tremendous biodiversity of islands have long fascinated evolutionary biologists. Genetic drift and divergent selection are predicted to be strong on islands and both could drive population divergence and speciation. Alternatively, strong genetic drift may preclude adaptation. We conducted a genomic analysis to test the roles of genetic drift and divergent selection in causing genetic differentiation among populations of the island fox (Urocyon littoralis). This species consists of six subspecies, each of which occupies a different California Channel Island. Analysis of 5293 SNP loci generated using Restriction-site Associated DNA (RAD) sequencing found support for genetic drift as the dominant evolutionary mechanism driving population divergence among island fox populations. In particular, populations had exceptionally low genetic variation, small N-e (range = 2.1-89.7; median = 19.4), and significant genetic signatures of bottlenecks. Moreover, islands with the lowest genetic variation (and, by inference, the strongest historical genetic drift) were most genetically differentiated from mainland grey foxes, and vice versa, indicating genetic drift drives genome-wide divergence. Nonetheless, outlier tests identified 3.6-6.6% of loci as high F-ST outliers, suggesting that despite strong genetic drift, divergent selection contributes to population divergence. Patterns of similarity among populations based on high FST outliers mirrored patterns based on morphology, providing additional evidence that outliers reflect adaptive divergence. Extremely low genetic variation and small Ne in some island fox populations, particularly on San Nicolas Island, suggest that they may be vulnerable to fixation of deleterious alleles, decreased fitness and reduced adaptive potential.

AB As part of the development of the 2011 National Land Cover Database (NLCD) tree canopy cover layer, a pilot project was launched to test the use of high-resolution photography coupled with extensive ancillary data to map the distribution of tree canopy cover over four study regions in the conterminous US. Two stochastic modeling techniques, random forests (RF) and stochastic gradient boosting (SGB), are compared. The objectives of this study were first to explore the sensitivity of RF and SGB to choices in tuning parameters and, second, to compare the performance of the two final models by assessing the importance of, and interaction between, predictor variables, the global accuracy metrics derived from an independent test set, as well as the visual quality of the resultant maps of tree canopy cover. The predictive accuracy of RF and SGB was remarkably similar on all four of our pilot regions. In all four study regions, the independent test set mean squared error (MSE) was identical to three decimal places, with the largest difference in Kansas where RF gave an MSE of 0.0113 and SGB gave an MSE of 0.0117. With correlated predictor variables, SGB had a tendency to concentrate variable importance in fewer variables, whereas RF tended to spread importance among more variables. RF is simpler to implement than SGB, as RF has fewer parameters needing tuning and also was less sensitive to these parameters. As stochastic techniques, both RF and SGB introduce a new component of uncertainty: repeated model runs will potentially result in different final predictions. We demonstrate how RF allows the production of a spatially explicit map of this stochastic uncertainty of the final model.

AB Both gene-tree discordance and unrecognized diversity are sources of error for accurate estimation of species trees, and can affect downstream diversification analyses by obscuring the correct number of nodes, their density, and the lengths of the branches subtending them. Although the theoretical impact of gene-tree discordance on evolutionary analyses has been examined previously, the effect of unsampled and cryptic diversity has not. Here, we examine how delimitation of previously unrecognized diversity in the milksnake (Lampropeltis triangulum) and use of a species-tree approach affects both estimation of the Lampropeltis phylogeny and comparative analyses with respect to the timing of diversification. Coalescent species delimitation indicates that L. triangulum is not monophyletic and that there are multiple species of milksnake, which increases the known species diversity in the genus Lampropeltis by 40. Both genealogical and temporal discordance occurs between gene trees and the species tree, with evidence that mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) introgression is a main factor. This discordance is further manifested in the preferred models of diversification, where the concatenated gene tree strongly supports an early burst of speciation during the Miocene, in contrast to species-tree estimates where diversification follows a birthdeath model and speciation occurs mostly in the Pliocene and Pleistocene. This study highlights the crucial interaction among coalescent-based phylogeography and species delimitation, systematics, and species diversification analyses.

AB Streams and rivers in mediterranean-climate regions (med-rivers) are subjected to sequential, yet contrasting hydrologic disturbances of drying and flooding. Although seasonally predictable, these disturbances can vary in intensity and duration within and among mediterranean-climate regions (med-regions). Consequently, med-rivers differ in the permanence of their aquatic habitats. To persist, species have acquired matched resistance and resilience adaptations. They gain resistance either by enduring the stress or avoiding it. Community recovery (or resilience) is achieved with cessation of hydrologic stress that permits maximization of re-colonization and reproduction. Endurance strategies are usually disturbance-specific, but avoidance enables organisms to cope with both drying and flooding, and is the prevalent resistance strategy. Correspondingly, community persistence depends to a large extent on the integrity of refuges, an aspect that has so far been little explored. Existing information suggests that seasonal community succession becomes more pronounced with increasing aridity and declining water permanence. The invertebrate community in semi-arid med-rivers can therefore undergo succession through three to four identifiable assemblages, whereas in perennial streams the difference between wet and dry period assemblages is smaller. Community turnover is influenced by the intensity of the hydrologic disturbances and varies between wet and drought years.

TI Sense of place as a determinant of people's attitudes towards the

AB Integrating people's values and perceptions into planning is essential for the successful management of natural resources. However, successful implementation of natural resources management decisions on the ground is a complex task, which requires a comprehensive understanding of a system's social and ecological linkages. This paper investigates the relationship between sense of place and people's attitudes towards their natural environment. Sense of place contributes towards shaping peoples' beliefs, values and commitments. Here, we set out to explore how these theoretical contributions can be operationalized for natural resources management planning in the Great Barrier Reef region of Australia. We hypothesise that the region's diverse range of natural resources, conservation values and management pressures might be reflected in people's attachment to place. To tests this proposition, variables capturing socio-demographics, personal wellbeing and a potential for sense of place were collected via mail-out survey of 372 residents of the region, and tested for relationships using multivariate regression and redundancy orientation analyses. Results indicate that place of residence within the region, involvement in community activities, country of birth and the length of time respondents lived in the region are important determinants of the values assigned to factors related to the natural environment. This type of information is readily available from National Census and thus could be incorporated into the planning of community engagement strategies early in the natural resources management planning process. A better understanding of the characteristics that allow sense of place meanings to develop can facilitate a better understanding of people's perceptions towards environmental and biodiversity issues. We suggest that the insights gained from this study can benefit environmental decision making and planning in the Great Barrier Reef region; and that sense of place is a concept worthy of further investigation elsewhere.

AB Understanding large-scale patterns in flow intermittence is important for effective river management. The duration and frequency of zero-flow periods are associated with the ecological characteristics of rivers and have important implications for water resources management. We used daily flow records from 628 gauging stations on rivers with minimally modified flows distributed throughout France to predict regional patterns of flow intermittence. For each station we calculated two annual times series describing flow intermittence; the frequency of zero-flow periods (consecutive days of zero flow) in each year of record (FREQ; yr(-1)), and the total number of zero-flow days in each year of record (DUR; days). These time series were used to calculate two indices for each station, the mean annual frequency of zero-flow periods (mFREQ; yr(-1)), and the mean duration of zero-flow periods (mDUR; days). Approximately 20% of stations had recorded at least one zero-flow period in their record. Dissimilarities between pairs of gauges calculated from the annual times series (FREQ and DUR) and geographic distances were weakly correlated, indicating that there was little spatial synchronization of zero flow. A flow-regime classification for the gauging stations discriminated intermittent and perennial stations, and an intermittence classification grouped intermittent stations into three classes based on the values of mFREQ and mDUR. We used random forest (RF) models to relate the flow-regime and intermittence classifications to several environmental characteristics of the gauging station catchments. The RF model of the flow-regime classification had a cross-validated Cohen's kappa of 0.47, indicating fair performance and the intermittence classification had poor performance (cross-validated Cohen's kappa of 0.35). Both classification models identified significant environment-intermittence associations, in particular with regional-scale climate patterns and also catchment area, shape and slope. However, we suggest that the fair-to-poor performance of the classification models is because intermittence is also controlled by processes operating at scales smaller catchments, such as groundwater-table fluctuations and seepage through permeable channels. We suggest that high spatial heterogeneity in these small-scale processes partly explains the low spatial synchronization of zero flows. While 20% of gauges were classified as intermittent, the flow-regime model predicted 39% of all river segments to be intermittent, indicating that the gauging station network under-represents intermittent river segments in France. Predictions of regional patterns in flow intermittence provide useful information for applications including environmental flow setting, estimating assimilative capacity for contaminants, designing bio-monitoring programs and making preliminary predictions of the effects of climate change on flow intermittence.

AB Data limitations can lead to unrealistic fits of predictive species distribution models (SDMs) and spurious extrapolation to novel environments. Here, we want to draw attention to novel combinations of environmental predictors that are within the sampled range of individual predictors but are nevertheless outside the sample space. These tend to be overlooked when visualizing model behaviour. They may be a cause of differing model transferability and environmental change predictions between methods, a problem described in some studies but generally not well understood. We here use a simple simulated data example to illustrate the problem and provide new and complementary visualization techniques to explore model behaviour and predictions to novel environments. We then apply these in a more complex real-world example. Our results underscore the necessity of scrutinizing model fits, ecological theory and environmental novelty.

AB Aim Understanding which human or environmental factors interact to enable or to limit the occurrence and persistence of large carnivores in human-dominated landscapes is an important issue for their effective conservation, especially under the current scenario of global change where most of their former habitat is being transformed by humans.
   Location NW Iberian Peninsula.
   Methods We combine data on the distribution of Iberian wolves (Canis lupus signatus) living in a human- dominated landscape in NW Spain and variation and partitioning methods to investigate the relative importance of three groups of predictors: food availability, humans and landscape attributes - each group expected to have unequal effects on wolf reproduction and survival - and their interactions on the occurrence of this species.
   Results We found that the group of predictors related with landscape attributes (altitude, roughness and refuge) strongly determined wolf occurrence, followed by humans and food availability. Variance partitioning analysis revealed that the three most important components determining wolf occurrence were related with landscape attributes: (1) the joint effects of the three predictor groups, (2) the joint effect of humans and landscape attributes and (3) the pure effect of landscape attributes. Altitude had the main independent contribution to explain the probability of wolf occurrence.
   Main conclusions In human- dominated landscapes, the occurrence of wolves is the result of a complex interaction among several environmental and human factors. Our results suggest that the characteristics of the landscape (spatial context) - factors associated with the security of wolves facilitating that animals go unnoticed by humans, wolf movements, dispersal events and short- time colonization - become more important in human- dominated landscapes and may have played a key role in the occurrence and persistence of this species throughout decades modulating the relationship between humans and wolf distribution.

AB The high biodiversity of coral reefs is attributable to the many invertebrate groups which live in symbiotic relationships with other reef organisms, particularly those which associate with the living coral habitat. However, few studies have examined the diversity and community structure of coral-dwelling invertebrates and how they vary among coral species. This study quantified the species richness and composition of animals associated with four common species of branching corals (Acropora nasuta, A. millepora, Pocillopora damicornis, and Seriatopora hystrix) at Lizard Island in the northern Great Barrier Reef. One hundred and seventy-eight nominal species from 12 different phyla were extracted across 50 replicate colonies of each coral host. A single coral colony, approximately 20 cm in diameter, harbored as many as 73 individuals and 24 species. There were substantial differences in invertebrate species composition among coral hosts of different families as well as genera. Twenty-seven species (15% of all taxa collected) were found on only one of the four different coral species, which may potentially indicate some level of specialization among coral hosts. The distinct assemblages on different coral species, and the presence of potential specialists, suggests invertebrate communities will be sensitive to the differential loss of branching coral species resulting from coral reef degradation.

AB Molecular markers, such as mitochondrial DNA and microsatellite loci, are widely studied to assess population genetics and phylogeography; however, the selective neutrality of these markers is increasingly being questioned. Given the importance of molecular markers in fisheries science and conservation, we evaluated the neutrality of both mtDNA and microsatellite loci through their associations with population size. We surveyed mtDNA and microsatellite data from the primary literature and determined whether genetic diversity increased with abundance across a total of 105 marine and freshwater fishes, with both global fisheries catch data and body size as proxies for abundance ( with an additional 57 species for which only body size data were assessed). We found that microsatellite data generally yielded higher associations with abundance than mtDNA data, and within mtDNA analyses, number of haplotypes and haplotype diversity were more strongly associated with abundance than nucleotide diversity, particularly for freshwater fishes. We compared genetic diversity between freshwater and marine fishes and found that marine fishes had higher values of all measures of genetic diversity than freshwater fishes. Results for both mtDNA and microsatellites generally conformed to neutral expectations, although weaker relationships were often found between mtDNA nucleotide diversity and 'abundance' compared to any other genetic statistic. We speculate that this is because of historical events unrelated to natural selection, although a role for selection cannot be ruled out.

AB To increase ecosystem services provided by their lands, farmers in the United States are managing non-production areas to create a more biodiverse set of habitats and greater landscape heterogeneity. Relatively little is known, however, of the actual environmental outcomes of this practice, termed 'farmscaping'. We inventoried communities of plant and soil organisms and monitored indicators of ecosystem functions in six distinct habitats of an organic farm in California's Central Valley to better understand the ecological costs and benefits of farmscaping. A riparian corridor, hedgerows, a system of drainage ditches, and tailwater ponds supported different plant life history/functional groups and greater native plant diversity than the two production fields. Differences were less pronounced for belowground organisms, i.e., nematode functional groups, microbial communities (based on phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis) and earthworm taxa. Partial ordination analysis showed that environmental variables, rather than spatial location, explained much of the distribution of soil and plant taxa across the farmscape. Riparian and hedgerow habitats with woody vegetation stored 18% of the farmscape's total carbon (C), despite occupying only 6% of the total area. Infiltration rates in the riparian corridor were >230% higher than those observed in the production fields, and concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in soil solution were as much as 65% higher. The tailwater pond reduced total suspended solids in irrigation runoff by 97%. Drainage ditches had the highest N2O-N emissions (mean values of 16.7 mu g m(-2) h(-1)) and nitrate (NO3--N) leaching (12.1 g m(-2) year(-1) at 75 cm depth). Emissions of N2O-N and leaching of NO3--N were, however, quite low for all the habitats. Non-production habitats increased biodiversity (particularly plants) and specific ecosystem functions (e.g. water regulation and carbon storage). Extrapolating relative tradeoffs to the entire farmscape showed that greater habitat enhancement through farmscaping could increase both biodiversity and multiple ecosystem functions of agricultural lands with minor loss of production area.

AB Aim
   Three common patterns have emerged in comparative phylogeographic analyses at many barriers: (1) a potential geographic pseudocongruence of lineage divergences; (2) a disconnect between the inference of temporally clustered, relatively recent timing for observed speciation events, and dates spanning a broader, apparently random time-scale; and (3) an apparent prevalence of speciation with recent or continuing gene flow. It is unclear if there is a unifying explanation for these phenomena. We argue that the interaction between geographic barriers to dispersal and ecological limits on the distribution of species can explain these patterns. We suggest that these patterns can be explained by the presence of a continuum between two underlying processes, here termed 'hard' and 'soft' allopatric divergence, which result from the interplay between organismal ecology and the physioecological nature of geographic barriers.
   Location
   Examples from North America.
   Methods
   We examine comparative phylogeographic divergences in 18 groups of terrestrial vertebrates at two major biogeographic features in North America - the Mississippi River Embayment and the Cochise Filter Barrier - to test predictions made by this hypothesis.
   Results
   We find support for the two distinct processes of hard and soft allopatry, and note several examples exhibiting characteristics of both. Hard allopatry is caused by physical barriers promoting divergence as a function of consistent geographic isolation. Soft allopatry is caused by ecological processes that isolate populations geographically in allopatric refugia through niche conservatism, or across ecological transition zones through niche divergence, but which may be periodic or inconsistent through time.
   Main conclusions
   Viewing geographic speciation as a continuum between hard and soft allopatry can explain all three patterns as a consequence of the physical and ecological mechanisms that isolate populations, and provides an alternative perspective on the impact of ecological factors and physical barriers on lineage formation.

AB We analyze the phylogeny of the medically important and taxonomically unresolved viper genus Echis using four mitochondrial gene fragments. The results show that the populations of the genus fall into four main clades: the Echis carinatus, E. coloratus, E. ocellatus and E. pyramidum groups. The E pyramidum and E. coloratus groups are sister taxa but the interrelationships of this clade and the E ocellatus and E carinatus groups are unresolved. The initial divergence of the genus appears to coincide with the collision between Afro-Arabia and Eurasia, and that between the E. coloratus and E. pyramidum clades appears to be associated with the opening of the Red Sea. Later land connections between Africa and Arabia may have contributed to shaping the distribution of the E pyramidum complex. The present distribution of E carinatus may be the result of range expansion from southern India. Taxonomically, our results provide molecular evidence for the validity of Echis omanensis, E. khosatzkii, E. borkini and E. jogeri, for the presence of unsuspected genetic diversity within the E pyramidum complex in eastern Africa, and for the conspecificity of E. carinatus and E. multisquamatus. The status of E. leucogaster remains to be confirmed. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Aim To investigate the potential impacts of climate change on stream fish assemblages in terms of species and biological trait diversity, composition and similarity.
   Location One-thousand one-hundred and ten stream sections in France.
   Methods We predicted the future potential distribution of 35 common stream fish species facing changes in temperature and precipitation regime. Seven different species distribution models were applied and a consensus forecast was produced to limit uncertainty between single-models. The potential impacts of climate change on fish assemblages were assessed using both species and biological trait approaches. We then addressed the spatial distribution of potential impacts along the upstream-downstream gradient.
   Results Overall, climate change was predicted to result in an increase in species and trait diversity. Species and trait composition of the fish assemblages were also projected to be highly modified. Changes in assemblages' diversity and composition differed strongly along the upstream-downstream gradient, with upstream and midstream assemblages more modified than downstream assemblages. We also predicted a global increase in species and trait similarity between pairwise assemblages indicating a future species and trait homogenization of fish assemblages. Nevertheless, we found that upstream assemblages would differentiate, whereas midstream and downstream assemblages would homogenize. Our results suggested that colonization could be the main driver of the predicted homogenization, while local extinctions could result in assemblage differentiation.
   Main conclusions This study demonstrated that climate change could lead to contrasted impacts on fish assemblage structure and diversity depending on the position along the upstream-downstream gradient. These results could have important implications in terms of ecosystem monitoring as they could be useful in establishing areas that would need conservation prioritization.

AB California coast live oak ( Quercus agrifolia) forms tripartite symbiotic associations with arbuscular (AMF) and ectomycorrhizal (EMF) fungi. We selected oak individuals differing in topographic position and depth to groundwater ( mesicvalley vs. xeric hill sites) to investigate changes of tree mycorrhizal status in response to interannual rainfall variability. EMF root colonization, as well as hyphal abundance and viability in upper rhizosphere soil (0-30 cm), were negatively affected by severe multi-year drought, although not to the same extent in each topographic location. Oak trees growing in hill sites showed EMF colonization levels, < 1% in upper roots during drought. By contrast, oaks in valley sites maintained much higher EMF colonization (> 19%) in upper roots during drought. EMF root colonization increased sharply at both topographic positions during the ensuing wet year (78% in valley, 49% in hill), which indicates that the mycorrhizal status of roots in upper rhizosphere soil is highly responsive to interannual rainfall variability. Across sites and years, percentage EMF colonization and soil hyphal density and viability were strongly positively correlated with soil moisture potential, but percentage AMF root colonization was not. Interestingly, changes in percentage EMF root colonization and density of viable hyphae between a wet and a dry year were proportionally much greater in xeric hill sites than in mesic valley sites. The mycorrhizal status of oak trees was particularly responsive to changes in soil moisture at the hill sites, where roots in upper rhizosphere soil shifted from almost exclusively AMF during severe drought to predominantly EMF during the ensuing wet year. By contrast, the mycorrhizal status of oaks in the valley sites was less strongly coupled to current meteorological conditions, as roots in upper soil layers remained predominantly EMF during both a dry and a wet year. Canopy shading and hydraulic lift by oaks in valley sites likely contributed to maintain the integrity and viability of EMF roots and extraradical hyphae in upper rhizosphere soil during extended drought. Our results suggest that oak woodlands in water-limited ecosystems may become increasingly reliant on the AMF symbiosis under future climate change scenarios for the U. S. southwest and other world regions.

AB Understanding the factors determining the transition from introduction of aliens to the establishment of invasive populations is a critical issue of the study of biological invasions, and has key implications for management. Differences in fitness among areas of introduction can define the zones where aliens become invasive. The American slider turtle Trachemys scripta has been introduced worldwide, and has negative effects on freshwater communities, but only a subset of introduced populations breed successfully. We used species distribution models to assess the factors influencing the slider distribution in Italy, by analysing bioclimatic features that can cause the transition from presence of feral adults to breeding populations. We also evaluated whether climate change might increase the future suitability for reproduction.
   Central and Northern Italy.
   The distribution of slider turtle was obtained from the literature, unpublished reports and field surveys. We used Maxent to build bioclimatic models.
   Reproductive populations are associated to a clear bioclimatic envelope with warmer climate, more solar radiation and higher precipitations than populations where reproduction is not observed. Several Mediterranean areas currently have climatic features suitable for sliders. Scenarios of climate change predict the expansion of these areas. In the near future (2020), the proportion of populations in areas suitable for reproduction will dramatically increase.
   Our study shows that bioclimatic differences can determine the areas where aliens become invaders. Management should be focused to these source areas. However, climate change can increase fitness in the future, and therefore the interactions between climate change and fitness can boost the invasiveness of this alien species.

ID PLANT-COMMUNITIES; DISTRIBUTIONS; IMPACTS
AB Pioneering efforts to predict shifts in species distribution under climate change used simple models based on the correlation between contemporary environmental factors and distributions. These models make predictions at coarse spatial scales and assume the constancy of present correlations between environment and distribution. Adaptive management of climate change impacts requires models that can make more robust predictions at finer spatio-temporal scales by accounting for processes that actually affect species distribution on heterogeneous landscapes. Mechanistic models of the distribution of both species and vegetation types have begun to emerge to meet these needs. We review these developments and highlight how recent advances in our understanding of relationships among the niche concept, species diversity and community assembly point the way towards more effective models for the impacts of global change on species distribution and community diversity.

AB Aim A central question in evolutionary ecology is the nature of environmental barriers that can limit gene flow and induce population genetic divergence, a first step towards speciation. Here we study the geographical barrier constituted by the transition zone between the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea, using as our model Cymodocea nodosa, a seagrass distributed throughout the Mediterranean and in the Atlantic, from central Portugal to Mauritania. We also test predictions about the genetic footprints of Pleistocene glaciations.
   Location The Atlantic-Mediterranean transition region and adjacent areas in the Atlantic (Mauritania to south-west Portugal) and the Mediterranean.
   Methods We used eight microsatellite markers to compare 20 seagrass meadows in the Atlantic and 27 meadows in the Mediterranean, focusing on the transition between these basins.
   Results Populations from these two regions form coherent groups containing several unique, high-frequency alleles for the Atlantic and for the Mediterranean, with some admixture west of the Almeria-Oran Front (Portugal, south-west Spain and Morocco). These are populations where only one or a few genotypes were found, for all but Cadiz, but remarkably still show the footprint of a contact zone. This extremely low genotypic richness at the Atlantic northern edge contrasts with the high values (low clonality) at the Atlantic southern edge and in most of the Mediterranean. The most divergent populations are those at the higher temperature range limits: the southernmost Atlantic populations and the easternmost Mediterranean, both potential footprints of vicariance.
   Main conclusions A biogeographical transition region occurs close to the Almeria-Oran front. A secondary contact zone in Atlantic Iberia and Morocco results from two distinct dispersal sources: the Mediterranean and southernmost Atlantic populations, possibly during warmer interglacial or post-glacial periods. The presence of high-frequency diagnostic alleles in present-day disjunct populations from the southernmost Atlantic region indicates that their separation from all remaining populations is ancient, and suggests an old, stable rear edge.

TI A Comparison of Phylogenetic Network Methods Using Computer Simulation
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
AB Background: We present a series of simulation studies that explore the relative performance of several phylogenetic network approaches (statistical parsimony, split decomposition, union of maximum parsimony trees, neighbor-net, simulated history recombination upper bound, median-joining, reduced median joining and minimum spanning network) compared to standard tree approaches, (neighbor-joining and maximum parsimony) in the presence and absence of recombination.
   Principal Findings: In the absence of recombination, all methods recovered the correct topology and branch lengths nearly all of the time when the substitution rate was low, except for minimum spanning networks, which did considerably worse. At a higher substitution rate, maximum parsimony and union of maximum parsimony trees were the most accurate. With recombination, the ability to infer the correct topology was halved for all methods and no method could accurately estimate branch lengths.
   Conclusions: Our results highlight the need for more accurate phylogenetic network methods and the importance of detecting and accounting for recombination in phylogenetic studies. Furthermore, we provide useful information for choosing a network algorithm and a framework in which to evaluate improvements to existing methods and novel algorithms developed in the future.

AB Although females are expected to maximize their reproductive success with only one or a few matings [1], the females of many species mate with multiple partners [2]. Experimental studies have found evidence for an increase in egg or embryo viability when females mate polyandrously [3]. These studies have been interpreted in the context of genetic-benefit models that propose that multiple mating increases offspring viability because it allows females to select male genotypes that influence viability directly or because it allows females to avoid genetic incompatibility [2, 4-8]. However, no studies have examined directly the precise mechanisms by which parents influence embryo viability. Using a morphological marker that enabled us to determine paternity and survival of embryos sired by individual male crickets in both sperm-competitive and -noncompetitive situations, we show that males inducing high embryo viability enhance the viability of embryos sired by inferior males. These results indicate that paternal effects and interacting phenotypes determine embryo viability. They show that a male's reproductive success is modified by the interaction between indirect genetic effects of sperm competitors. Importantly, our findings show that the benefits accruing to offspring of multiply mated females need not be transmitted genetically.

AB The Ranunculus cassubicus complex, comprising diploids and polyploids, is a good model for studying the role of hybridization and polyploidy in the origin of apomixis.
   Results from amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) and simple sequence repeat (SSR) analyses performed on 448 individuals were combined with evidence from morphology, isozymes, karyology and distribution.
   Our results indicated a unique hybrid origin for the apomictic hexaploid R. carpaticola from north-western Slovakia, involving two sexual parents: autotetraploid R. cassubicifolius from the northern pre-Alps, and diploid R. carpaticola from central Slovakia. The hybrids were intermediate to the parents, but unique alleles have resulted from genomic reorganisation in the allopolyploids, which might also have triggered apomixis. Their distribution patterns and estimated ages suggest that hybridization may be correlated with the last glacial period.
   Hybridization seems to be the major origination for apomicts in the R. cassubicus complex. Polyploidy creates novel sexual genotypes and acts as a springboard for the production of new hybrids, but it only results in a combination with hybridization in apomixis. In turn, asexuality has permitted the perpetuation and establishment of ecologically divergent hybrid genotypes.

AB We examined data on bird and reptile assemblages in a plantation landscape in southern New South Wales, south-eastern Australia, for evidence of threshold responses to the amount of native eucalypt vegetation in circular areas of 2000 and/or 1000 m around field survey sites. These circular areas contained varying proportions of native Eucalyptus and exotic radiata pine Pinus radiata forest thereby providing a basis for examining potential threshold effects in relation to the area of native vegetation cover. For bird species richness or the probability of detection of individual bird species we found no empirical evidence of a threshold response to the area of native vegetation cover, or any other potential explanatory variables. All relationships were characterised by considerable variability in the response data. "Broken-stick" relationships which involved sudden change points did not fit the response data better than smooth relationships obtained from generalised additive or linear models. As with birds, there was no evidence that a threshold model between lizard richness and the amount of native vegetation within 1000m described the relationship any better than a smooth, continuous or other type of relationship. Several related factors may explain our results. An important one is that species-specific responses to landscape conditions mean that marked thresholds will not be seen for an aggregate measure like species richness at a given value for a given landscape variable. Another is that factors other than the amount of native vegetation may significantly influence underlying patterns of species occurrence. This highlights a need to be aware of the potential effects of various ecological processes, even when a substantial amount of native vegetation cover remains.
   Our findings do not rule out the possibility of the existence of threshold relationships. However, irrespective of the choice of measure of predictor variable (e.g., the amount of native vegetation cover), it will often be difficult to detect and estimate threshold responses due to high inherent variability - a characteristic of the vast majority of ecological datasets. Furthermore, even if it is possible to estimate functional (threshold) forms and although they might be useful from an explanatory perspective, in most instances they are likely to be of limited value in a predictive sense. This calls into question the practical significance of the threshold concept. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB 1. We used stream fish and decapod spatial occurrence data extracted from a national database and recent surveys with geospatial landuse data, geomorphologic, climatic, and spatial data in a geographical information system (GIS) to model fish and decapod occurrence in the Wellington Region, New Zealand.
   2. To predict the occurrence of each species at a site from a common set of predictor variables we used a multi-response, artificial neural network (ANN), to produce a single model that predicted the entire fish and decapod assemblage in one procedure.
   3. The predictions from the ANN using this landscape scale data proved very accurate based on evaluation metrics that are independent of species abundance or probability thresholds. The important variables contributing to the predictions included the latitudinal and elevational position of the site reach, catchment area, average air temperature, the vegetation type, landuse proportions of the catchment, and catchment geology.
   4. Geospatial data available for the entire regional river network were then used to create a habitat-suitability map for all 14 species over the regional river network using a GIS. This prediction map has many potential uses including: monitoring and predicting temporal changes in fish communities caused by human activities and shifts in climate, identifying areas in need of protection, biodiversity hotspots, and areas suitable for the reintroduction of endangered or rare species.

AB Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have rarely been exploited in nonhuman and nonmodel organism genetic studies. This is due partly to difficulties in finding SNPs in species where little DNA sequence data exist, as well as to a lack of robust and inexpensive genotyping methods. We have explored one SNP discovery method for molecular ecology, evolution, and conservation studies to evaluate the method and its limitations for population genetics in mammals. We made use of 'CATS' (or 'EPIC') primers to screen for novel SNPs in mammals. Most of these primer sets were designed from primates and/or rodents, for amplifying intron regions from conserved genes. We have screened 202 loci in 16 representatives of the major mammalian clades. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) success correlated with phylogenetic distance from the human and mouse sequences used to design most primers; for example, specific PCR products from primates and the mouse amplified the most consistently and the marsupial and armadillo amplifications were least successful. Approximately 24% (opossum) to 65% (chimpanzee) of primers produced usable PCR product(s) in the mammals tested. Products produced generally high but variable levels of readable sequence and similarity to the expected genes. In a preliminary screen of chimpanzee DNA, 12 SNPs were identified from six (of 11) sequenced regions, yielding a SNP on average every 400 base pairs (bp). Given the progress in genome sequencing, and the large numbers of CATS-like primers published to date, this approach may yield sufficient SNPs per species for population and conservation genetic studies in nonmodel mammals and other organisms.

AB Modular organisms consist of repeated building blocks. An important consequence of modularity may be reflected in the ability of a colony to continually reallocate priority of resource transport among its units in response to stress. Hermatypic corals, the main organisms constructing tropical reefs, are prone to damage by a multitude of agents. Since colonization of lesions by competitors is a potent threat to colonial organisms, fast recovery is an important component of colony survival. Previous regeneration studies have claimed that the energy requirements of this essential process are fueled only by the polyps directly bordering the injured area. This "localized regeneration hypothesis" rejects the necessity for wide colony integration during regeneration and sees no advantage to large colony size. The objective of the present study was to test an alternative regeneration hypothesis that argues, in contrast, that injury repair (i.e., closure of lesions by newly formed tissues) in corals may require extended colony integration (i.e., internal translocation of resources from sites of acquisition to sites of maximal demand). To test our hypothesis we examined: (1) the relationship between colony size and percentage recovery of lesions differing in size and shape; and (2) the effect of different sized lesions on the fecundity of polyps located at increasing distances from the lesion site. Both experiments were conducted on the common, spherically shaped coral Favia favus in the Red Sea near Eilat, Israel. The relatively small lesions (<1 cm(2)) were the only ones to support the localized regeneration hypothesis, since their recovery was unaffected by colony size. However, the two larger lesion types (approximate sizes of 2 cm(2) and 3 cm(2)) confirmed the importance of large colony size for achieving fast recovery. In the second experiment we found that small lesions, repeated monthly, caused only a localized reduction in fecundity, while larger monthly repeated lesions caused significant reductions in fecundity up to a distance of 15 cm away from their site. Both experiments indicate that regeneration from injury may require an extended magnitude of energy integration throughout the colony, and that the extent of this integration is regulated by the colony in accordance with lesion characteristics. It is also concluded that in long-lived organisms such as corals, there is a priority of energy allocation to recovery rather than to reproduction. Our findings reveal the existence of injury thresholds within a colony that determine energy allocation and intra-colonial translocation of energy products toward regions of maximal demand. We suggest that such injury thresholds may characterize many other coral species and that colony integration during stress is a basic life-preserving ability and one of the most important advantages of clonal and colonial organisms.

AB Long-term exposure of plants to elevated partial pressures of CO, (pCO(2)) often depresses photosynthetic capacity. The mechanistic basis for this photosynthetic acclimation may involve accumulation of carbohydrate and may be promoted by nutrient limitation. However, our current knowledge is inadequate for making reliable predictions concerning the onset and extent of acclimation. Many studies have sought to investigate the effects of N supply but the methodologies used generally do not allow separation of the direct effects of limited N availability from those caused by a N dilution effect due to accelerated growth at elevated pCO(2). To dissociate these interactions, wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) was grown hydroponically and N was added in direct proportion to plant growth. Photosynthesis did not acclimate to elevated pCO(2) even when growth was restricted by a low-N relative addition rate. Ribulose-l, 5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase activity and quantity were maintained, there was no evidence for triose phosphate limitation of photosynthesis, and tissue N content remained within the range recorded for healthy wheat plants. In contrast, wheat grown in sand culture with N supplied at a fixed concentration suffered photosynthetic acclimation at elevated pCO(2) in a low-N treatment. This was accompanied by a significant reduction in the quantity of active ribulose-l, 5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase and leaf N content.

AB The population structure of variation in a nuclear actin intron and the control region of mitochondrial DNA is described for humpback whales from eight regions in the North Pacific Ocean: central California, Baja Peninsula, nearshore Mexico (Bahia Banderas), offshore Mexico (Socorro Island), southeastern Alaska, central Alaska (Prince Williams Sound), Hawaii and Japan (Ogasawara Islands). Primary mtDNA haplotypes and intron alleles were identified using selected restriction fragment length polymorphisms of target sequences amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR-RFLP). There was little evidence of heterogeneity in the frequencies of mtDNA haplotypes or actin intron alleles due to the year or sex composition of the sample. However, frequencies of four mtlDNA haplotypes showed marked regional differences in their distributions (Phi(ST) = 0.277; P < 0.001; n = 205 individuals) while the two alleles showed significant, but less marked, regional differences (Phi(ST) = 0.033; P < 0.013; n = 400 chromosomes). An hierarchical analysis of variance in frequencies of haplotypes and alleles supported the grouping of six regions into a central and eastern stock with further partitioning of variance among regions within stocks for haplotypes but not for alleles. Based on available genetic and demographic evidence, the southeastern Alaska and central California feeding grounds were selected for additional analyses of nuclear differentiation using allelic variation at four microsatellite loci. All four loci showed significant differences in allele frequencies (overall F-ST = 0.043; P < 0.001; average n = 139 chromosomes per locus), indicating at least partial reproductive isolation between the two regions as well as the segregation of mtDNA lineages. Although the two feeding grounds were not panmictic for nuclear or mitochondrial loci, estimates of long-term migration rates suggested that male-mediated gene flow was several-fold greater than female gene flow. These results include and extend the range and sample size of previously published work, providing additional evidence for the significance of genetic management units within oceanic populations of humpback whales.

AB Tree species can be split into two groups in terms of their leaf life-spans: evergreens and deciduous. Their distinct geographical distribution suggests that these two groups have functional characteristics adapted to specific environments. However, deciduous and evergreen trees co-exist in some regions, such as those with a Mediterranean climate. They provide good models for comparing the properties of both trees and obtaining an understanding of how diversity is maintained. This is the case in southern France, where the evergreen helm oak (Quercus ilex) and the deciduous downy oak (Quercus pubescens) co-exist. A research programme has been conducted which compares the functioning of these two species at various scales, with the aim of anticipating their distribution in the event of climatic change. The 'cost-benefit' model of Mooney and Dunn has been tested at leaf scale, Q. pubescens has a lower area-based construction cost than Q. ilex, but does not have a higher photosynthetic capacity. Despite differences in biochemical composition, size and mass per unit area, the leaves of the two species respond similarly to limited water conditions. Furthermore, the carbon isotope composition suggests that they have similar intrinsic water-use efficiencies. AL the ecosystem scale, preliminary data are available on water, carbon and nitrogen use: i) measurements of leaf water potentials show that drought constraint starts at the same time and with the same rare and intensity in both species; ii) leaf area index was higher in Q. ilex woodlands; and iii) the release rate of nitrogen from the litter was faster in Q. ilex ecosystems. Together, these results indicate that the key factors distinguishing functions of deciduous and evergreen Quercus are more apparent at the ecosystem level than at the leaf level. (C) Elsevier, Paris.

AB One approach for measuring the length of roots washed from soil samples is to use a desktop scanner to acquire binary images and then use image analysis procedures to determine root length, Normally, this approach requires user-adjusted exposure thresholding. The objectives of this study were to develop a procedure for obtaining binary images of root samples with a desktop scanner that does not require user-adjusted exposure thresholding of each image and to test the performance of the newly developed ROOTEDGE program by using images containing single or multiple root segments of corn (Zea mays L.), ROOTEDGE was developed for measuring the length of digitized roots using the edge chord algorithm, It is insensitive to object orientation, has four image-processing operations, and holds only seven lines of the image in memory. Visual comparisons of digitized images with actual root segments showed that root segments with diameters less than 0.15 mm were not being completely digitized by the image acquisition procedure and were fragmented in the images. The most complete root images were produced by using the highest available scanner resolution and the lowest scanner threshold level for exposure, Using the closing image-processing operation in ROOTEDGE with a test coefficient of 1 also helped to join fragmented objects within images and improved the correlation of ROOTEDGE measurements to direct measurements, Ratios of ROOTEDGE length measurements to manual line-intersection length measurements ranged from 0.98 to 0.88 for four corn root samples of different sizes. In general, the ROOTEDGE software and image acquisition system accurately measured corn root length without user-adjusted exposure thresholding.

AB On many Caribbean fringing coral reefs, two closely related and ecologically similar damselfishes, the beaugregory (Stegastes leucostictus Muller and Troschel) and the cocoa damselfish (S. variabilis Castelnau), occupy nonoverlapping vertical distributions. In St. Croix (USVI), beaugregory are very abundant in shallow water back reef habitats (1-2 m depth) while cocoa damselfish are restricted to the base of the forereef (10-15 m depth).
   In this study, the roles of habitat selection at settlement and juvenile persistence were investigated to determine their influence on this pattern of zonation. Settlement events observed at intervals over a two-year period revealed that habitat selection occurred at settlement and was confined to habitats occupied by adults. In addition, differences in juvenile persistence (due to mortality and/or emigration) were found when species were translocated between depths. Over a period of 100-days, juvenile beaugregory moved from 1 m to 12 m depth suffered four-fold greater losses at the deeper sites than shallow water controls, while translocated cocoa damsel-fish suffered twice as many losses in shallow water than controls at 12 m depth. Despite these differences in persistence, growth rates of the two species were similar and independent of depth. These results indicate that preferential habitat selection at settlement, perhaps an evolutionary response to differential juvenile mortality, may play a deciding role in determining distributions of ecologically similar species of coral reef fishes.

AB The significant problems caused by soilborne pathogens in crop production worldwide include reduced crop performance, decreased yield, and higher production costs. In many parts of the world, methyl bromide was extensively used to control these pathogens before the implementation of the Montreal Protocol-a global agreement to protect the ozone layer. The threats of soilborne disease epidemics in crop production, high cost of chemical fungicides and development of fungicide resistance, climate change, new disease outbreaks and increasing concerns regarding environmental as well as soil health are becoming increasingly evident. These necessitate the use of integrated soilborne disease management strategies for crop production. This article summarizes methods for management of soilborne diseases in crop production which includes the use of sanitation, legal methods, resistant cultivars/varieties and grafting, cropping system, soil solarization, biofumigants, soil amendments, anaerobic soil disinfestation, soil steam sterilization, soil fertility and plant nutrients, soilless culture, chemical control and biological control in a system-based approach. Different methods with their strengths and weaknesses, mode of action and interactions are discussed, concluding with a brief outline of future directions which might lead to the integration of described methods in a system-based approach for more effective management of soilborne diseases.

AB In a rapidly changing climate, alpine plants may persist by adapting to new conditions. However, the rate at which the climate is changing might exceed the rate of adaptation through evolutionary processes in long-lived plants. Persistence may depend on phenotypic plasticity in morphology and physiology. Here we investigated patterns of leaf trait variation including leaf area, leaf thickness, specific leaf area, leaf dry matter content, leaf nutrients (C, N, P) and isotopes (delta C-13 and delta N-15) across an elevation gradient on Gongga Mountain, Sichuan Province, China. We quantified inter- and intra-specific trait variation and the plasticity in leaf traits of selected species to experimental warming and cooling by using a reciprocal transplantation approach. We found substantial phenotypic plasticity in most functional traits where ON, leaf area, and leaf P showed greatest plasticity. These traits did not correspond with traits with the largest amount of intraspecific variation. Plasticity in leaf functional traits tended to enable plant populations to shift their trait values toward the mean values of a transplanted plants' destination community, but only if that population started with very different trait values. These results suggest that leaf trait plasticity is an important mechanism for enabling plants to persist within communities and to better tolerate changing environmental conditions under climate change.

AB A consistent determinant of the establishment success of alien species appears to be the number of individuals that are introduced to found a population (propagule pressure), yet variation in the form of this relationship has been largely unexplored. Here, we present the first quantitative systematic review of this form, using Bayesian meta-analytical methods. The relationship between propagule pressure and establishment success has been evaluated for a broad range of taxa and life histories, including invertebrates, herbaceous plants and long-lived trees, and terrestrial and aquatic vertebrates. We found a positive mean effect of propagule pressure on establishment success to be a feature of every hypothesis we tested. However, establishment success most critically depended on propagule pressures in the range of 10-100 individuals. Heterogeneity in effect size was associated primarily with different analytical approaches, with some evidence of larger effect sizes in animal rather than plant introductions. Conversely, no variation was accounted for in any analysis by the scale of study (field to global) or methodology (observational, experimental, or proxy) used. Our analyses reveal remarkable consistency in the form of the relationship between propagule pressure and alien population establishment success.

AB Coral reefs have entered an era of 'ecological crisis' as climate change drives catastrophic reef loss worldwide. Coral growth and stress susceptibility are regulated by their endosymbiotic dinoflagellates (genus Symbiodinium). The phylogenetic diversity of Symbiodinium frequently corresponds to patterns of coral health and survival, but knowledge of functional diversity is ultimately necessary to reconcile broader ecological success over space and time. We explore here functional traits underpinning the complex biology of Symbiodinium that spans free-living algae to coral endosymbionts. In doing so we propose a mechanistic framework integrating the primary traits of resource acquisition and utilisation as a means to explain Symbiodinium functional diversity and to resolve the role of Symbiodinium in driving the stability of coral reefs under an uncertain future.

AB Interdisciplinarity is needed to gain knowledge of the ecology of invasive species and invaded ecosystems, and of the human dimensions of biological invasions. We combine a quantitative literature review with a qualitative historical narrative to document the progress of interdisciplinarity in invasion science since 1950. Our review shows that 92.4% of interdisciplinary publications (out of 9192) focus on ecological questions, 4.4% on social ones, and 3.2% on social-ecological ones. The emergence of invasion science out of ecology might explain why interdisciplinarity has remained mostly within the natural sciences. Nevertheless, invasion science is attracting social-ecological collaborations to understand ecological challenges, and to develop novel approaches to address new ideas, concepts, and invasion-related questions between scholars and stakeholders. We discuss ways to reframe invasion science as a field centred on interlinked social-ecological dynamics to bring science, governance and society together in a common effort to deal with invasions.

AB Coral reefs are subjected to unprecedented levels of disturbance with population growth and climate change combining to reduce standing coral cover and stocks of reef fishes. Most of the damage is concentrated in shallow waters (< 30 m deep) where humans can comfortably operate and where physical disturbances are most disruptive to marine organisms. Yet coral reefs can extend to depths exceeding 100 m, potentially offering refuge from the threats facing shallower reefs. We deployed baited remote underwater stereo-video systems (stereo-BRUVs) at depths of 10-90 m around the southern Mariana Islands to investigate whether fish species targeted by fishing in the shallows may be accruing benefits from being at depth. We show that biomass, abundance and species richness of fishery-targeted species increased from shallow reef areas to a depth of 60 m, whereas at greater depths, a lack of live coral habitat corresponded to lower numbers of fish. The majority of targeted species were found to have distributions that ranged from shallow depths (10 m) to depths of at least 70 m, emphasising that habitat, not depth, is the limiting factor in their vertical distribution. While the gradient of abundance and biomass versus depth was steepest for predatory species, the first species usually targeted by fishing, we also found that fishery-targeted herbivores prevailed in similar biomass and species richness to 60 m. Compared to shallow marine protected areas, there was clearly greater biomass of fishery-targeted species accrued in mesophotic depths. Particularly some species typically harvested by depth-limited fishing methods (e.g., spearfishing), such as the endangered humphead wrasse Cheilinus undulatus, were found in greater abundance on deeper reefs. We conclude that mesophotic depths provide essential fish habitat and refuge for fishery-targeted species, representing crucial zones for fishery management and research into the resilience of disturbed coral reef ecosystems.

AB Spatial prioritization in conservation is required to direct limited resources to where actions are most urgently needed and most likely to produce effective conservation outcomes. In an effort to advance the protection of a highly threatened hotspot of marine biodiversity, the Mediterranean Sea, multiple spatial conservation plans have been developed in recent years. Here, we review and integrate these different plans with the goal of identifying priority conservation areas that represent the current consensus among the different initiatives. A review of six existing and twelve proposed conservation initiatives highlights gaps in conservation and management planning, particularly within the southern and eastern regions of the Mediterranean and for offshore and deep sea habitats. The eighteen initiatives vary substantially in their extent (covering 0.1-58.5% of the Mediterranean Sea) and in the location of additional proposed conservation and management areas. Differences in the criteria, approaches and data used explain such variation. Despite the diversity among proposals, our analyses identified ten areas, encompassing 10% of the Mediterranean Sea, that are consistently identified among the existing proposals, with an additional 10% selected by at least five proposals. These areas represent top priorities for immediate conservation action. Despite the plethora of initiatives, major challenges face Mediterranean biodiversity and conservation. These include the need for spatial prioritization within a comprehensive framework for regional conservation planning, the acquisition of additional information from data-poor areas, species or habitats, and addressing the challenges of establishing transboundary governance and collaboration in socially, culturally and politically complex conditions. Collective prioritised action, not new conservation plans, is needed for the north, western, and high seas of the Mediterranean, while developing initial information-based plans for the south and eastern Mediterranean is an urgent requirement for true regional conservation planning.

AB Despite general agreement on antagonist relationships between ecosystems capacity to simultaneously sustain the availability of regulating services and agricultural production, it is not clear how these tradeoffs operate in response to complexity loss at the rural landscapes level. Here we present a novel evaluation framework of ecosystem services (ES) and pose different response models to landscape complexity. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that complementarities among different ES types increase and the strength of their apparent tradeoffs diminishes with the spatial complexity of the rural landscapes, using a one million has basin of the Argentine pampas as study case. According to correlation and principal component analysis, main ES tradeoffs among ES availability observed at two spatial scales were represented by crop production vs. the other evaluated ES types (OES), and in contrast with our prediction, their strength was not higher for the fine- than for the coarse-scale (relatively large and internally complex observation units). Landscape composition and configuration indices showed a complementary capacity to explain spatial variation in OES, but combinations of configuration indices showed a higher explanatory value than composition ones. Widely accepted tradeoffs among ecosystem services at local levels, not only were able to explain their antagonistic but also their synergistic availability at intermediate levels of conversion of managed grasslands to croplands, depending on the evaluation scale. Despite intermediate complexity hypothesis was only partly supported by our results, these offer novel evidences about emergent responses in the form of nonlinearities and thresholds of total ES in relation to landscape complexity, which deserve further attention because of their relevance for land use planning.

AB Understanding changes in community composition caused by invasive species is critical for predicting effects on ecosystem function, particularly when the invasive threatens a foundation species. Here we focus on dynamics of forest structure, composition and microclimate, and how these interact in southern Appalachian riparian forests following invasion by hemlock woolly adelgid, HWA, Adelges tsugae. We measured and quantified changes in microclimate; canopy mortality; canopy and shrub growth; understory species composition; and the cover and diversity in riparian forests dominated by eastern hemlock Tsuga canadensis over a period of seven years. Treatments manipulated hemlock mortality either through invasion (HWA infested stands) or girdling (GDL) hemlock trees.
   Mortality was rapid, with 50% hemlock tree mortality occurring after six years of invasion, in contrast to more than 50% mortality in two years following girdling. Although 50% of hemlock trees were still alive five years after infestation, leaf area lost was similar to that of girdled trees. As such, overall responses over time ( changes in light transmittance, growth, soil moisture) were identical to girdled stands with 100% mortality. Our results showed different growth responses of the canopy species, shrubs and ground layer, with the latter being substantially influenced by presence of the evergreen shrub, rhododendron Rhododendron maximum. Although ground layer richness in the infested and girdled stands increased by threefold, they did not approach levels recorded in hardwood forests without rhododendron. Increased growth of co- occurring canopy trees occurred in the first few years following hemlock decline, with similar responses in both treatments. In contrast, growth of rhododendron continued to increase over time. By the end of the study it had a 2.6- fold higher growth rate than expected, likely taking advantage of increased light available during leaf- off periods of the deciduous species. Increased growth and dominance of rhododendron may be a major determinant of future responses in southern Appalachian ecosystems; however, our results suggest hemlock will be replaced by a mix of Acer, Betula, Fagus and Quercus canopy genera where establishment is not limited by rhododendron.

TI A degradation threshold for irreversible loss of soil productivity: a

AB 1. During the past three decades, conservation and restoration biologists have increasingly recognized that ecological communities are likely to exhibit threshold changes in structure. However, because long-term monitoring data are generally lacking, little is known about the consequences of such ecological thresholds for the processes of ecosystem degradation and recovery.
   2. To identify whether a degradation threshold exists that defines the boundary between the possibility of natural recovery and the need for artificial restoration of an ecosystem and to use this knowledge to support the development of a suitable strategy for environmental restoration, we performed long-term monitoring of vegetation recovery in China's Changting County since 1984.
   3. A major problem was identified, which we refer to as the 'irreversible loss of soil services'; when vegetation cover decreases below a degradation threshold, this leads to sustained degeneration of the vegetation community, erosion of the surface soil and declining soil fertility. These changes represent a severe and long-lasting disturbance that will prevent ecosystem recovery in the absence of comprehensive artificial restoration measures.
   4. Synthesis and applications. We identified a degradation threshold at about 20% vegetation cover suggesting that for some sites, vegetation cover can serve as a simple proxy for more sophisticated approaches to identifying thresholds; restoration must start with the restoration of soil fertility and continue by facilitating vegetation development. Our results support the concept of ecological thresholds (specifically, for soil services in a warm and wet region) and provide a model to inform restoration strategies for other degraded ecosystems.

AB P>1. Palaeolimnology and contemporary ecology are complementary disciplines but are rarely combined. By reviewing the literature and using a case study, we show how linking the timescales of these approaches affords a powerful means of understanding ecological change in shallow lakes.
   2. Recently, palaeolimnology has largely been pre-occupied with developing transfer functions which use surface sediment-lake environment datasets to reconstruct a single environmental variable. Such models ignore complex controls over biological structure and can be prone to considerable error in prediction. Furthermore, by reducing species assemblage data to a series of numbers, transfer functions neglect valuable ecological information on species' seasonality, habitat structure and food web interactions. These elements can be readily extracted from palaeolimnological data with the interpretive assistance of contemporary experiments and surveys. For example, for one shallow lake, we show how it is possible to infer long-term seasonality change from plant macrofossil and fossil diatom data with the assistance of seasonal datasets on macrophyte and algal dynamics.
   3. On the other hand, theories on shallow lake functioning have generally been developed from short-term (< 1-15 years) studies as opposed to palaeo-data that cover the actual timescales (decades-centuries) of shallow lake response to stressors such as eutrophication and climate change. Palaeolimnological techniques can track long-term dynamics in lakes whilst smoothing out short-term variability and thus provide a unique and important means of not only developing ecological theories, but of testing them.
   4. By combining contemporary ecology and palaeolimnology, it should be possible to gain a fuller understanding of changing ecological patterns and processes in shallow lakes on multiple timescales.

AB 1. Population density is a critical ecological parameter informing effective wildlife management and conservation decisions. Density is often estimated by dividing capture-recapture (C-R) estimates of abundance ((N) over cap) by size of the study area, but this relies on the assumption of geographic closure - a situation rarely achieved in studies of large carnivores. For geographically open populations (N) over cap is overestimated relative to the size of the study area because animals with only part of their home range on the study area are available for capture. This bias ('edge effect') is more severe when animals such as large carnivores range widely. To compensate for edge effect, a boundary strip around the trap array is commonly included when estimating the effective trap area ((A) over cap). Various methods for estimating the width of the boundary strip are proposed, but (N) over cap/(A) over cap estimates of large carnivore density are generally mistrusted unless concurrent telemetry data are available to define (A) over cap. Remote sampling by cameras or hair snags may reduce study costs and duration, yet without telemetry data inflated density estimates remain problematic.
   2. We evaluated recently developed spatially explicit capture-recapture (SECR) models using data from a common large carnivore, the American black bear Ursus americanus, obtained by remote sampling of 11 geographically open populations. These models permit direct estimation of population density from C-R data without assuming geographic closure. We compared estimates derived using this approach to those derived using conventional approaches that estimate density as (N) over cap/(A) over cap.
   3. Spatially explicit C-R estimates were 20-200% lower than densities estimated as (N) over cap/(A) over cap. AIC(c) supported individual heterogeneity in capture probabilities and home range sizes. Variable home range size could not be accounted for when estimating density as (N) over cap/(A) over cap.
   4. Synthesis and applications. We conclude that the higher densities estimated as (N) over cap/(A) over cap compared to estimates from SECR models are consistent with positive bias due to edge effects in the former. Inflated density estimates could lead to management decisions placing threatened or endangered large carnivores at greater risk. Such decisions could be avoided by estimating density by SECR when bias due to geographic closure violation cannot be minimized by study design.

AB Ancient DNA analyses of historical, archaeological and paleontological remains can contribute important information for the conservation of populations and species that cannot be obtained any other way. In addition to ancient DNA analyses involving a single or few individuals, population level studies are now possible. Biases inherent in estimating population parameters and history from modern genetic diversity are exaggerated when populations are small or have been heavily impacted by recent events, as is common for many endangered species. Going directly back in time to study past populations removes many of the assumptions that undermine conclusions based only on recent populations. Accurate characterization of historic population size, levels of gene flow and relationships with other populations are fundamental to developing appropriate conservation and management plans. The incorporation of ancient DNA into conservation genetics holds a lot of potential, if it is employed responsibly.

AB 1. A large proportion of the world's land surface is extensively managed for livestock production. In areas where livestock systems are becoming more intensive, a major challenge is to predict those plant species likely to decline, persist or increase as a result of agricultural intensification.
   2. Most analyses develop inferences for frequent or abundant species, or rely on intensive studies of single species. A promising approach is to identify plant traits related to disturbance to enable inference to be made about changes in plant community composition. We used a Bayesian hierarchical model to analyse the response to agricultural intensification of 494 plant species of pastures and woodlands in southern Australia, and to identify how simple species' traits (life form, growth form and species origin) influence those responses.
   3. The probability of occurrence of most species declined along the two intensification gradients, grazing intensity and soil phosphorous concentration, although the occurrence of a greater proportion of species was negatively correlated with soil phosphorous. Responses could be broadly predicted from both plant origin and plant traits, in particular growth form.
   4. Native perennial geophytes, ferns and shrubs were most negatively affected by both gradients, while exotic annual grasses and forbs were more tolerant. Along the phosphorous gradient, 24 of the 30 most negatively affected plant species were native geophytes. Mean within-group responses masked considerable within- and between-species variation, particularly for the exotic species group which included species that responded both negatively and positively to intensification.
   5. Synthesis and applications. The hierarchical model described here provides a powerful method for estimating individual plant responses and identifying how species' traits influence those responses. Plant species native to southern Australia are sensitive to grazing and phosphorous apparently due to a shared evolutionary history of low grazing intensity and low phosphorous soils. Invading exotic plants have faced strongly contrasting ecological filters, leading to a greater diversity of responses. Where grazing systems have been most intense, a small suite of exotics dominate. Maintaining native and functional plant diversity will necessitate limits being placed on intensive livestock management systems.

AB 1. Rainfall is the prime climatic factor underpinning the dynamics of African savanna ungulates, but no study has analysed its influence on the abundance of these ungulates at monthly to multiannual time scales.
   2. We report relationships between rainfall and changes in age- and sex-structured abundances of seven ungulate species monitored monthly for 15 years using vehicle ground counts in the Maasai Mara National Reserve, Kenya.
   3. Abundance showed strong and curvilinear relationships with current and cumulative rainfall, with older topi, Damaliscus korrigum (Ogilby); warthog, Phacochoerus aethiopicus (Pallas); waterbuck, Kobus ellipsyprimnus (Ogilby); and impala, Aepyceros melampus (Lichtenstein) responding to longer lags than younger animals, portraying carryover effects of prior habitat conditions.
   4. The abundances of newborn calves were best correlated with monthly rainfall averaged over the preceding 5-6 months for topi, waterbuck, warthog, and 2 months for the migratory zebra Equus burchelli (Gray), but with seasonal rainfall averaged over 2-5 years for giraffe, Giraffa camelopardalis (L.); impala; and kongoni, Alcelaphus busephalus (Pallas). The cumulative late wet-season rainfall was the best predictor of abundance for quarter- to full-grown animals for most species. Monthly rainfall exerted both negative and positive effects on the abundances of zebra, impala and waterbuck. Ignoring age, both sexes responded similarly to rainfall.
   5. Births were strongly seasonal only for warthog and topi, but peaked between August and December for most species. Hence abundance was strongly seasonal for young topi and warthog and the migratory zebra. Pronounced seasonality in births for warthog and topi obliterated otherwise strong relationships between abundance and rainfall when both month and rainfall were included in the same model. Aggregated density produced relationships with rainfall similar to those for fully grown animals, emphasizing the necessity of demographic monitoring to reliably reveal rainfall influences on ungulate abundance in the Mara.
   6. Strong relationships between abundance and rainfall suggest that rainfall underpins the dynamics of African savanna ungulates, and that changes in rainfall due to global warming may markedly alter the abundance and diversity of these mammals. Ungulates respond to rainfall fluctuations through movements, reproduction or survival, and the responses appear independent of breeding phenology and synchrony, dietary guild, or degree of water dependence. Newborns and adults have contrasting responses to rainfall. Males and females respond similarly to rainfall when age is ignored.

AB Predator and prey spatial distributions have important population and community level consequences. However, little is known either theoretically or empirically about behavioral mechanisms that underlie the spatial patterns that emerge when predators and prey freely interact. We examined the joint space use and behavioral rules governing movement of freely interacting groups of odonate (dragonfly) predators and two size classes of anuran (tadpole) prey in arenas containing two patches with different levels of the prey's resource. Predator and prey movement and space use was quantified both when they were apart and together. When apart from predators, large tadpoles strongly preferred the high resource patch. When apart from prey, dragonflies weakly preferred the high resource patch. When together, large prey shifted to a uniform distribution, while predators strongly preferred the high resource patch. These patterns qualitatively fit the predictions of several three trophic level, ideal free distribution models. In contrast, the space use of small prey and predators did not deviate from uniform. Three measures of joint space use ( spatial correlations, overlap, and co-occurrence) concurred in suggesting that prey avoidance of predators was more important than predator attraction to prey in determining overall spatial patterns. To gain additional insight into behavioral mechanisms, we used a model selection approach to identify behavioral movement rules that can potentially explain the observed, emergent patterns of space use. Prey were more likely to leave patches with more predators and more conspecific competitors; resources had relatively weak effects on prey movements. In contrast, predators were more likely to leave patches with low resources (that they do not consume) and more competing predators; prey had relatively little effect on predator movements. These results highlight the importance of investigating freely interacting predators and prey, the potential for simple game theory models to predict joint spatial distributions, and the utility of using model choice methods to identify potential key factors that govern movement.

AB The ecological component is crucial in landscape planning according to the principles of sustainable development. We define "ecologically sustainable landscape" and develop a tool to measure how ecological sustainability is incorporated in landscape plans. This method acknowledges the critical role of spatial scale and pattern to the conservation of biodiversity. The metapopulation concept is used as a spatially explicit ecological theory, appropriate to describe the relation between biodiversity and the pattern of ecosystem patches ("ecosystem network") in intensively used regions. We propose that ecological sustainability is achieved if quality, area and configuration of the ecosystem network permit target species to persist. A simple decision-making model represents a theoretical framework for a tool comprising two sets of ecological indicators. One set indicates the awareness of actors to consider ecological principles of sustainable planning. The other set indicates their performance to apply these principles quantitatively in designing the ecosystem pattern. The method is applied on a sample of reports on Dutch landscape development plans. A majority of the reports shows awareness of the importance of spatial conditions for achieving planning goals, but perform inadequately on the quantitative indicators. We conclude that the tool could be developed as a guideline and assessment method for the ecological sustainability of landscape plans. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Roads remove habitat, alter adjacent areas, and interrupt and redirect ecological flows. They subdivide wildlife populations, foster invasive species spread, change the hydrologic network, and increase human use of adjacent areas. At broad scales, these impacts cumulate and define landscape patterns. The goal of this study was to improve our understanding of the dynamics of road networks over time, and their effects on landscape patterns, and identify significant relationships between road changes and other land-use changes. We mapped roads from aerial photographs from five dates between 1937 and 1999 in 17 townships in predominantly forested landscapes in northern Wisconsin, USA. Patch-level landscape metrics were calculated on terrestrial area outside of a 15-m road-effect zone. We used generalized least-squares regression models to relate changes in road density and landscape pattern to concurrent changes in housing density. Rates of change and relationships were compared among three ecological regions. Our results showed substantial increases in both road density and landscape fragmentation during the study period. Road density more than doubled, and median, mean, and largest patch size were reduced by a factor of four, while patch shape became more regular. Increases in road density varied significantly among ecological subsections and were positively related to increases in housing density. Fragmentation was largely driven by increases in road density, but housing density had a significantly positive relationship with largest patch area and patch shape. Without protection of roadless areas, our results suggest road development is likely to continue in the future, even in areas where road construction is constrained by the physical environment. Recognizing the dynamic nature of road networks is important for understanding and predicting their ecological impacts over time and understanding where other types of development are likely to occur in the future. Historical perspectives of development can provide guidance in prioritizing management efforts to defragment landscapes and mitigate the ecological impacts of past road development.

AB Aim To address the relative role of adjacent land use, distance to forest edge, forest size and their interactions on understorey plant species richness and composition in perimetropolitan forests.
   Location The metropolitan area of Barcelona, north-eastern Spain.
   Methods Twenty sampling sites were distributed in two forest size-categories: small forest patches (8-90 ha) and large forest areas (> 18,000 ha). For each forest-size category, five sites were placed adjacent to crops and five sites adjacent to urban areas. Vascular plant species were recorded and human frequentation was scored visually in 210 10 x 10 m plots placed at 10, 50 and 100 m from the forest edge, and additionally at 500 m in large forest areas. Plant species were grouped according to their ecology and rarity categories. A nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMS) ordination was carried out to detect patterns of variation in species assemblage, and to explore the relationships between these patterns and the richness of the species groups and the studied factors. Factorial ANOVAS were used to test the significance of the studied factors on the richness of species groups. Relationships between human frequentation and the studied variables were assessed through contingency tables.
   Results Forest-size category was the main factor affecting synanthropic species (i.e. those thriving in man-made or man-disturbed habitats). Synanthropic species richness decreased with increasing distance from the forest edge and, when forests were adjacent to crops, it was higher in small forest patches than in large forest areas. Richness of rare forest species was lower in small forest patches than in large forest areas when forests were adjacent to urban areas. Richness of common forest species and of all forest species together were higher close to the forest edge than far from it when forests were adjacent to urban areas. Forests adjacent to urban areas were more likely to experience high human frequentation, particularly in those plots nearest to the forest edge.
   Main conclusions Forest-size category and adjacent land use were the most important factors determining species richness and composition. The preservation of large forests adjacent to crops in peri-urban areas is recommended, because they are less frequented by humans, are better buffered against the percolation of nonforest species and could favour the persistence of rare forest species.

AB A new predictive modelling technique called the fuzzy envelope model (FEM) is introduced. The technique can be used to predict potential distributions of organisms using presence-only locality records and a set of environmental predictor variables. FEM uses fuzzy logic to classify a set of predictor variable maps based on the values associated with presence records and combines the results to produce a potential distribution map for a target species. This technique represents several refinements of the envelope approach used in the BIOCLIM modelling package. These refinements are related to the way in which FEMs deal with uncertainty, the way in which this uncertainty is represented in the resultant potential distribution maps, and the way that these maps can be interpreted and applied. To illustrate its potential use in biogeographical studies, FEM was applied to predicting the potential distribution of three invasive alien plant species (Lantana camara L., Ricinus communis L. and Solanum mauritianum Scop.), and three native cicada species (Capicada decora Germar, Platypleura deusta Thun. and P. capensis L.) in South Africa, Lesotho and Swaziland. These models were quantitatively compared with models produced by means of the algorithm used in the BIOCLIM modelling package, which is referred to as a crisp envelope model (the CEM design). The average performance of models of the FEM design was consistently higher than those of the CEM design. There were significant differences in model performance among species but there was no significant interaction between model design and species. The average maximum kappa value ranged from 0.70 to 0.90 for FEM design and from 0.57 to 0.89 for the CEM design, which can be described as 'good' to 'excellent' using published ranges of agreement for the kappa statistic. This technique can be used to predict species' potential distributions that could be used for identifying regions at risk from invasion by alien species. These predictions could also be used in conservation planning in the case of native species.

AB Research on nutrient acquisition by symbiotic arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi has mainly focused on the root fungus interface and less attention has been given to the growth and functioning of external hyphae in the bulk soil. The growth and function of external hyphae may be affected by unfavourable soil environments, such as compacted soils in which pores may be narrow. The effects of pore size on the growth of two AM fungi (Glomus intraradices and G. mosseae) and their ability to transport P-33 from the bulk soil to the host were investigated. Trifolium subterraneum L. plants were grown individually in 'single arm cross-pots' with and without AM fungi. The side arm was separated from the main compartment by nylon mesh to prevent root penetration. It contained three zones: 5 mm of soil: sand mix (HC1); 25 mm of media treatment (HC2); and 20 mm of P-33-labelled soil (HC3). There were four media treatments; soil and three types of quartz sand with most common continuous pore diameters of 100, 38 and 26 mum. AM plants had similar growth and total P uptake in all treatments. However, plants grown with G. intraradices contained almost three times more P-33 than those grown with G. mosseae, indicating G. intraradices obtained a greater proportion of P at a distance from the host roots. Differences in P acquisition were not correlated with production of external hyphae in the four media zones and changes in sand pore size did not affect the ability of the fungi studied to acquire P at a distance from the host roots. Production of external hyphae in HC2 was influenced by fungal species and media treatment. Both fungi produced maximum amounts of external hyphae in the soil medium. Sand pore size affected growth of G. intraradices (but not G. mosseae) and hyphal diameter distributions of both fungi. The results suggest that not only are G. mosseae and G. intraradices functionally complementary in terms of spatial phosphorus acquisition, they are also capable of altering their morphology in response to the soil environment.

AB Rhexia, with 11 species in the Coastal Plain province of North America, is the only temperate zone endemic of the tropical eudicot family Melastomataceae. It is a member of the only pantropical tribe of that family, Melastomeae. Based on the chloroplast gene ndhF, we use a fossil-calibrated molecular clock to address the question of the geographic origin and age of Rhexia. Sequences from 37 species in 21 genera representing the tribe's geographical range were analyzed together with five outgroups. To obtain better clade support, another chloroplast region, the rpl16 intron, was added for 24 of the species. Parsimony analysis of the combined data and maximum-likelihood analysis of ndhF alone indicate that the deepest split is between Rhexia plus its sister group, a small Central American genus, and all other Melastomeae. Old World Melastomeae are monophyletic and nested within New World Melastomeae. Although likelihood-ratio tests of clock and nonclock substitution models for the full or moderately pruned datasets rejected the clock, these models yielded identical topologies (for 30 taxa) with few significantly different branch lengths as assessed by a Student's t-test. Age estimates obtained were 22 million years ago (Mya) for the divergence of Rhexia from its sister group, 12 Mya for the dispersal of Melastomeae from the New World to West Africa, and 1 Mya for the diversification of Melastoma in Southeast Asia. The only other genus of Melastomeae to have reached Southeast Asia from Africa or Madagascar is Osbeckia. The age and geographic distribution of fossils, which come from Miocene sites throughout Eurasia, suggest that Melastomeae once ranged from Eurasia across Beringia to North America from whence they reached South America and subsequently Africa and Southeast Asia. Climate deterioration led to their extinction in the Northern Hemisphere, with Rhexia possibly surviving in Coastal Plain refugia.

AB Photosynthetic light acclimation of leaves can result from (i) changes in mass-based leaf nitrogen concentration, N-m, (ii) changes in leaf mass:area ratio, M-a, and (iii) partitioning of total leaf nitrogen among different pools of the photosynthetic machinery. We studied variations in N-m and M-a within the crowns of two peach (Prunus persica L. Batsch) trees grown in an orchard in Portugal, and one peach tree grown in an orchard in France. Each crown was digitized and a 3-D radiation transfer model was used to quantify the intra-crown variations in time-integrated leaf irradiance, <PAR(i)>. Nitrogen concentration, leaf mass:area ratio, chlorophyll concentration, and photosynthetic capacity were also measured on leaves sampled on five additional peach trees in the orchard in Portugal. The data were used to compute the coefficients of leaf nitrogen partitioning among carboxylation, bioenergetics, and light harvesting pools. Leaf mass:area ratio and area-based leaf nitrogen concentration, N-a, were nonlinearly related to <PAR(i)>, and photosynthetic capacity was linearly related to N-a. Photosynthetic light acclimation resulted mainly from changes in M-a and leaf nitrogen partitioning, and to a lesser extent from changes in N-m. This behavior contrasts with photosynthetic light acclimation observed in other tree species like walnut (Juglans regia L.) in which acclimation results primarily from changes in M-a.

AB The region of Madang, Papua New Guinea, has the highest reported species diversity of both anemonefishes (nine species) and their host anemones (ten species). To determine which factors may allow so many anemonefish species to coexist at this location, we studied their patterns of distribution, abundance, and recruitment. Population surveys at three replicate reef sites within four zones situated at varying distances from the mainland (nearshore, mid-lagoon, outer barrier, and offshore) indicated that each species of host anemone and anemonefish lived within a particular range of zones. Each species of anemonefish lived primarily with one species of host. Anemonefish species that lived with the same host species usually had different distribution patterns among zones (e.g., Amphiprion percula occupied Heteractis magnifica in nearshore zones, while A. perideraion occupied H. magnifica in offshore zones). Monitoring of natural populations showed that there were few changes (losses or recruitment) in the number or species of fishes associated with each individual anemone over periods ranging from 3 to 9 months. Recruitment was monitored on anemones with and without residents (resident fishes were removed) within each of three zones (nearshore, mid-lagoon, enter barrier). Significantly more anemonefishes recruited to anemones without resident fishes than to anemones with resident fishes. Each anemonefish species recruited to particular host species and zones. The distribution and abundance of the recruits of each fish species amongzones were positively correlated with the distribution and abundance of resident fishes in the benthic habitat. This suggests that the spatial patterns of recruitment among zones strongly determined the distribution and abundance patterns of the benthic populations, and they were not the result of post-recruitment mortality or movement. Coexistence of the nine anemonefish species on the limited anemone resource was considered possible because of niche differentiation (i.e., differences in host and habitat utilization among zones), and the ability of two small species (i.e., Amphiprion sandaracinos and A. leucokranos) to cohabit individual anemones with other anemonefish species.

AB To evaluate the genetic diversity and understand the evolution of Yam mosaic virus (YMV), a highly destructive pathogen of yam (Dioscorea sp,), sequencing was carried out of the C-terminal part of the replicase (Nlb), the coat protein (CP) and the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of 27 YMV isolates collected from the three main cultivated species (Dioscorea alata, the complex Dioscorea cayenensis-Dioscorea rotundata and Dioscorea trifida). YMV showed the most variable CP relative to eight other potyrviruses. This high variability was structured into nine distant molecular groups, as revealed by phylogenetic analyses and validated by assessment of the molecular evolutionary noise. No correlation was observed between the CP and 3'-UTR diversities and phylogenies. The most diversified and divergent groups included isolates from Africa. The remaining groups clustered in a single clade and a geographical distinction between isolates from the Caribbean, South America and Africa was observed. The role of the host in the selection of particular isolates was illustrated by the case of a divergent cultivar from Burkina Faso, Phylogenetic topological incongruence and complementary statistical tests highlighted the fact that recombination events, with single and multiple crossover sites, largely contributed to the evolution of YMV, We hypothesise an African origin of YMV from the yam complex D, cayenensis-D. rotundata, followed by independent transfers to D, alata and D, trifida during virus evolution.

AB Relationships between CO2 assimilation at light saturation (A(max)), nitrogen (N) content and weight per unit area (W-A) were studied in leaves grown with contrasting irradiances (outer canopy versus inner canopy) and N supply rates in field-grown nectarine trees Prunus persica L. Batsch. cv. Fantasia. Both A(max) and N content per unit leaf area (N-A) were linearly correlated to W-A, but leaves in the high-N treatment had higher N-A and A(max) for the same value of W-A than leaves in the low-N treatment. The curvilinear relationship between photosynthesis and total leaf N was independent of treatments, both when expressed per unit leaf area (A(maxA) and N-A) and per unit leaf weight (A(maxW) and N-W), but the relationship was stronger when data were expressed on a leaf area basis. Both A(maxA) and N-A were higher for outer canopy leaves than for inner canopy leaves and A(maxW) and N-W were higher for leaves in the high-N treatment than for leaves in the low-N treatment.
   The relationship between A(max) and N resulted in a similar photosynthetic nitrogen-use efficiency at light saturation (A(max) NUE) for both N and light treatments. Photosynthetic nitrogen-use efficiency was similar among treatments throughout the whole light response curve of photosynthesis. Leaves developed in shade conditions did not show higher N-use efficiency at low irradiance.
   At any intercellular CO2 partial pressure (C-i), photosynthetic CO2 response curves were higher for outer canopy leaves and, within each light treatment, were higher for the high-N treatments than for the low-N treatments. Consequently, most of the differences among treatments disappeared when photosynthesis was expressed per unit N. However, slightly higher assimilation rates per unit N were found for outer canopy leaves compared with inner canopy leaves, in both N treatments.
   Because higher daily irradiance within the canopies of the low-N trees more than compensated for the lower photosynthetic performances of these leaves compared to the leaves of high-N trees, daily carbon gain (and N-use efficiency on a daily assimilation basis) per leaf was higher for the low-N treatment than for the high-N treatment in both outer and inner canopy leaves.

AB Physical control of predation appeared likely in subtidal habitats of fjords in southwestern New Zealand because they intersect a shallow low-salinity layer (LSL) where marine predators might be excluded by low-salinity stress. We investigated links between predator distributions, predation intensity, rainfall, the depth of the LSL, and sessile invertebrate community structure at two sites in Doubtful Sound, New Zealand. Sessile invertebrate communities living on the rock walls of the fjord showed striking patterns of vertical zonation corresponding to the depth of the LSL. Barnacles and mussels, Mytilus edulis galloprovincialis, were most abundant at the 1-3 m depth range commonly bathed by the LSL, while sponges, bryozoans, and ascidians dominated space below it (6-18 m depth). Mussel abundance declined sharply with depth at both sites, from maxima of 52-80% cover in the LSL (3 m) to <2% cover just below the LSL (6 m). To test the hypothesis that the LSL influences the lower limit of the mussel zone by excluding predators and reducing predation from mobile invertebrates living below it, we measured predator densities and tracked predation on transplanted mussels, M. e. galloprovincialis, in the LSL (2.5 m depth) and at 3-4 depths below. Predators were most abundant just below the lower boundary of the LSL during February and April 1993. No transplanted mussels were consumed in the LSL at 2.5 m, but 20-80% of them were consumed in experiments conducted below it, indicating that the LSL represents a spatial refuge from predation.
   The shallowing of the LSL to 1.5 m depth during low rainfall in November 1993 provided an additional opportunity to evaluate the influence of the LSL on predation. Repeated predator surveys showed that sea stars and urchins moved up with the ascending LSL to create a pattern of high predator abundance at 2.5 m depth in November, suggesting that the shallow zone previously buffered from predation by the LSL was not a predation refuge in November.
   Rainfall and salinity at 2.5 m depth were inversely related. A significant regression of rainfall one day prior to salinity profiling and the depth of the LSL boundary (30 mg/g salinity) explained 61.5% of the variation in the depth of the boundary, which represented the maximum depth of the predation refuge. The regression enabled us to predict the depth of the predation refuge over a 1.5-yr period beginning in October 1992. The average depth of the refuge was 2.35 m, ranging from 1.5 to 5.6 m as a function of rainfall. Daily tidal variation increased the vertical excursion of the refuge by 0.9-1.7 m. Distinguishing between a partial predation refuge where the LSL occurred at a given depth for a part of a day, and a complete refuge where a depth occurred in the refuge for the entire day, we estimated that the 2.5-m habitat was a complete refuge during 10% of the 18-mo period and a partial predation refuge 90% of the time. The dose correspondence between the average depth of the predation refuge (2.35 m) and the depth of maximum mussel cover (3.0 m) suggests that the mussel zone is restricted to the LSL by high predation at the lower boundary of the layer. The alternative hypothesis, that the lower limit of the mussel zone (6 m depth) was determined by a failure of mussel recruitment to this depth, was tested by a l-yr recruitment experiment. Mussels recruited to the lower edge of the mussel zone at 6 m, although overall levels of mussel recruitment during May 1993-April 1994 were too low to maintain the observed zonation pattern.
   By increasing the spatial extent of the low-salinity layer, we speculate that changes in climatic conditions leading to increased freshwater runoff may alter salinity gradients, bathymetric distributions of predators, and the structure of shallow subtidal communities, especially in fjords.

AB Throughout its distribution in North America, the threatened eastern massasauga rattlesnake (Sistrurus c. catenatus) persists in a series of habitat-isolated disjunct populations of varying size. Here, we use six microsatellite DNA loci to generate information on the degree of genetic differentiation between, and the levels of inbreeding within populations to understand how evolutionary processes operate in these populations and aid the development of conservation plans for this species. Samples were collected from 199 individuals from five populations in Ontario, New York and Ohio. Our results show that all sampled populations: (i) differ significantly in allele frequencies even though some populations are < 50 km apart, and may contain genetically distinct subpopulations < 2 km apart; (ii) have an average of 23% of alleles that are population specific; and (iii) have significant F-IS values (mean overall F-IS = 0.194) probably due to a combination of Wahlund effects resulting from fine-scale genetic differentiation within populations and the presence of null alleles. Our results imply that massasauga populations may be genetically structured on an extremely fine scale even within continuous populations, possibly due to limited dispersal. Additional information is needed to determine if dispersal and mating behaviour within populations can account for this structure and whether the observed differentiation is due to random processes such as drift or to local adaptation From a conservation perspective, our results imply that these massasauga populations should be managed as demographically independent units and that each has high conservation value in terms of containing unique genetic variation.

AB This paper presents a simple algorithm for calculating daily canopy photosynthesis given parameters of the single-leaf light response, the canopy extinction coefficient, canopy leaf area index, daylength, daily solar irradiance and daily maximum and minimum temperatures. Analytical expressions are derived for total daily production by a canopy of leaves whose light response is either a rectangular hyperbola or a Blackman response. An expression which gives an excellent approximation to canopy photosynthesis for an arbitrary hyperbolic light response is then derived. These expressions assume photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) within the canopy follows Beer's law, light-saturated photosynthetic rate at any point in the canopy is proportional to the ratio of local PAR to full-sun PAR, diurnal variation of PAR is sinusoidal, and parameters of the single-leaf photosynthetic light response do not vary diurnally. It is shown how these expressions can be used to accommodate diurnal temperature variation of photosynthesis in a simple manner. The accuracy of the approximation to the basic integral of leaf photosynthesis over the canopy and over time is illustrated by applying the algorithm to compute the seasonal variation of daily canopy photosynthesis and comparing these data with corresponding values obtained by numerical integration.

AB From 1987 to 1992 diet and condition of two populations of wild boar which received no supplementary feeding were studied in the Veluwe area, a large area of heathlands and forests in The Netherlands, and were compared with those obtained in a previous study (1974-1976), when supplementary food was provided. Composition of stomach contents depended mainly on season, mast availability, and area-specific factors, whereas sex and age were of little or no importance. Density dependence was found for the decrease in mast (tree seed) consumption from autumn to winter. In autumn, and in winters of rich mast years, mast was the main constituent of the diet. In winters of poor mast years this was replaced by broadleaved grasses in one area and by broadleaved grasses, wavy hairgrass, and roots in the other. We found no important differences between the stomach contents of animals receiving no supplementation, and the natural fraction during a period of supplementary feeding. Variation in body weight was related mainly to age and sex, but also to mast availability. Judged by relative loss of body weight and decrease of bone marrow fat, juveniles seemed to suffer more from poor mast availability than adults. The decrease in body weight from autumn to winter was greater when population density was high. In poor mast years, recruitment into the population receiving no supplementation depended on the availability of broadleaved grasses; in rich years, recruitment was still lower than in populations receiving supplementary feeding. In populations receiving supplementary feeding, recruitment seemed independent of mast availability.

AB I tested a food web model that predicts how environmental productivity (nutrient supply) and tap carnivores should mediate interactions among herbivores, edible plants, and plants that are resistant to herbivory because they possess anti-herbivore defenses. Feeding trials with the dominant grasshopper herbivore at the study site confirmed that certain plant species were resistant to herbivory because of protection by pubescent leaves and stems. Experimental food webs with various numbers of trophic levels composed of edible and resistant plants, grasshoppers, and hunting spiders were assembled in enclosure cages. I randomly assigned half of the cages to a nutrient-enrichment treatment and half remained as a control. Nutrient supply directly enhanced primary productivity and plant and herbivore biomass. Experimentally changing spider abundance caused a classic ''trophic cascade'' in which herbivore biomass increased and edible plant biomass decreased. Resistant plant biomass increased. These results matched predictions of the model with one exception. A trophic cascade was not observed under enriched conditions. The study nevertheless shows that a simple model attempting to explain heterogeneous interactions in food webs may give considerable insight into the dynamics of natural systems.

AB Spatial patterns in densities and population size structures of three large benthic carnivorous fishes, and behaviour of one of these species, were compared in different parts of the Cape Rodney to Okakari Point Marine Reserve, northeastern New Zealand As human activity is focussed in the central area of the marine reserve, perceptions of the effects of marine reserve protection may be biased if this area is not representative of the entire marine reserve. Abundances of Cheilodactylus spectabilis and Pagrus auratus showed great variation among sites, while those of Parapercis colias were lower and less variable. During summer and winter, large Pagrus auratus were mol e abundant in the mid section of the marine reserve. Pagrus auratus of all sizes were attracted to divers and allowed them to approach more closely in the mid section of the marine reserve. Consequences of protection from hm vesting al e confounded with human-oriented behaviour for Pagrus auratus. Feeding of fish by divers may have altered the behaviour of this species.

AB I investigated the ability of predators to influence the patterns of species richness and abundance of non-piscivorous fishes on small, artificial reefs replenished by natural recruitment. Periodic removal of predators effectively reduced the species richness and abundance of predators on removal reefs. The difference between the number of predators on control and removal reefs was greatest immediately following the removal of predators and attenuated between removals. During periods of recruitment, species richness and total abundance of recently-recruited, non-piscivorous fishes were generally greater on predator-removal reefs than on control reefs. Species richness and total abundance of resident non-piscivorous fishes were not affected by the removal of predators in the first year of the experiment. Both abundance and species richness of residents, however, were greater on the removal reefs during the second year of the experiment. The difference in the responses of the two age classes to the removal of predators suggests that predators may affect community patterns of older age classes through time-lagged effects on the survivorship of younger age classes. At the end of the experiment, species richness was positively related to abundance for recruits and residents. The effects of removing piscivorous fishes on the abundance of non-piscivorous fishes were similar for species considered separately. A greater number of species of recruit and resident fishes were more abundant on reefs from which predators had been removed. These data suggest that predators can play an important role in structuring communities of fishes on coral reefs.

AB The effect of long-term (1983-1988) applications of crop residues (millet straw, 2-4 t ha-1 yr-1) and/or mineral fertilizer (30 kg N, 13 kg P and 25 kg K ha-1 yr-1) on uptake of phosphorus (P) and other nutrients, root growth and mycorrhizal colonization of pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum L.) was examined for two seasons (1987 and 1988) on an acid sandy soil in Niger. Treatments of the long-term field experiment were: control (-CR-F), mineral fertilizer only (-CR+F), crop residues only (+CR-F), and crop residues plus mineral fertilizer (+CR+F).
   In both years, total P uptake was similar for +CR-F and -CR+F treatments (1.6-3.5 kg P ha-1), although available soil P concentration (Bray I P) was considerably lower in +CR-F (3.2 mg P kg-1 soil) than in -CR+F (7.4) soil. In the treatments with mineral fertilizers (-CR+F; +CR+F), crop residues increased available soil P concentrations (Bray I P) from 7.4 to 8.9 mg kg-1 soil, while total P uptake increased from 3.6 to 10.6 kg P ha-1. In 1987 (with 450 mm of rainfall), leaf P concentrations of 30-day-old millet plants were in the deficiency range, but highest in the +CR+F treatment. In 1988 (699 mm), leaf P concentrations were distinctly higher, and again highest in the +CR+F treatment. In the treatments without crop residues (-CR-F; -CR+F), potassium (K) concentrations in the leaves indicated K deficiency, while application of crop residues (+CR-F; +CR+F) substantially raised leaf K concentrations and total K uptake. Leaf concentrations of calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg) were hardly affected by the different treatments.
   In the topsoil (0-30 cm), root length density of millet plants was greater for +CR+F (6.5 cm cm-3) than for +CR-F (4.5 cm cm-3) and -CR+F (4.2 cm cm-3) treatments. Below 30 cm soil depth, root length density of all treatments declined rapidly from about 0.6 cm cm-3 (30-60 cm soil depth) to 0.2 cm cm-3 (120-180 cm soil depth). During the period of high uptake rates of P (42-80 DAP), root colonization with vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal (VAM) fungi was low in 1987 (15-20%), but distinctly higher in 1988 (55-60%). Higher P uptake of +CR+F plants was related to a greater total root length in 0-30 cm and also to a higher P uptake rate per unit root length (P influx). Beneficial effects of crop residues on P uptake were primarily attributed to higher P mobility in the soil due to decreased concentrations of exchangeable Al, and enhancement of root growth. In contrast, the beneficial effect of crop residues on K uptake was caused by direct K supply with the millet straw.

AB The concept of urban wilderness feels like a paradox since natural and urban environments have long been viewed as antithetical. Today, however, wilderness is high on the urban agenda as a response to different challenges: biodiversity and human experiences of nature are being lost in increasingly dense cities, while at the same time a plethora of wild areas are developing in cities that are undergoing post-industrial transformation. Yet there is confusion around the definitions and the anticipated functions of urban wilderness and how humans can be incorporated therein. A unifying framework is proposed here that envisions urban wilderness as a socialecological system; three major components are identified and linked: (i) the supply of wilderness areas along gradients of naturalness and ecological novelty, leading to a differentiation of ancient vs. novel wilderness, and the identification of wilderness components within cultural ecosystems; (ii) the demand for wilderness in urban societies, which differs among sociocultural groups as a function of underlying values and experiences; (iii) the access to urban wilderness, which can be improved both in terms of providing opportunities for encountering urban wilderness (e.g., by conserving, rewilding wilderness areas) and enhancing the orientation of urban people towards wilderness (e.g., through information, environmental education, citizen science). Evidence from urban wilderness projects in Europe demonstrates that multi-targeted approaches to conserving and managing existing novel urban ecosystems offer manifold opportunities to combine biodiversity conservation and wilderness experience in cities.

AB Cruel oil or green gold is a dilemma for the oil palm industry. The oil palm industry (planting and milling) has a devastating impact on the environment and ecosystems. Oil palm plantations and expansion cause deforestation, habitat loss, forest fragmentation, biodiversity loss, food chain disruption, soil property changes, water and air pollution, conversion of wetlands and arable lands, and increased greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, resulting in annual fires as well as increasing both subsidence and flood risk. Palm oil mill effluents (POME) are toxic compounds that cause eutrophication and acidification, pollute terrestrial and aquatic systems and release greenhouse gases. However, the oil palm industry is a million-dollar industry that ensures food security (oil and fat). There is increasing demand for palm oil due to population growth and for use as a biofuel feedstock. Significant higher production per hectare in comparison to other oil crops is the main advantage of oil palm. The anthropogenic pressure on the environment is increasing to fulfil the demand and increasing susceptibility to natural disasters. Therefore, the sustainability of this industry is an urgent need. This critical review identified gaps and researched ways for the oil palm industry to be sustainable. Maintaining ecological integrity (ecological health, connectivity, resilience); justifying land allocation (ecosystem service mapping); providing awareness, good management practices, no/minimum production gaps, high yield and disease resistant cultivar generation and plantations, supplemental forms of alternative sources, zero-waste milling technology; and locating plantations on suitable land without further deforestation can fulfil the oil palm industry's present and future demands without impairing the ecosystem or environment.

AB Microbial ecology provides insights into the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of microbial communities underpinning every ecosystem on Earth. Microbial communities can now be investigated in unprecedented detail, although there is still a wealth of open questions to be tackled. Here we identify 50 research questions of fundamental importance to the science or application of microbial ecology, with the intention of summarising the field and bringing focus to new research avenues. Questions are categorised into seven themes: host-microbiome interactions; health and infectious diseases; human health and food security; microbial ecology in a changing world; environmental processes; functional diversity; and evolutionary processes. Many questions recognise that microbes provide an extraordinary array of functional diversity that can be harnessed to solve real-world problems. Our limited knowledge of spatial and temporal variation in microbial diversity and function is also reflected, as is the need to integrate micro- and macro-ecological concepts, and knowledge derived from studies with humans and other diverse organisms. Although not exhaustive, the questions presented are intended to stimulate discussion and provide focus for researchers, funders and policy makers, informing the future research agenda in microbial ecology.

AB 1. The introduction and success of non-native species are both a consequence and a cause of rapid global change. Humans have created novel ecosystems through environmental modification and mass movements of organisms around the planet.
   2. It has been argued that species biogeographic origin cannot explain or predict ecological impacts and the origin of a species should not influence ecosystem management. This rejection of 'origin' is overly simplistic. Origin effects can arise through biased sampling of the types of species transported, the environmental and evolutionary context of their source environments and the communities and environments to which they are introduced. Differences in co-evolutionary histories between source and recipient environments, and adaptation of introduced species to modified environmental conditions, can also shape origin effects.
   3. The high rates and long distances of human-mediated dispersal have increased the sizes of regional species pools. In addition, human transported, non-native species can change the function of recipient ecosystems through changes to community composition. We outline how origin effects can cascade through to ecological impact at population, community and ecosystem levels.
   4. Synthesis. Non-native species can have predictable and preventable effects on recipient communities. We identify multiple sources of origin effects and describe the ecological and evolutionary pathways through which origin effects lead to impacts. This functional understanding of origin effects must include human actions. However, species origin should not, on its own, be used as a shortcut for management decisions; origin effects should instead feed into a process whereby ecologists work together with managers, policymakers and broader society to guide decisions on how to respond to the effects of non-native species.

AB Ecosystem services (ES) approaches to biodiversity conservation are currently high on the ecological research and policy agendas. However, despite a wealth of studies into biodiversity's role inmaintaining ES (B-ES relationships) across landscapes, we still lack generalities in the nature and strengths of these linkages. Reasons for this are manifold, but can largely be attributed to (i) a lack of adherence to definitions and thus a confusion between final ES and the ecosystem functions (EFs) underpinning them, (ii) a focus on uninformative biodiversity indices and singular hypotheses and (iii) top-down analyses across large spatial scales and overlooking of context-dependency. The biodiversity-ecosystem functioning (B-EF) field provides an alternate context for examining biodiversity's mechanistic role in shaping ES, focusing on species' characteristics that may drive EFs via multiple mechanisms across contexts. Despite acknowledgements of a need for B-ES research to look towards underlying B-EF linkages, the connections between these areas of research remains weak. With this review, we pull together recent B-EF findings to identify key areas for future developments in B-ES research. We highlight a means by which B-ES research may begin to identify how and when multiple underlying B-EF relationships may scale to final ES delivery and trade-offs.

AB Setting aside high-quality large areas of habitat to protect threatened populations is becoming increasingly difficult as humans fragment and degrade the environment. Biologists and managers therefore must determine the best way to shepherd small populations through the dual challenges of reductions in both the number of individuals and genetic variability. By bringing in additional individuals, threatened populations can be increased in size (demographic rescue) or provided with variation to facilitate adaptation and reduce inbreeding (genetic rescue). The relative strengths of demographic and genetic rescue for reducing extinction and increasing growth of threatened populations are untested, and which type of rescue is effective may vary with population size. Using the flour beetle (Tribolium castaneum) in a microcosm experiment, we disentangled the genetic and demographic components of rescue, and compared them with adaptation from standing genetic variation (evolutionary rescue in the strictest sense) using 244 experimental populations founded at either a smaller (50 individuals) or larger (150 individuals) size. Both types of rescue reduced extinction, and those effects were additive. Over the course of six generations, genetic rescue increased population sizes and intrinsic fitness substantially. Both large and small populations showed evidence of being able to adapt from standing genetic variation. Our results support the practice of genetic rescue in facilitating adaptation and reducing inbreeding depression, and suggest that demographic rescue alone may suffice in larger populations even if only moderately inbred individuals are available for addition.

AB AimTo identify characteristics of a human-modified landscape that promote taxonomic (TD), functional (FD) and phylogenetic (PD) dimensions of bat biodiversity.
   LocationCaribbean lowlands of northeastern Costa Rica.
   MethodsDuring the dry and wet seasons, we quantified TD (Simpson's diversity), as well as FD and PD (Rao's quadratic entropy) of phyllostomid bat assemblages at 15 sites that represented a forest loss and fragmentation gradient. FD was estimated separately for each of seven functional components that reflect particular niche axes (e.g. diet, foraging strategy) and for all functional components combined (FDall). PD was based on relatedness of species derived from a supertree. We identified the best explanatory landscape characteristics of each dimension using hierarchical partitioning.
   ResultsLandscape effects were dimension and season specific. During the dry season, TD and PD increased with increasing proportions of pasture or size of forest patches, whereas FDall decreased with increasing size of forest patches. During the wet season, TD increased with increasing forest patch size, whereas FDall and PD increased with increasing compactness of forest patches and decreasing proximity. Decomposition of FD into separate functional components revealed different landscape effects on ecological aspects of assemblages.
   Main conclusionsOne dimension of biodiversity was not a good surrogate for another. Rather, decomposition of biodiversity into different dimensions and functional components facilitated identification of the aspects of assemblages that are most affected by forest conversion and fragmentation. Areas with intermediate amounts of forest and pasture during the dry season harboured highest diversity from taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic perspectives. During the wet season, areas with large, compact forest patches promoted the dimensions of biodiversity. Placement of areas with even amounts of forest and pasture adjacent to large, compact forest patches (e.g. reserves) may maintain high biodiversity of bats and the ecosystem functions that they provide throughout the year.

AB Coccolithophores are one of the most abundant eukaryotic phytoplankton in the oceans and are distinguished by their ability to build calcitic platelets (coccoliths). Of the numerous species, Emiliania huxleyi is considered one of the major calcifiers in the pelagic ocean. There is growing concern that increasing levels of CO2 in the atmosphere and the subsequent acidification of the ocean may disrupt the production of coccoliths. Furthermore, any change in the global distribution and abundance of E. huxleyi relative to non-calcifying groups of phytoplankton (e. g. diatoms) will have important effects on the biogeochemical cycling of carbon and climatic feedbacks. We review different lines of evidence that suggest E. huxleyi is increasingly expanding its range into the polar oceans. These observations contribute to the debate on the climatic effects on natural coccolithophore populations. We postulate that E. huxleyi may be more sensitive to recent environmental changes such as increasing sea surface temperature and salinity than to changing ocean carbonate chemistry, partly because increased availability of CO2(aq) likely alleviates a carbon limitation for the inefficient Rubisco enzyme in these algae. Any potentially important climatic feedbacks of coccolithophores need a better knowledge of the mechanisms and rates of adaptation by natural populations. As more data and modelling work become available, the real significance of this poleward expansion will become clear.

AB Modeling the biogeographic consequences of climate change requires confidence in model predictions under novel conditions. However, models often fail when extended to new locales, and such instances have been used as evidence of a change in physiological tolerance, that is, a fundamental niche shift. We explore an alternative explanation and propose a method for predicting the likelihood of failure based on physiological performance curves and environmental variance in the original and new environments. We define the transient event margin (TEM) as the gap between energetic performance failure, defined as CTmax, and the upper lethal limit, defined as LTmax. If TEM is large relative to environmental fluctuations, models will likely fail in new locales. If TEM is small relative to environmental fluctuations, models are likely to be robust for new locales, even when mechanism is unknown. Using temperature, we predict when biogeographic models are likely to fail and illustrate this with a case study. We suggest that failure is predictable from an understanding of how climate drives nonlethal physiological responses, but for many species such data have not been collected. Successful biogeographic forecasting thus depends on understanding when the mechanisms limiting distribution of a species will differ among geographic regions, or at different times, resulting in realized niche shifts. TEM allows prediction of the likelihood of such model failure.

AB Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi are ubiquitous symbionts of higher plants in terrestrial ecosystems, while the occurrence of the AM symbiosis is influenced by a complex set of abiotic and biotic factors. To reveal the regional distribution pattern of AM fungi as driven by multiple environmental factors, and to understand the ecological importance of AM fungi in natural ecosystems, we conducted a field investigation on AM fungal abundance along environmental gradients in the arid and semi-arid grasslands of northern China. In addition to plant parameters recorded in situ, soil samples were collected, and soil chemo-physical and biological parameters were measured in the lab. Statistical analyses were performed to reveal the relative contribution of climatic, edaphic and vegetation factors to AM fungal abundance, especially for extraradical hyphal length density (HLD) in the soil. The results indicated that HLD were positively correlated with mean annual temperature (MAT), soil clay content and soil pH, but negatively correlated with both soil organic carbon (SOC) and soil available N. The multiple regressions and structural equation model showed that MAT was the key positive contributor and soil fertility was the key negative contributor to HLD. Furthermore, both the intraradical AM colonization (IMC) and relative abundance of AM fungi, which was quantified by real-time PCR assay, tended to decrease along the increasing SOC content. With regard to the obvious negative correlation between MAT and SOC in the research area, the positive correlation between MAT and HLD implied that AM fungi could potentially mitigate soil carbon losses especially in infertile soils under global warming. However, direct evidence from long-term experiments is still expected to support the AM fungal contribution to soil carbon pools.

AB Assisted colonisation has received considerable attention recently, and the risks and benefits of introducing taxa to sites beyond their historical range have been vigorously debated. The debate has primarily focused on using assisted colonization to enhance the persistence of taxa that would otherwise be stranded in unsuitable habitat as a consequence of anthropogenic climate change and habitat fragmentation. However, a complementary motivation for assisted colonisation could be to relocate taxa to restore declining ecosystem processes that support biodiversity in recipient sites. We compare the benefits and risks of species introductions motivated by either goal, which we respectively term 'push' versus 'pull' strategies for introductions to preserve single species or for restoration of ecological processes. We highlight that, by focusing on push and neglecting pull options, ecologists have greatly under-estimated potential benefits and risks that may result from assisted colonisation. Assisted colonisation may receive higher priority in climate change adaptation strategies if relocated taxa perform valuable ecological functions (pull) rather than have little collateral benefit (push). Potential roles include enhancing resistance to invasion by undesired species, supporting co-dependent species, performing keystone functions, providing temporally critical resources, replacing taxa of low ecological redundancy, and avoiding time lags in the provisioning of desired functions.

AB Terrestrial long-distance migrations are declining globally: in North America, nearly 75% have been lost. Yet there has been limited research comparing habitat suitability and connectivity models to identify migration corridors across increasingly fragmented landscapes. Here we use pronghorn (Antilocapra americana) migrations in prairie habitat to compare two types of models that identify habitat suitability: maximum entropy (Maxent) and expert-based (Analytic Hierarchy Process). We used distance to wells, distance to water, NDVI, land cover, distance to roads, terrain shape and fence presence to parameterize the models. We then used the output of these models as cost surfaces to compare two common connectivity models, least-cost modeling (LCM) and circuit theory. Using pronghorn movement data from spring and fall migrations, we identified potential migration corridors by combining each habitat suitability model with each connectivity model. The best performing model combination was Maxent with LCM corridors across both seasons. Maxent out-performed expert-based habitat suitability models for both spring and fall migrations. However, expert-based corridors can perform relatively well and are a cost-effective alternative if species location data are unavailable. Corridors created using LCM out-performed circuit theory, as measured by the number of pronghorn GPS locations present within the corridors. We suggest the use of a tiered approach using different corridor widths for prioritizing conservation and mitigation actions, such as fence removal or conservation easements.

AB Sampling animal populations with camera traps has become increasingly popular over the past two decades, particularly for species that are cryptic, elusive, exist at low densities or range over large areas. The results have been widely used to estimate population size and density. We analyzed data from 13 camera trap surveys conducted at five sites across the Kaa-Iya landscape, Bolivian Chaco, for jaguar, puma, ocelot and lowland tapir. We compared two spatially explicit capturerecapture (SCR) software packages: secr, a likelihood-based approach, and SPACECAP, a Bayesian approach, both of which are implemented within the R environment and can be used to estimate animal density from photographic records of individual animals that simultaneously employ spatial information about the capture location relative to the sample location. As a non-spatial analysis, we used the program CAPTURE 2 to estimate abundance from the capturerecapture records of individuals identified through camera trap photos combined with an ad hoc estimation of the effective survey area to estimate density. SCR methods estimated jaguar population densities from 0.31 to 1.82 individuals per 100?km2 across the Kaa-Iya sites; puma from 0.36 to 7.99; ocelot from 1.67 to 51.7; and tapir from 7.38 to 42.9. Density estimates using either secr or SPACECAP were generally lower than the estimates generated using the non-spatial method for all surveys and species; and density estimates using SPACECAP were generally lower than that using secr. We recommend using either secr or SPACECAP because the spatially explicit methods are not biased by an informal estimation of an effective survey area. Although SPACECAP and secr are less sensitive than non-spatial methods to the size of the grid used for sampling, we recommend grid sizes several times larger than the average home range (known or estimated) of the target species.

TI Natural Capital, Ecosystem Services, and Soil Change: Why Soil Science
   Must Embrace an Ecosystems Approach
SO VADOSE ZONE JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
ID FRAMEWORK; DEFINITION; QUALITY
AB Soil is part of the Earth's life support system, but how should we convey the value of this and of soil as a resource? Consideration of the ecosystem services and natural capital of soils offers a framework going beyond performance indicators of soil health and quality, and recognizes the broad value that soil contributes to human wellbeing. This approach provides links and synergies between soil science and other disciplines such as ecology, hydrology, and economics, recognizing the importance of soils alongside other natural resources in sustaining the functioning of the Earth system. We articulate why an ecosystems approach is important for soil science in the context of natural capital, ecosystem services, and soil change. Soil change is defined as change on anthropogenic time scales and is an important way of conveying dynamic changes occurring in soils that are relevant to current political decision-making time scales. We identify four important areas of research: (i) framework development; (ii) quantifying the soil resource, stocks, fluxes, transformations, and identifying indicators; (iii) valuing the soil resource for its ecosystem services; and (iv) developing decision-support tools. Furthermore, we propose contributions that soil science can make to address these research challenges.

Restoration of habitat is necessary to achieve biodiversity conservation goals but often it is a costly and time-intensive process. Prioritization of where and when habitat is restored can help to ensure the cost-effective delivery of desired outcomes.
   2. We develop a restoration prioritization decision support tool to identify the combination of restoration sites and the schedule for their implementation most likely to deliver the greatest utility for a fixed budget and operational constraints. We use a case study to apply our prioritization approach in order to illustrate the data that can be employed to parameterise the analysis and the outputs that are able to inform restoration planning. We compare restoration schedules under alternative utility functions to demonstrate trade-offs associated with different objectives, assumptions and preferences for particular outcomes.
   3. Our prioritization approach is spatially and temporally explicit and accounts for the costs and benefits of restoration, the likelihood of restoration success, the probability of stochastic events, feedbacks, time lags and spatial connectivity.
   4. Through collaboration with restoration practitioners we derive quantitative and spatially explicit data on each site requiring restoration. We determine the relative priority for restoring each site and develop a restoration schedule over 20 years.
   5. Our results showed that after 20 years a little over a half of the sites requiring restoration are likely be successfully restored, while the total expenditure at our site will be c. US$13 center dot 7 million - almost the entire budget of $14 million.
   6. Synthesis and applications. Our restoration prioritization approach provides a schedule for where and when restoration should occur, and also provides operational guidance and support for cost-effective restoration planning such as informing the likely total cost of restoration.

AB Hydrological classification constitutes the first step of a new holistic framework for developing regional environmental flow criteria: the "Ecological Limits of Hydrologic Alteration (ELOHA)". The aim of this study was to develop a classification for 390 stream sections of the Segura River Basin based on 73 hydrological indices that characterize their natural flow regimes. The hydrological indices were calculated with 25 years of natural monthly flows (1980/81-2005/06) derived from a rainfall-runoff model developed by the Spanish Ministry of Environment and Public Works. These indices included, at a monthly or annual basis, measures of duration of droughts and central tendency and dispersion of flow magnitude (average, low and high flow conditions). Principal Component Analysis (PCA) indicated high redundancy among most hydrological indices, as well as two gradients: flow magnitude for mainstream rivers and temporal variability for tributary streams. A classification with eight flow-regime classes was chosen as the most easily interpretable in the Segura River Basin, which was supported by ANOSIM analyses. These classes can be simplified in 4 broader groups, with different seasonal discharge pattern: large rivers, perennial stable streams, perennial seasonal streams and intermittent and ephemeral streams. They showed a high degree of spatial cohesion, following a gradient associated with climatic aridity from NW to SE, and were well defined in terms of the fundamental variables in Mediterranean streams: magnitude and temporal variability of flows. Therefore, this classification is a fundamental tool to support water management and planning in the Segura River Basin. Future research will allow us to study the flow alteration-ecological response relationship for each river type, and set the basis to design scientifically credible environmental flows following the ELOHA framework.

AB Regional systematic conservation planning is an effective approach to marine protected area (MPA) network design, ensuring complementarity, and functional connectivity of areas. However, regional planning and local conservation actions do not properly inform one another. One outcome is the failure of regional designs to guide conservation actions. Another is that site-based MPAs constitute collections rather than functional systems for marine conservation. Understanding decisions related to spatial scale in conservation planning is essential for the development of ecologically functional networks of MPAs. Decisions about scale require that planners address trade-offs between the respective advantages and limitations of different considerations in several parts of the planning process. We provide the first comprehensive review of decisions about spatial scale that influence planning outcomes. We illustrate these decisions and the trade-offs involved with planning exercises undertaken in the Coral Triangle. We provide a framework in which decisions about spatial scale can be made explicit and investigated further. The framework helps to link theory and application in conservation planning, facilitates learning, and promotes the application of conservation actions that are both regionally and locally significant.

AB We used a field experiment, population modeling, and an analysis of 30 years of data from walleye (Sander vitreus;afreshwater fish) in Lake Erie to show that maternal influences on offspring survival can affect population dynamics. We first demonstrate experimentally that the survival of juvenile walleye increases with egg size (and, to a lesser degree, female energy reserves). Because egg size in this species tends to increase with maternal age, we then model these maternal influences on offspring survival as a function of maternal age to show that adult age structure can affect the maximum rate at which a population can produce new adults. Consistent with this hypothesis, we present empirical evidence that the maximum reproductive rate of an exploited population of walleye was approximately twice as high when older females were abundant as compared to when they were relatively scarce. Taken together, these results indicate that age- or size-based maternal influences on offspring survival can be an important mechanism driving population dynamics and that exploited populations could benefit from management strategies that protect, rather than target, reproductively valuable individuals.

AB Phenological data have shown an increase of ca. 10 days in European growing season length in the latter part of the twentieth century. In general, these changes have been associated with global warming. Here we present a study of thermal growing season (GS) trends in the Greater Baltic Area, northern Europe. Yearly dates for the start, end and length of the GS were computed for 49 stations in the studied area, using daily mean temperature measurements. Trends and tendencies of the GS parameters were analysed within the twentieth century. We also examined GS trends in long records (starting before 1850) from the region. The results show a general increase of the length of the GS of ca one week since 1951 in the area, where the most considerable change has occurred in spring (starting similar to 6 days earlier). The largest increases were found at stations adjacent to the Baltic Sea and North Sea, where some Danish stations showed significant increasing trends in the length of the GS of more than 20 days. The only tendency for a shorter GS was found in Archangelsk, north western Russia. The three longest records displayed large inter-annual and decadal variability, with tendencies for increased frequencies of longer growing seasons since the 1950s.

AB The spatial genetic structure of Martino's vole, a rare palaeoendemic species of the western Balkans, was investigated using DNA isolated from archived museum samples. The study was based on partial sequencing (555 bp) of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene for 63 specimens from 20 different localities throughout the species' range. Three highly divergent allopatric phylogenetic lineages (Northwestern, Central and Southeastern) were recognized among 47 haplotypes, suggesting three independent glacial differentiation centres within the western Balkans. The Northwestern lineage, which showed the highest divergence from all other samples (mean sequence divergence of 6.64% +/- 1.10), comprised samples collected from northwest of the Neretva River in Croatia, western Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Central and Southeastern lineages were separated by an average sequence divergence of 2.95% +/- 0.66 and were geographically divided by the Drim River (the Kosovo Basin in Serbia). Overall, haplotype diversity decreased from the Northwestern lineage to the Central and subsequently the Southeastern lineage, in a geographical pattern consistent with a stepping stone colonization. The observed distribution indicates a gradual southerly expansion with subsequent allopatry across the Neretva River and Drim River approximately 1 and 0.3 million years ago, respectively. Such a scenario is concordant with palaeontological evidence. Several highly divergent sublineages within the Northwestern and Central lineages showed no significant geographical structuring, suggesting secondary contact of allopatrically evolved lineages. We hypothesize that the topographical complexity of the Balkans promoted allopatry and isolation on a small geographical scale during interglacial periods, with secondary contact during glacial maxima. Furthermore, the three main lineages should be regarded as evolutionary significant units with important implications for conservation. Ecological data show that the Northwestern lineage in particular fulfils all criteria for a highly endangered, evolutionarily significant unit.

AB Orobanche crenata (broomrape) is an important constraint to pea (Pisum sativum) cultivation in the Mediterranean area, because little resistance is available in commercial crop varieties. Field experiments have demonstrated that some resistance is present in a number of P. sativum and P. fulvum accessions. The goal of this work was to characterize such resistance. The Pisum-O. crenata interaction and the resistance symptoms were studied under controlled conditions by using Petri dish and polyethylene bag assays. The content of phenolics and peroxidase activity in host tissue from infected and non-infected plants were also measured. Resistance and avoidance mechanisms, acting at different developmental stages of the parasite, have been identified, including low stimulation of O. crenata seed germination, unsuccessful penetration of host roots, delay in post-attachment tubercle development and necrosis of the attached tubercles. Infection caused an increase in the content of total soluble phenolics in some Pisum genotypes. Peroxidase activity was higher in resistant than in susceptible accessions. Results obtained with different Pisum genotypes showed that resistance is the result of several mechanisms acting at different stages of the infection process. Resistance is also related to increased levels of peroxidase activity in host roots.

AB Relative to the northern hemisphere, little is known about the effect of climate change on southern hemisphere birds, although the impact could be significant. Here we review the effects of climate change on birds that have been documented or predicted, with particular reference to Australian species. Potential impacts include changes in geographic range, movement patterns, morphology, physiology, abundance, phenology and community composition. The evidence suggests that these changes are already happening, both overseas and in Australia, but more research is needed to determine the extent of these impacts and how to conserve birds in the face of climate change. Management options include promoting adaptation and resilience, intensive management of sensitive species, and improved planning for mitigation techniques and monitoring.

AB We present a phylogenetic analysis of relationships among members of the Amazona ochrocephala species complex of parrots, a broadly distributed group in Middle and South America that has been a "taxonomic headache." Mitochondrial DNA sequence data are used to infer phylogenetic relationships among most of the named subspecies in the complex. Sequence-based phylogenies show that Middle American subspecies included in the analysis are reciprocally monophyletic, but subspecies described for South America do not reflect patterns of genetic variation. Samples from the lower Amazon cluster with samples collected in western Amazonia-not with samples from Colombia and Venezuela, as was predicted by subspecies classification. All subspecies of the complex are more closely related to one another than to other Amazona species, and division of the complex into three species (A. ochrocephala, A. auropalliata, and A. oratrix) is not supported by our data. Divergence-date estimates suggest that these parrots arrived in Middle America after the Panama land-bridge formed, and then expanded and diversified rapidly. As in Middle America, diversification of the group in South America occurred during the Pleistocene, possibly driven by changes in distribution of forest habitat.

AB Mass losses of oak leaves were studied in microcosms, where numbers of aquatic hyphomycete species (1-5) and nutrient concentrations (2 levels each of N, P, and Ca) were varied. Species numbers, species identities, N, P and N x P interactions all had significant effects on leaf mass loss, but the magnitude of the effect was greater for N and P than for species numbers. Mass loss in multicultures was greater than predicted from average contributions of the component species in single cultures. This may have been due to sampling effects or niche complementarity.

AB Populations of the marble trout (Salmo marmoratus) have declined critically due to introgression by brown trout (Salmo trutta) strains. In order to define strategies for long-term conservation, we examined the genetic structure of the 8 known pure populations using 15 microsatellite loci. The analyses reveal extraordinarily strong genetic differentiation among populations separated by < 15 km, and extremely low levels of intrapopulation genetic variability. As natural recolonization seems highly unlikely, appropriate management and conservation strategies should comprise the reintroduction of pure populations from mixed stocks (translocation) to avoid further loss of genetic diversity.

AB Woody plants are commonly fertilized in ornamental landscapes, based in part on the rationale that fertilization enhances pest resistance. However, a critical evaluation of evidence finds little to support this claim. Rather, many studies have found that fertilization decreased woody plant resistance to spider mites, sap sucking insects, mandibulate folivores, subcortical feeding insects, and browsing mammals by enhancing the nutritional quality of the plant and/or decreasing secondary metabolite concentrations. The growth/differentiation balance hypothesis (GDBH) postulates a physiological trade-off between growth and secondary metabolism, and predicts a parabolic response of secondary metabolism to variation in nutrient availability. Specifically, fertilization of moderately nutrient-deficient plants is predicted to decrease secondary metabolism if growth is increased but photosynthesis is not affected. However, fertilization of extremely nutrient-limited plants is predicted to increase secondary metabolism if photosynthesis is also increased. A number of studies have found fertilization to increase growth and decrease secondary metabolism. A few studies on extremely nutrient-deficient sites found fertilization to increase foliar secondary metabolism, but insect performance was not affected, possibly because increased foliar nitrogen counteracted effects of secondary metabolites on host quality. These studies, while consistent with the GDBH, do not represent adequate tests because none measured effects of fertilization on photosynthesis as well as growth. Only a few studies have addressed effects of fertilization on the ability of woody plants to tolerate herbivory, and all found fertilization to have no effect. The entrenched paradigm that fertilization enhances the insect resistance of woody plants in ornamental landscapes needs to be reassessed.

AB Until recently, phyloggenetic analyses have been routinely based on homologous sequences of a single gene, Given the vast number of gene sequences now available, phylogenetic studies are now based on the analysis of multiple genes. Thus, it has become necessary to devise statistical methods to combine multiple molecular data sets. Here, we compare several models for combining different genes for the purpose of evaluating the likelihood of tree topologies. Three methods of branch length estimation were studied: assuming all genes have the same branch lengths (concatenate model), assuming that branch lengths are proportional among genes (proportional model), or assuming that each gene has a separate set of branch lengths (separate model). We also compared three models of among-site rate variation: the homogenous model, a model that assumes one gamma parameter for all genes, and a model that assumes one gamma parameter for each gene. On the basis of two nuclear and one mitochondrial amino acid data sets, our results suggest that, depending on the data set chosen, either the separate model or the proportional model represents the most appropriate method for branch length analysis. For all the data sets examined, one gamma parameter for each gene represents the best model for among-site rate variation, Using these models we analyzed alternative mammalian tree topologies, and we describe the effect of the assumed model on the maximum likelihood tree. We show that the choice of the model has an impact on the best phylogeny obtained.

AB Earthworms are a major component of many terrestrial ecosystems. By modifying decomposition processes and soil structure, they function as driving factors of the soil microbial community. Using microcosms, we investigated the effects of the presence and community composition of earthworms on the in situ respiratory response of a microbial community to an array of organic substrates including carbohydrates, amino acids, a polymer and an amide. Both the actual in situ catabolic response of non-growing microorganisms and the potential response of growing microorganisms were investigated. Three questions were studied: (1) does the presence of one of the main functional groups of earthworms (endogeic species) affect microbial community functioning; (2) does the presence of two functional groups (endogeic and epigeic species) alter microbial community functioning; (3) does the number of species within functional groups matter. The presence of endogeic earthworms significantly reduced microbial biomass and affected the physiological profile and functioning of the microbial community. In contrast, in the presence of endo- and epigeic species microbial biomass was not reduced significantly, indicating that epigeic species counteracted the effect of endogeic species. The physiological profile of the microbial community significantly differed between the treatment with endogeic species only and the treatment with both endo- and epigeic species. Also, the physiological profile of the microbial community was significantly affected by the number of species per functional group, which at least in part may have been caused by a sampling effect. Overall, the actual in situ catabolic response of non-growing microorganisms appears to be more sensitive than the potential response of growing microorganisms. In addition, the direction of the actual response (negative) was diametrically opposed to that of the potential response (positive). We conclude that the catabolic response of growing microorganisms does not reflect the actual case in situ. For earthworms, loss in both species number and functional group number has the potential to change soil microbial community functioning.
