AB AimThe Panama Canal expansion, scheduled for completion in 2015, is expected to have major effects on commercial shipping and port operations throughout the world, with potential consequences for the transfer and establishment of non-indigenous species that remain largely unexplored. We developed a series of scenario-based models to examine how shipping traffic patterns may change after expansion and consider possible implications for species transfers and invasion dynamics in the USA.
   LocationCoastal USA, excluding Alaska and Hawaii
   MethodsUsing a Monte Carlo simulation approach, we predicted changes in discharged ballast water, wetted surface area of ship hulls and frequency of ship arrivals modelled under scenarios that are based on (1) current shipping patterns from the western Pacific Rim to the USA, (2) estimates of fleet expansion and (3) diversion of traffic away from the US West Coast through the Panama Canal.
   ResultsDuring the 5-year period following canal expansion (2015-2019), our models estimated that the Gulf and East coasts would receive 78% and 99% median increases in total ballast discharge and 172% and 182% increases in total wetted surface area, respectively. For the West Coast, our models estimated 9.6% median decreases in both total ballast discharge and wetted surface area. We further predict that many ports in the Gulf and East coasts will receive up to three times the current number of arrivals and increased ballast water discharge, from this region after expansion.
   Main conclusionsOur scenario-based analysis provides a first estimate for increases in frequency, magnitude and spatial distribution of exposure that the Gulf and East coasts will experience due to ships and ballast arriving from the western Pacific, following the canal expansion. If organisms transported via ballast water or ship hulls are able to survive transit of the canal, the predictions suggest increased likelihood of introduction along these coasts by species originating in the western Pacific.

AB Many fruit trees undergo cycles of heavy fruit load (ON-Crop) in one year, followed by low fruit load (OFF-Crop) the following year, a phenomenon known as alternate bearing (AB). The mechanism by which fruit load affects flowering induction during the following year (return bloom) is still unclear. Although not proven, it is commonly accepted that the fruit or an organ which senses fruit presence generates an inhibitory signal that moves into the bud and inhibits apical meristem transition. Indeed, fruit removal from ON-Crop trees (de-fruiting) induces return bloom. Identification of regulatory or metabolic processes modified in the bud in association with altered fruit load might shed light on the nature of the AB signalling process. The bud transcriptome of de-fruited citrus trees was compared with those of ON- and OFF-Crop trees. Fruit removal resulted in relatively rapid changes in global gene expression, including induction of photosynthetic genes and proteins. Altered regulatory mechanisms included abscisic acid (ABA) metabolism and auxin polar transport. Genes of ABA biosynthesis were induced; however, hormone analyses showed that the ABA level was reduced in OFF-Crop buds and in buds shortly following fruit removal. Additionally, genes associated with Ca2+-dependent auxin polar transport were remarkably induced in buds of OFF-Crop and de-fruited trees. Hormone analyses showed that auxin levels were reduced in these buds as compared with ON-Crop buds. In view of the auxin transport autoinhibition theory, the possibility that auxin distribution plays a role in determining bud fate is discussed.

AB Habitat loss is a leading cause of biodiversity loss in terrestrial ecosystems. For marine species that rely on acoustic cues to navigate, find food or select mates, sound is a key element of their environment. Chronic forms of human-generated ocean noise have the potential to mask communication signals over substantial fractions of their functional areas for substantial fractions of the year, which makes acoustic masking a qualitatively similar stressor to habitat loss. International policy decisions on chronic ocean noise are evolving, which creates an opportunity to advance the scientific foundation of decision-making. We measured ocean noise levels at 12 sites, chosen for current and predicted intensities of anthropogenic activities and importance to three endangered whale species in Canada's Pacific Ocean: fin, humpback and killer whales. Canada includes sound as a key element of resident killer whale critical habitat, but not for other species. In the frequency bands that killer whales use for social communication, noise levels were highest in legally designated killer whale critical habitats. In contrast, noise levels were generally lower in habitats known to be important for baleen whales, but these quieter areas are not yet given special legal protection. These noise levels translate into potentially serious fractions of lost opportunities for acoustic communication. Median noise levels are high enough to reduce the communication spaces for fin, humpback and killer whales under typical (median) conditions by 1, 52 and 62%, respectively, and 30, 94 and 97% under noisy conditions. As countries begin to articulate their policies to protect acoustic attributes of marine habitats under their jurisdiction, we recommend quantifying loss of communication space, but quantitative targets need to be set. We see two ways forward. Managers could specify limits of acceptable change in terms of population-level impacts, which can be modelled through effects from communication masking and/or disturbance on prey intake. Alternatively, managers can specify targets reflecting amount of habitat to protect for each species, adjusting upward to account for habitat effectively lost from chronic ocean noise.

AB Aim Our aims were to identify centres of endemism and to infer whether these areas have functioned as refugia for subtropical rain forest plants through historical climate fluctuations.
   Location Subtropical eastern Australia (23-33 degrees S; 145-155 degrees E).
   Methods We collated 25,000 records of 179 endemic rain forest plants to identify geographical areas with unusually high concentrations of endemic taxa and range-restricted endemics. We then tested whether centres of endemism coincide with other features indicating refugia, including habitat stability over 120,000 years, and we related dispersal patterns to past habitat stability using seed weight as a surrogate for dispersal ability of endemic plant taxa.
   Results We identified five main centres of endemism. Historical stability and other processes affecting diversity, including current rainfall, rain forest area, and topographic complexity, explained 58% of variation in plant-weighted endemism. Taxa with poor dispersal ability were concentrated in the areas that were most stable historically.
   Main conclusions Several lines of evidence suggest that centres of endemism have functioned as important refugia for subtropical rain forest taxa through historical climate fluctuations. The highest concentrations of range-restricted endemic species occur in locations that are predicted to have maintained stable rain forest habitat over at least the past 120,000 years. This association was independent from other factors that were expected to promote diversity (i.e. rain forest area and current environmental suitability). These locations have disproportionately high concentrations of species with poor dispersal ability (large-seeded species).

AB Protection of groundwater-dependent ecosystems (GDEs) is an important criterion in sustainable groundwater management, particularly when human water consumption is in competition with environmental water demands; however, the delineation of GDEs is commonly a challenging task. The Groundwater-dependent Ecosystem Mapping (GEM) method proposed here is based on interpretation of the land surface response to the drying process derived from combined changes in two multispectral indices, the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index and the Normalised Difference Wetness Index, both derived from Landsat imagery. The GEM method predicts three land cover classes used for delineation of potential GDEs: vegetation with permanent access to groundwater; vegetation with diminishing access to groundwater; and water bodies that can persist through a prolonged dry period. The method was applied to a study site in the Ellen Brook region of Western Australia, where a number of GDEs associated with localised groundwater, diffuse discharge zones, and riparian vegetation were known. The estimated accuracy of the method indicated a good agreement between the predicted and known GDEs; Producer's accuracy was calculated as up to 91% for some areas. The method is most applicable for mapping GDEs in regions with a distinct drying period. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Identification of refugia is an increasingly important adaptation strategy in conservation planning under rapid anthropogenic climate change. Granite outcrops (GOs) provide extraordinary diversity, including a wide range of taxa, vegetation types and habitats in the Southwest Australian Floristic Region (SWAFR). However, poor characterization of GOs limits the capacity of conservation planning for refugia under climate change. A novel means for the rapid identification of potential refugia is presented, based on the assessment of local-scale environment and vegetation structure in a wider region. This approach was tested on GOs across the SWAFR. Airborne discrete return Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) data and Red Green and Blue (RGB) imagery were acquired. Vertical vegetation profiles were used to derive 54 structural classes. Structural vegetation types were described in three areas for supervised classification of a further 13 GOs across the region. Habitat descriptions based on 494 vegetation plots on and around these GOs were used to quantify relationships between environmental variables, ground cover and canopy height. The vegetation surrounding GOs is strongly related to structural vegetation types (Kappa = 0.8) and to its spatial context. Water gaining sites around GOs are characterized by taller and denser vegetation in all areas. The strong relationship between rainfall, soil-depth, and vegetation structure (R 2 of 0.8-0.9) allowed comparisons of vegetation structure between current and future climate. Significant shifts in vegetation structural types were predicted and mapped for future climates. Water gaining areas below granite outcrops were identified as important putative refugia. A reduction in rainfall may be offset by the occurrence of deeper soil elsewhere on the outcrop. However, climate change interactions with fire and water table declines may render our conclusions conservative. The LiDAR-based mapping approach presented enables the integration of site-based biotic assessment with structural vegetation types for the rapid delineation and prioritization of key refugia.

AB Increased interest in indigenous ecological knowledge (IEK) has led to concern that it is vulnerable amidst social and ecological change. In response, multiple authors have recommended the establishment of programs for the maintenance and revitalization of IEK systems. However, few studies have analyzed the methods, opportunities, and challenges of these programs. This is a critical gap, as IEK maintenance is challenging and will require layered and evidence-based solutions. We seek to build a foundation for future approaches to IEK maintenance. First, we present a systematic literature review of IEK maintenance programs (n = 39) and discuss the opportunities and challenges inherent in five broad groups of published approaches. Second, we use two case studies from the Republic of Vanuatu to illustrate these challenges in more depth. The first case study takes a community-based approach, which has inherent strengths (e. g., localized organization). It has, however, faced practical (e. g., funding) and epistemological (changing modes of knowledge transmission) challenges. The second case study seeks to facilitate IEK transmission within the formal school system. Although this model has potential, it has faced significant challenges (e. g., lack of institutional linkages). We conclude that supporting and strengthening IEK is important but that serious attention is needed to account for the social, situated, and dynamic nature of IEK. In closing, we use the review and case studies to propose four principles that may guide adaptive and flexible approaches for the future maintenance of IEK systems.

AB Understanding how fire weather danger indices changed in the past and how such changes affected forest fire activity is important in a changing climate. We used the Canadian Fire Weather Index (FWI), calculated from two reanalysis data sets, ERA-40 and ERA Interim, to examine the temporal variation of forest fire danger in Europe in 1960-2012. Additionally, we used national forest fire statistics from Greece, Spain and Finland to examine the relationship between fire danger and fires. There is no obvious trend in fire danger for the time period covered by ERA-40 (1960-1999), whereas for the period 1980-2012 covered by ERA Interim, the mean FWI shows an increasing trend for southern and eastern Europe which is significant at the 99% confidence level. The cross correlations calculated at the national level in Greece, Spain and Finland between total area burned and mean FWI of the current season is of the order of 0.6, demonstrating the extent to which the current fire-season weather can explain forest fires. To summarize, fire risk is multifaceted, and while climate is a major determinant, other factors can contribute to it, either positively or negatively.

AB This paper examines the integration of landscape connectivity and ecosystem services. It is based on the assumption that if a habitat within a landscape has a more significant role in connecting with other habitats, it would have a higher ecosystem services value for biodiversity conservation. The Shenzhen River watershed, a cross-border region shared by the city of Shenzhen and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region in China, was used as a case study. An area-based functional connectivity index, known as the possibility of connectivity (PC), was implemented to examine the temporal and spatial dynamics of the value of ecosystem services for biodiversity conservation over the period from 1988 to 2008. To evaluate the effectiveness of the PC index, a comparison was made between the conventional assessment method for ecosystem services and the proposed method. Results suggest that our proposed method can identify significant reduction of ecosystem services that was not only due to the decrease of habitat size, but also caused by the damage of connectivity among habitat patches. Also, it can identify sites which should have a high priority in restoring the ecosystem services for biodiversity conservation. In conclusion, this study provides a way to consider landscape connectivity in the evaluation of ecosystem services which is essential for landscape planning and nature conservation.

AB Hydroponic experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of low nitrogen (N) nutrition on photosynthesis and its relationships with N status in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Two wheat cultivars, Zaoyangmai and Yangmai158, differing in low N nutrition tolerances, were used. The results show that under low N nutrition the area of the first top leaf was significantly reduced, while there was no significant difference in the top second and third leaf areas compared with the control for either cultivar. The net photosynthetic rate and chlorophyll content were significantly reduced in the top three leaves of Zaoyangmai, while no significant difference in these factors was observed in the top first and second leaves of Yangmai158 compared with control under N-limited conditions. The effective quantum yield of photosystem II (PSII) photochemistry and the maximal quantum yield of PSII photochemistry were only slightly altered in both cultivars, indicating that PSII was not damaged by low N nutrition. In addition, the non-photochemical quenching coefficient increased significantly in the top three leaves of Zaoyangmai, and only in the top third leaf of Yangmai158 under N-limited conditions. Furthermore, the ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) and soluble protein contents decreased significantly in the top second and third leaves of Zaoyangmai, while no significant difference was observed in the top first and second leaves of Yangmai158 between low N nutrition and control. We concluded that in Yangmai158, N status changed less, and it maintained almost normal photosynthesis in young leaves, thus Yangmai158 could be more tolerance to low N nutrition.

AB The investigation of flow-ecology relationships constitutes the basis for the development of environmental flow criteria. The need to understand hydrology-ecology linkages in natural systems has increased owing to the prospect of climate change and flow regime management, especially in water-scarce areas such as Mediterranean basins. Our research quantified the macroinvertebrate community response at family, genus and species level to natural flow regime dynamics in freshwater streams of a Mediterranean semiarid basin (Segura River, SE Spain) and identified the flow components that influence the composition and richness of biotic assemblages. Flow stability and minimum flows were the principal hydrological drivers of macroinvertebrate assemblages, whereas the magnitude of average and maximum flows had a limited effect. Perennial stable streams were characterized by flow sensitive lotic taxa (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera) and intermittent streams by predominately lentic taxa (Odonata, Coleoptera, Heteroptera and Diptera). Relatively minor biological changes were recorded for intermediate flow regime classes along a gradient of flow stability. Seasonal variation and minimum flows are key hydrological components that need to be considered for river management and environmental flows in the Segura River basin and other Mediterranean basins. The anthropogenic modification of these parameters, due to both human activities and climate change, would probably lead to significant changes in the structure and composition of communities in perennial stable streams. This would be characterized by a reduction of flow sensitive Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera taxa and an increase in more resilient Odonata, Coleoptera, Heteroptera and Diptera taxa.

AB Questions Which plant traits characterize successful and failed target species in urban grassland restoration? Do traits of successful target species differ from those of resident species? How do plant traits relate to environmental constraints? Location In-situ experimental sites on wastelands in shrinking residential areas in Berlin, Germany. Methods We established grassland restoration treatments and explored plant traits of successful and failed target species (plant height, specific leaf area, seed mass, seed shape, seed longevity index, CSR strategy type, plant life form). To shed light on mechanisms that shape restoration success, we also analysed the same traits of species originating from the soil seed bank and species immigrating from the surroundings. We compared both trait sets to those of resident species. With RLQ analyses we related the trait data to abundance data of species and to variables describing the environmental setting of the sites. Results In the third year after treatment, several plant traits differed between the successful or failed target species and the resident vegetation, e.g. successful target species tended to be as tall as resident species, whereas failed target species were smaller, suggesting insufficient competitive ability of the latter. Species that successfully recruited from the soil seed bank were taller than resident species. Small specific leaf area was important for the establishment success of target species. Trait composition of the species assemblage clearly related to the environmental setting: mean specific leaf area and the proportion of annuals increased and the proportion of C-strategists decreased with increasing human-mediated impacts on the restoration sites. Conclusions Our results reveal clear trait differences between successful and failed target species in grassland restoration on urban wasteland sites, demonstrating that high competitive ability is crucial for success in target species. Grassland species that are successfully integrated into urban wasteland vegetation may thus fill well-defined vacant niches, while resembling the traits of the resident species in other ways. Our results may allow generalizations and transfer to similar urban settings, as the analysed trait states were assessed as relative values compared to resident species.

While these studies clearly support the role of biotic interactions in shaping species distributions, most examine only the influence of a single species and/or a single interaction, failing to account for species being subject to multiple concurrent interactions. By fitting species distribution models (SDMs), we examine the influence of multiple vertical (i.e., grazing, trampling, and manuring by mammalian herbivores) and horizontal (i.e., competition and facilitation; estimated from the cover of dominant plant species) interspecific interactions on the occurrence and cover of 41 alpine tundra plant species. Adding plant-plant interactions to baseline SDMs (using five field-quantified abiotic variables) significantly improved models' predictive power for independent data, while herbivore-related variables had only a weak influence. Overall, abiotic variables had the strongest individual contributions to the distribution of alpine tundra plants, with the importance of horizontal interaction variables exceeding that of vertical interaction variables. These results were consistent across three modeling techniques, for both species occurrence and cover, demonstrating the pattern to be robust. Thus, the explicit consideration of multiple biotic interactions reveals that plant-plant interactions exert control over the fine-scale distribution of vascular species that is comparable to abiotic drivers and considerably stronger than herbivores in this low-energy system.

AB Marine protected areas (MPA) are rapidly being established to minimize the impact of anthropogenic disturbances, yet, while climate change is acknowledged as a growing threat, very limited research exists about how to directly incorporate climate-related disturbances into MPA design. Using the conservation planning software Marxan and the Indo-west Pacific as a study region, an illustrative approach is developed here that incorporates climate change projections into the process of identifying priority areas for marine conservation. Conservation targets were set at 10% and 30% of areas that continually held sea-surface temperatures less than 1 degrees C above maximum non-extreme historic temperatures (derived from satellite imagery from 1984-2009). This approach allowed for continuity in conservation objectives across both space and time by identifying the geographic extent of thermal stress in the region and illustrating how conditions would change in future years. Achievement of targets was found to be flexible, but some areas were more important than others for achieving these targets. Interannual trend analyses were carried out for three climate models under two climate change scenarios to examine spatial and temporal patterns of thermal stress. Spatial patterns of thermal stress varied throughout the region. Results of the conservation approach were compared to the trend results to see whether the trends might be a simpler approach for accounting for climate change impacts in conservation planning (i.e., one feature could be used instead of more than 1000). The interannual analyses had a low overlap with the Marxan results, and hence are not a suitable substitute for the approach shown here. This study showed that inclusion of climate-related disturbances in marine conservation planning is feasible and should become common practice, together with targets for biodiversity.

AB The efficient use of water and nitrogen (N) to promote growth and increase yield of fruit trees and crops is well studied. However, little is known about their effects on woody plants growing in arid and semiarid areas with limited water and N availability. To examine the effects of water and N supply on early growth and water use efficiency (WUE) of trees on dry soils, one-year-old seedlings of Robinia pseudoacacia were exposed to three soil water contents (non-limiting, medium drought, and severe drought) as well as to low and high N levels, for four months. Photosynthetic parameters, leaf instantaneous WUE (WUEi) and whole tree WUE (WUEb) were determined. Results showed that, independent of N levels, increasing soil water content enhanced the tree transpiration rate (T-r), stomatal conductance (G(s)), intercellular CO2 concentration (C-i), maximum net assimilation rate (A(max)), apparent quantum yield (AQY), the range of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) due to both reduced light compensation point and enhanced light saturation point, and dark respiration rate (R-d), resulting in a higher net photosynthetic rate (P-n) and a significantly increased whole tree biomass. Consequently, WUEi and WUEb were reduced at low N, whereas WUEi was enhanced at high N levels. Irrespective of soil water availability, N supply enhanced P-n in association with an increase of G(s) and C-i and a decrease of the stomatal limitation value (L-s), while T-r remained unchanged. Biomass and WUEi increased under non-limiting water conditions and medium drought, as well as WUEb under all water conditions; but under severe drought, WUEi and biomass were not affected by N application. In conclusion, increasing soil water availability improves photosynthetic capacity and biomass accumulation under low and high N levels, but its effects on WUE vary with soil N levels. N supply increased P-n and WUEi but under severe drought, N supply did not enhance WUEi and biomass.

AB The ability of restoration approaches to provide valued ecosystem services needs to be assessed. The emerging carbon market provides an incentive to afforest agricultural landscapes and could potentially achieve multiple outcomes. However, planting monocultures for carbon sequestration may preclude effective delivery of other ecosystem services. Here, we describe the rationale behind the Ridgefield Multiple Ecosystem Services Experiment, a long-term investigation into trade-offs that might prevent the simultaneous provision of high levels of multiple services in the agricultural landscape of southwestern Australia. We compare a monoculture treatment of a fast growing native species (Eucalyptus loxophleba) with mixtures of 2,4 or 8 native plant species. We selected species based on different traits that we predict will relate to the provision of different levels of multiple ecosystem services. We ask: Can restoration of multiple ecosystem services be achieved along with carbon sequestration? Nested treatments of nitrogen deposition and weed removal test whether ecosystem service outcomes respond to environmental changes. We show that historical land-use at the site has the potential to affect service delivery via different soil characteristics and survival of planted species. Ridgefield tests the possibility of restoring and managing agricultural landscapes for multiple ecosystem services, providing a much needed experimental investigation of trade-offs among ecosystem functions.

AB Disturbance plays an important role in structuring marine ecosystems, and there is a need to understand how conservation practices, such as the designation of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), facilitate postdisturbance recovery. We evaluated the association of MPAs, herbivorous fish biomass, substrate type, postdisturbance coral cover, and change in macroalgal cover with coral recovery on the fringing reefs of the inner Seychelle islands, where coral mortality after a 1998 bleaching event was extensive. We visually estimated benthic cover and fish biomass at 9 sites in MPAs where fishing is banned and at 12 sites where fishing is permitted in 1994, 2005, 2008, and 2011. We used analysis of variance to examine spatial and temporal variations in coral cover and generalized additive models to identify relations between coral recovery and the aforementioned factors that may promote recovery. Coral recovery occurred on all substrate types, but it was highly variable among sites and times. Between 2005 and 2011 the increase in coral cover averaged 1%/year across 21 sites, and the maximum increase was 4%/year. However, mean coral cover across the study area (14%) remained at half of 1994 levels (28%). Sites within MPAs had faster rates of coral recovery than sites in fished areas only where cover of macroalgae was low and had not increased over time. In MPAs where macroalgae cover expanded since 1998 there was no recovery. Where coral was recovering on granite reefs there was a shift in relative prevalence of colony life-form from branching to encrusting species. This simplification of reef structure may affect associated reef fauna even if predisturbance levels of coral cover are attained.

AB Increasing empirical evidence indicates the number of released individuals (i.e. propagule pressure) and number of released species (i.e. colonization pressure) are key determinants of the number of species that successfully invade new habitats. In view of these relationships, and the possibility that ships transport whole communities of organisms, we collected 333 ballast water and sediment samples to investigate the relationship between propagule and colonization pressure for a variety of diverse taxonomic groups (diatoms, dinoflagellates and invertebrates). We also reviewed the scientific literature to compare the number of species transported by ships to those reported in nature. Here, we show that even though ships transport nearly entire local communities, a strong relationship between propagule and colonization pressure exists only for dinoflagellates. Our study provides evidence that colonization pressure of invertebrates and diatoms may fluctuate widely irrespective of propagule pressure. We suggest that the lack of correspondence is explained by reduced uptake of invertebrates into the transport vector and the sensitivity of invertebrates and diatoms to selective pressures during transportation. Selection during transportation is initially evident through decreases in propagule pressure, followed by decreased colonization pressure in the most sensitive taxa.

AB The aim of this article is to characterize at fine scale alpha and beta diversity patterns for Mexican amphibians and analyze how these patterns might change under a moderate climate-change scenario, highlighting the overall consequences for amphibian diversity at the country level. We used a geo-referenced database gathered from museums worldwide as a basis for climatic envelope models, based on the working assumptions that we can accurately model the ecological niche, niche conservatism, and that the future climate scenario is realistic. We generated six sets of models with different parameters (threshold of presence and dispersal capability) in the modelling processes. We simulated the base line (2000) and future scenarios for Mexican amphibian diversity (2020, 2050, 2080), using climate data layers constructed for Mexico. Using moving-window analyses of different sizes (9, 25, 100, 225 and 400 km(2)) we calculated beta diversity with R.H. Whittaker's formula beta = gamma/alpha(mean). We analyzed the changes of alpha- and beta-diversity spatial patterns during these periods, and performed an analysis of sensitivity for the beta-diversity patterns. We found that setting low dispersal capability generates high levels of species extinctions, but the overall geographic pattern of beta diversity remained stable. Zones of high beta diversity resulted that were associated with topographic formations, while the values of beta diversity initially increased, and then declined over time. Extinctions (complete loss of range within country boundaries) were particularly intense during the period 2020-2050. The results implied that heterogeneous zones associated with mountain ranges will remain particularly important for amphibian diversity and thus constitute areas for continued conservation prioritization in the face of climate change.

AB In recent years, new analytical tools have allowed researchers to extract historical information contained in molecular data, which has fundamentally transformed our understanding of processes ruling biological invasions. However, the use of these new analytical tools has been largely restricted to studies of terrestrial organisms despite the growing recognition that the sea contains ecosystems that are amongst the most heavily affected by biological invasions, and that marine invasion histories are often remarkably complex. Here, we studied the routes of invasion and colonisation histories of an invasive marine invertebrate Microcosmus squamiger (Ascidiacea) using microsatellite loci, mitochondrial DNA sequence data and 11 worldwide populations. Discriminant analysis of principal components, clustering methods and approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) methods showed that the most likely source of the introduced populations was a single admixture event that involved populations from two genetically differentiated ancestral regions - the western and eastern coasts of Australia. The ABC analyses revealed that colonisation of the introduced range of M. squamiger consisted of a series of non-independent introductions along the coastlines of Africa, North America and Europe. Furthermore, we inferred that the sequence of colonisation across continents was in line with historical taxonomic records - first the Mediterranean Sea and South Africa from an unsampled ancestral population, followed by sequential introductions in California and, more recently, the NE Atlantic Ocean. We revealed the most likely invasion history for world populations of M. squamiger, which is broadly characterized by the presence of multiple ancestral sources and non-independent introductions within the introduced range. The results presented here illustrate the complexity of marine invasion routes and identify a cause-effect relationship between human-mediated transport and the success of widespread marine non-indigenous species, which benefit from stepping-stone invasions and admixture processes involving different sources for the spread and expansion of their range.

AB Global warming will lead to earlier beginnings and prolongation of growing seasons in temperate regions and will have pronounced effects on phenology and life-history adaptation in many species. These changes were not easy to simulate for actual phenologies because of the rudimentary temporal (season) and spatial (regional) resolution of climate model projections. We investigate the effect of climate change on the regional incidence of a pest insect with nearly worldwide distribution and very high potential for adaptation to season length and temperature - the Codling Moth, Cydia pomonella. Seasonal and regional climate change signals were downscaled to the hourly temporal scale of a pest phenology model and the spatial scale of pest habitats using a stochastic weather generator operating at daily scale in combination with a re-sampling approach for simulation of hourly weather data. Under future conditions of increased temperatures (2045-2074), the present risk of below 20% for a pronounced second generation (peak larval emergence) in Switzerland will increase to 70-100%. The risk of an additional third generation will increase from presently 0-2% to 100%. We identified a significant two-week shift to earlier dates in phenological stages, such as overwintering adult flight. The relative extent (magnitude) of first generation pupae and all later stages will significantly increase. The presence of first generation pupae and later stages will be prolonged. A significant decrease in the length of overlap of first and second generation larval emergence was identified. Such shifts in phenology may induce changes in life-history traits regulating the life cycle. An accordingly life-history adaptation in photoperiodic diapause induction to shorter day-length is expected and would thereby even more increase the risk of an additional generation. With respect to Codling Moth management, the shifts in phenology and voltinism projected here will require adaptations of plant protection strategies to maintain their sustainability.

AB Inference concerning the impact of habitat fragmentation on dispersal and gene flow is a key theme in landscape genetics. Recently, the ability of established approaches to identify reliably the differential effects of landscape structure (e. g. land-cover composition, remnant vegetation configuration and extent) on the mobility of organisms has been questioned. More explicit methods of predicting and testing for such effects must move beyond post hoc explanations for single landscapes and species. Here, we document a process for making a priori predictions, using existing spatial and ecological data and expert opinion, of the effects of landscape structure on genetic structure of multiple species across replicated landscape blocks. We compare the results of two common methods for estimating the influence of landscape structure on effective distance: least-cost path analysis and isolation-by-resistance. We present a series of alternative models of genetic connectivity in the study area, represented by different landscape resistance surfaces for calculating effective distance, and identify appropriate null models. The process is applied to ten species of sympatric woodland-dependant birds. For each species, we rank a priori the expectation of fit of genetic response to the models according to the expected response of birds to loss of structural connectivity and landscape-scale tree-cover. These rankings (our hypotheses) are presented for testing with empirical genetic data in a subsequent contribution. We propose that this replicated landscape, multi-species approach offers a robust method for identifying the likely effects of landscape fragmentation on dispersal.

AB Despite ever-growing popularity of species distribution models (SDM), their performance under conditions of spatially biased data has rarely been studied in detail. Here we explore the effect of a known spatial bias on the predictive ability of Maxent models, using five species of the genus Asplenium with variable reproductive modes. The models were trained and tested on western and central European presence-only distributional data, first with random background and then with target-group background. Then we tested the models on an independent Ukrainian dataset of the same species, using the area under the curve (AUC) value as test statistic. We carried out a principal components analysis (PCA) on the collection localities of the individual species to explore the properties of their ecological niches. In all but one species, spatial bias in the distributional data resulted in poor performance of the Maxent models (trained on the European dataset and tested on the Ukrainian dataset). In all species correction for sampling bias resulted in significantly wider predicted climatic niches. Based on the results of the PCA, spatial bias resulted in environmental bias of variable degree. We argue that species reproductive biology should be taken into account when distributional data are analysed in terms of their suitability for species distribution modelling. The reported results will inform biodiversity conservation assessments, particularly those using data from natural history collections.

AB Terrestrial animals in subterranean habitats are often classified according to their degree of morphological or ecological specialization to the subterranean environment. The commonly held view is that, as distance into a cave increases, the frequency of morphologically specialized, i.e., troglomorphic, species or ecological specialization will increase. We tested this hypothesis for the fauna in 54 caves in Slovenia-the classical land for subterranean biology. We found that there exist two ecologically well separated terrestrial subsurface faunas: one shallow and one deep. 1) The shallow subterranean fauna, adapted to the terrestrial shallow subterranean habitats (SSHs) in the upper 10 m of subsurface strata, is most diverse. It consists of randomly distributed non-troglobionts and a major group of troglobionts adapted to the soil root zone. 2) The deep subterranean fauna is represented by a minor group of troglobionts, adapted to caves. Troglobionts are strictly divided between the two faunas. There is strong evidence that in karstic ecosystems with deep-rooted vegetation this might be a global pattern, or that in these locations only the shallow subterranean fauna exist.

AB Very few investigations have examined the direct impacts of vehicle exhausts on plants and attempted to separate out the key pollutants responsible for observed effects. This paper describes a multi-phase investigation into this topic, using 12 herbaceous species typical of urban areas and representing different functional groups. Fumigations were conducted in solardomes with diesel exhaust pollutants at concentrations designed to simulate those close to a major highway in inner London. A wide range of effects were detected, including growth stimulation and inhibition. changes in gas exchange and premature leaf senescence. This was complemented by controlled fumigations with NO. NO2 and their mixture, as well as a transect study away from a busy inner London road. All evidence suggested that NOx was the key phytotoxic component of exhaust emissions, and highlights the potential for detrimental effects of vehicle emissions on urban ecosystems.

TI Modelling species distributions with penalised logistic regressions: A
   comparison with maximum entropy models
SO ECOLOGICAL MODELLING
LA English
DT Article
DE Species distribution models; Regularisation; Generalised linear models;
   Calibration
ID PREDICTION; PERFORMANCE
AB An important aspect of species distribution modelling is the choice of the modelling method because a suboptimal method may have poor predictive performance. Previous comparisons have found that novel methods, such as Maxent models, outperform well-established modelling methods, such as the standard logistic regression. These comparisons used training samples with small numbers of occurrences per estimated model parameter, and this limited sample size may have caused poorer predictive performance due to overfitting. Our hypothesis is that Maxent models would outperform a standard logistic regression because Maxent models avoid overfitting by using regularisation techniques and a standard logistic regression does not. Regularisation can be applied to logistic regression models using penalised maximum likelihood estimation. This estimation procedure shrinks the regression coefficients towards zero, causing biased predictions if applied to the training sample but improving the accuracy of new predictions. We used Maxent and logistic regression (standard and penalised) to analyse presence/pseudo-absence data for 13 tree species and evaluated the predictive performance (discrimination) using presence-absence data. The penalised logistic regression outperformed standard logistic regression and equalled the performance of Maxent. The penalised logistic regression may be considered one of the best methods to develop species distribution models trained with presence/pseudo-absence data, as it is comparable to Maxent. Our results encourage further use of the penalised logistic regression for species distribution modelling, especially in those cases in which a complex model must be fitted to a sample with a limited size.

AB The introduction and spread of non-indigenous species (NIS) in marine ecosystems accelerated during the twentieth century owing to human activities, notably international shipping. Genetic analysis has proven useful in understanding the invasion history and dynamics of colonizing NIS and identifying their source population(s). Here we investigated sequence variation in the nuclear ribosomal Internal Transcribed Spacer region of the ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi, a species considered one of the most invasive globally. We surveyed four populations from the native distribution range along the Atlantic coasts of the United States and South America, as well as six populations in the introduced range from the Black, Azov, Caspian and Baltic seas. Allelic and nucleotide diversity of introduced populations were comparable to those of native populations from which they were likely drawn. Introduced populations typically exhibited lower genetic differentiation (F (ST) = -0.014-0.421) than native populations (F (ST) = 0.324-0.688). Population genetic analyses supported the invasion of Eurasia from at least two different pathways, the first from the Gulf of Mexico (e.g., Tampa Bay) to the Black Sea and thence to the Caspian Sea, the second from the northern part of the native distribution range (e.g., Narragansett Bay) to the Baltic Sea. The relatively high genetic diversity observed in introduced populations is consistent with large inocula and/or multiple invasions, both of which are possible given ballast water transport and the extensive native distribution of the ctenophore in the Atlantic Ocean.

AB Many arthropods engage in mutualisms in which they consume plant-based foods including nectar, extrafloral nectar, and honeydew. However, relatively little is known about the manner in which the specific macronutrients in these plant-based resources affect growth, especially for carnivorous arthropods. Using a combination of laboratory and field experiments, we tested (1) how plant-based foods, together with ad libitum insect prey, affect the growth of a carnivorous ant, Solenopsis invicta, and (2) which macronutrients in these resources (i.e., carbohydrates, amino acids, or both) contribute to higher colony growth. Access to honeydew increased the production of workers and brood in experimental colonies. This growth effect appeared to be due to carbohydrates alone as colonies provided with the carbohydrate component of artificial extrafloral nectar had greater worker and brood production compared to colonies deprived of carbohydrates. Surprisingly, amino acids only had a slight interactive effect on the proportion of a colony composed of brood and negatively affected worker survival. Diet choice in the laboratory and field matched performance in the laboratory with high recruitment to carbohydrate baits and only slight recruitment to amino acids. The strong, positive effects of carbohydrates on colony growth and the low cost of producing this macronutrient for plants and hemipterans may have aided the evolution of food-for-protection mutualisms and help explain why these interactions are so common in ants. In addition, greater access to plant-based resources in the introduced range of S. invicta may help to explain the high densities achieved by this species throughout the southeastern United States.

AB Developing policies to address lake eutrophication requires an understanding of the relative contribution of different nutrient sources and of how lake and catchment characteristics interact to mediate the source-receptor pathway. We analysed total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) data for 101 New Zealand lakes and related these to land use and edaphic sources of phosphorus (P). We then analysed a sub-sample of lakes in agricultural catchments to investigate how lake and catchment variables influence the relationship between land use and in-lake nutrients. Following correction for the effect of co-variation amongst predictor variables, high producing grassland (intensive pasture) was the best predictor of TN and TP, accounting for 38.6% and 41.0% of variation, respectively. Exotic forestry and urban area accounted for a further 18.8% and 3.6% of variation in TP and TN, respectively. Soil P (representing naturally-occurring edaphic P) was negatively correlated with TP, owing to the confounding effect of pastoral land use. Lake and catchment morphology (z(max) and lake : catchment area) and catchment connectivity (lake order) mediated the relationship between intensive pasture and in-lake nutrients. Mitigating eutrophication in New Zealand lakes requires action to reduce nutrient export from intensive pasture and quantifying P export from plantation forestry requires further consideration.

AB Salt marsh vegetation often occurs in zones along an elevational gradient. We present a detailed analysis of the distribution of species in a data set of 2,691 plots from salt marshes along the German North Sea coast. For each 1 m(2) plot, we estimated species' percent cover and calculated elevation in relation to mean high tide. For the 19 most frequent species, distribution and dominance pattern along the elevational gradient (correlated with moisture and salinity) were quantified and species' responses to this gradient analyzed by Huisman-Olff-Fresco (HOF) modelling. Elevational ranges, distribution pattern, and response curves varied widely among the species, with most species' niches positioned in the middle part of the gradient. Non-parametric multiple comparisons (in total 171) did not reveal significant differences in species' ranges for 40 species pairings. Most HOF models resulted in unimodal skewed response curves, with the probability of occurrence decreasing towards the lower and more extreme end of the gradient. We conclude that elevation largely explains species distribution within the studied salt marshes and that species ranges follow a continuum along the gradient. Our data provide a baseline for future studies of possible changes in distribution pattern caused by conservation management or sea level rise.

AB Increases in fertilizer inputs and livestock numbers affect plant species composition and richness; this in turn can affect the biodiversity of soil fauna and nutrient cycling in pastures. We selected two adjacent farmlets to study these effects. Since 1980, one farmlet (LF) had not received superphosphate fertilizer (SSP) and has a low stock density of sheep, and the other (HF) had received 37.5 g SSP m(-2) y(-1) and has a high stock density. In 2004, at both farmlets, we commenced treatments for 4 years, adding urea to raise N status, and non-residual selective herbicide to remove broadleaf species. Long-term SSP addition and increased sheep numbers, and added urea increased herbage production but reduced plant diversity. The effect of treatments on most of the soil biochemical and biological properties varied between years. This may have partly arisen from an infestation with Wiseana caterpillars in the first winter, causing resources to be low and total soil carbon (C) to be reduced by 4-8%; total C did, however, recover in later years. The urea and herbicide treatments caused greater changes above-ground than below-ground, but they did reduce soil microbial C and N and nematode diversity; urea at LF increased mineralizable N to the levels found at HF. On an area basis, HF generally had higher total C and N. earthworm and nematode numbers (including bacterial feeders, predators and omnivores), and nematode diversity, and greater values for the nematode channel ratio, than did LF. In contrast, the ratios of microbial C/total C and microbial N/total N, total mite numbers (including Oribatida, but not other mite groups), and fungal-feeding nematode numbers were higher at LF than at HF. Canonical correlation analysis suggested the plant and soil nematode communities responded in tandem and in predictable ways to the same environmental factors. Increased quantity and quality of inputs disadvantaged the fungal-based energy channel, with a measurable decline in the quantity of fungal phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs). While the quantity of bacterial PLFAs appeared to be unaffected by greater plant-derived inputs, the greater numbers of bacterial-feeding nematodes at the HF farmlet suggests the activity and flow of energy and nutrients through the bacterial community would be more important in the HF than the LF farmlet. Overall our results suggest the shift from fungal to bacterial pathways may lead to soil microbial/microfaunal interactions that retain less reactive N within soil biomass, with a consequent greater risk of N loss.

AB A ubiquitous problem for community-based regional environmental agencies is to set strategic management priorities among a myriad of issues and multiple stakeholder perspectives. Here, we quantify the strategic management priorities for natural capital and ecosystem services using multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) in a case study of the South Australian Murray-Darling Basin Natural Resources Management Board (the Board) region. A natural capital and ecosystem services framework was tailored to present decision-makers with a range of potential issues for strategic consideration as goal hierarchies in MCDA. Priorities were elicited from the Board and its four regionally based consultative groups using the Analytical Hierarchy Process and swing weights. Centered log ratio transformed weights were analyzed using multiple pairwise ANOVA comparisons (Dunnett's T3) and hierarchical cluster analysis. Substantial variation in priorities occurred between decision-makers. Nonetheless, analysis of priorities for assets and services robustly demonstrated that water was the highest priority, followed by land, then biota, with atmosphere the lowest priority. Decision-makers also considered that environmental management should not impact negatively on built or social capital. Few significant differences in priorities were found between decision-maker groups. However, clusters of manager types were found which represent distinct alternative management strategies, notably the prioritization of either intermediate or final ecosystem services. The results have implications for regional environmental decision-making and suggest that embracing variation in perspectives may be a better way forward for multistakeholder MCDA. The study operationalizes natural capital and ecosystem services by providing strategic priorities for targeting management and policy within the context of community-based, regional environmental management.

AB P>1. Eutrophication has a profound effect on the biological structure and function of shallow lakes, altering the composition and abundance of submerged macrophyte and fish assemblages. Relatively little is known, however, about decadal to centennial-scale change in these important aspects of shallow lake ecology.
   2. Established palaeolimnological inference models are limited to reconstructing a single variable. As macrophyte and zooplanktivorous fish abundance exert dual and interacting controls on cladoceran assemblages a single variable inference model may contain significant error. To obviate this problem, we applied a new cladoceran-based multivariate regression tree (MRT) model to cladoceran subfossil assemblages from dated cores from a small shallow lake (Felbrigg Lake, U.K.) to assess long-term change in fish and submerged macrophyte abundance. Plant macrofossil, chironomid and mollusc subfossil assemblages were also analysed to track changes in biological structure and function and to evaluate the inferences of the MRT model.
   3. Over the 200+ year period covered by the sediment cores, there was good agreement in the timing and nature of ecological change reflected by the plant macrofossil, mollusc, chironomid and cladoceran data. The sediment sequence was divided into three dated zones: c. 1797-1890, c. 1890-1954 and c. 1954-present. Prior to 1890 plant-associated mollusc, cladoceran and chironomid assemblages indicated a species-rich macrophyte community; a scenario confirmed by the plant macrofossil data. From c. 1890 to 1954 macrophyte-associated species of all three invertebrate groups remained abundant but the proportion of pelagic cladocerans rose. Post-1954 mollusc and chironomid assemblages changed to sediment associated detrital feeders and the proportion of pelagic cladoceran taxa increased further.
   4. The cladoceran-based MRT model indicated a long period of stability, c. 1790-1927, characterised by abundant submerged macrophytes and zooplanktivorous fish. From c. 1927 to 1980, the MRT model inferred a decline in zooplanktivorous fish density (ZF) but relative stability in August macrophyte abundance. From 1980 to 2000, an increase in zooplanktivorous fish was inferred tallying well with available data on the fish population (since the 1970s), which indicated extirpation of perch in the 1970s and a subsequent increase in the rudd population. The model inferred little change in August macrophyte abundance until post-c. 1980 at which point it indicated a decline. The surface sediment assemblage was placed in MRT group A, where submerged plants are absent or very rare in late summer in good agreement with current conditions at the site.
   5. The MRT model, applied here for the first time, appears to have successfully tracked changes in macrophyte abundance and ZF over the last 200 years at Felbrigg Lake. The inferences agreed with historical observations on the fish community and the supporting palaeolimnological data. Given that multiple structuring forces shape most biological communities, the application of a model capable of allowing for this represents a significant advance in palaeolimnology.

AB Disjunct species distributions may result from a combination of geologic events and long-distance dispersal. The foliose lichen species complex Leptogium furfuraceum-L. pseudofurfuraceum has an intercontinental disjunction pattern. Populations of this species complex are found in western North America, southern South America, Africa, and southern Europe. We conducted a phylogenetic study to reconstruct the biogeographic history of this species complex using two ribosomal genes (ITS and LSU) and a protein-coding gene (partial RPB2). Results indicated that the complex comprises four geographically restricted genetic lineages. A sister relationship was found between populations from the same hemispheres, incongruent with previous data derived from morphological characteristics and geographical classification schemes. Incorporating Bayesian ancestral area reconstruction and Bayesian divergence time estimation, we proposed an evolutionary hypothesis for the species complex. The results suggested that processes of biotic expansion via transoceanic dispersal were responsible for the species divergence and distribution patterns observed today. This study also expands the view that cryptic speciation is not a rare phenomenon among fungi and lichens.

AB Recent climate change has caused diverse ecological responses in plants and animals. However, relatively little is known about homeothermic animals' ability to adapt to changing temperature regimes through changes in body size, in accordance with Bergmann's rule. We used fluctuations in mean annual temperatures in south-west Germany since 1972 in order to look for direct links between temperature and two aspects of body size: body mass and flight feather length. Data from regionally born juveniles of 12 passerine bird species were analysed. Body mass and feather length varied significantly among years in eight and nine species, respectively. Typically the inter-annual changes in morphology were complexly non-linear, as was inter-annual variation in temperature. For six (body mass) and seven species (feather length), these inter-annual fluctuations were significantly correlated with temperature fluctuations. However, negative correlations consistent with Bergmann's rule were only found for five species, either for body mass or feather length. In several of the species for which body mass and feather length was significantly associated with temperature, morphological responses were better predicted by temperature data that were smoothed across multiple years than by the actual mean breeding season temperatures of the year of birth. This was found in five species for body mass and three species for feather length. These results suggest that changes in body size may not merely be the result of phenotypic plasticity but may hint at genetically based microevolutionary adaptations.

AB Background: Tunicates represent a key metazoan group as the sister-group of vertebrates within chordates. The six complete mitochondrial genomes available so far for tunicates have revealed distinctive features. Extensive gene rearrangements and particularly high evolutionary rates have been evidenced with regard to other chordates. This peculiar evolutionary dynamics has hampered the reconstruction of tunicate phylogenetic relationships within chordates based on mitogenomic data.
   Results: In order to further understand the atypical evolutionary dynamics of the mitochondrial genome of tunicates, we determined the complete sequence of the solitary ascidian Herdmania momus. This genome from a stolidobranch ascidian presents the typical tunicate gene content with 13 protein-coding genes, 2 rRNAs and 24 tRNAs which are all encoded on the same strand. However, it also presents a novel gene arrangement, highlighting the extreme plasticity of gene order observed in tunicate mitochondrial genomes. Probabilistic phylogenetic inferences were conducted on the concatenation of the 13 mitochondrial protein-coding genes from representatives of major metazoan phyla. We show that whereas standard homogeneous amino acid models support an artefactual sister position of tunicates relative to all other bilaterians, the CAT and CAT+BP site- and time-heterogeneous mixture models place tunicates as the sister-group of vertebrates within monophyletic chordates. Moreover, the reference phylogeny indicates that tunicate mitochondrial genomes have experienced a drastic acceleration in their evolutionary rate that equally affects protein-coding and ribosomal-RNA genes.
   Conclusion: This is the first mitogenomic study supporting the new chordate phylogeny revealed by recent phylogenomic analyses. It illustrates the beneficial effects of an increased taxon sampling coupled with the use of more realistic amino acid substitution models for the reconstruction of animal phylogeny.

We explored three biogeographic hypotheses: that sea level changes have resulted in the isolation of populations by drainages; that glaciation has impacted genetic diversity; and that ichthyological subprovince boundaries correspond to phylogeographic breaks in our focal species. We found seven well-supported clades within T. areolatus with high levels of genetic divergence. The strongest signal in our data was for an important role of sea level changes structuring populations. Five of the seven clades mapped cleanly to the geographic landscape and breaks corresponded closely to areas of narrowest continental shelf. In addition, few haplotypes were shared between rivers within clades, suggesting that only limited local movement of individuals has occurred. There was no relationship between the levels of genetic diversity and the proportion of individual drainages covered by glaciers during the last glacial maximum. Two phylogeographic breaks within T. areolatus did match the two previously identified faunal boundaries, but we found three additional breaks, which suggests that faunal breaks have only limited utility in explaining phylogeographic patterns. These results imply that the narrow continental shelf coupled with sea level changes had a strong influence on the obligate freshwater fishes in Chile.

AB We examined the spatial and temporal variation of species diversity and genetic diversity in a metacommunity comprising 16 species of freshwater gastropods. We monitored species abundance at five localities of the Ain river floodplain in southeastern France, over a period of four years. Using 190 AFLP loci, we monitored the genetic diversity of Radix balthica, one of the most abundant gastropod species of the metacommunity, twice during that period. An exceptionally intense drought occurred during the last two years and differentially affected the study sites. This allowed us to test the effect of natural disturbances on changes in both genetic and species diversity. Overall, local (alpha) diversity declined as reflected by lower values of gene diversity H-S and evenness. In parallel, the among-sites (beta) diversity increased at both the genetic (F-ST) and species (F-STC) levels. These results suggest that disturbances can lead to similar changes in genetic and community structure through the combined effects of selective and neutral processes.

AB Interactions between short-beaked common dolphins Delphinus delphis and the fishing industry of South Australia (SA) have lead to serious concerns over the long-term viability of the local dolphin population. Common dolphins are gregarious animals with high vagility and are expected to display limited genetic differentiation over large spatial scales. Here, we investigate population genetic structure of southern Australian common dolphins using mitochondrial DNA control region sequences and seven microsatellite markers. We found unexpected levels of genetic differentiation for short-beaked common dolphins over a distance of similar to 1500 km. Although no genetic structure was observed in common dolphins along the coast of SA, we detected marked differentiation between dolphins from SA and south-eastern Tasmania, suggesting a minimum of two genetic populations in southern Australia. We hypothesize that the ephemeral distribution of small pelagic fish enhances movement and dispersal between dolphin groups at a local level. However, clear differences in water temperature, habitat features and fish abundance between SA and Tasmania may contribute to the contemporary isolation observed between dolphin populations. Our findings have important consequences for developing conservation management strategies, because SA has the largest purse-seine fishery by weight in Australia, and substantial numbers of fatal common dolphin interactions have occurred. In 2004/2005 alone, an estimated 1728 common dolphins were encircled and 377 died over a 7-month period. If these impacts lead to a reduction in population size, it is unlikely that dolphins from the adjacent south-eastern Tasmanian population will replace the lost individuals. Recommendations for assessing the impacts of the fishery are presented. The information herein may also have implications for fisheries-marine mammal interactions in coastal and neritic habitats in other areas of the world. Moreover, we demonstrate that a species commonly thought to be wide ranging can show an unexpected degree of genetic differentiation.

AB 1. There is growing evidence that ongoing climate change affects populations and species. Physiological limitation and phenotypic plasticity suggest nonlinear response of vital rates to climatic parameters, the intensity of environmental impact might be more pronounced while the frequency of extreme events increases. However, a poor understanding of these patterns presently hampers our predictive capabilities.
   2. A recent climatic shift in the Sahel, from droughty to less severe condition, offers a good opportunity to test for an influence of the climatic regime on the response of organisms to their environment. Using a long-term capture-mark-recapture data set on a white stork (Ciconia ciconia) population wintering in Sahel, we investigated potential change in the impact of environmental conditions on survival and recruitment probabilities between 1981 and 2003.
   3. We observed a decrease in the strength of the link between survival and Sahel rainfall during the last decade, down to a nondetectable level. Whether Sahel climate was found to affect the survival of storks under droughty conditions, individuals did not seem to respond to climatic variation when precipitation was more abundant.
   4. This result gives evidence to a nonlinear response of a migrant bird to wintering environment. Present climate seems to fluctuate within a range of condition providing enough resources to maximize stork's survival. It suggests that whereas inter-annual variability impacted individuals, pluri-annual average condition affected the intensity of this impact. Such pattern may be more widespread than thought, and its modelling will be crucial to predict the impact of future climate change on population dynamics.

AB This study examined within-reef distributions for 19 species of butterflyfishes (Chaetodontidae) at Lizard Island, northern Great Barrier Reef, Australia, and compared spatial patterns of abundance among species with contrasting diets. Spatial variation in abundance of butterflyfishes was most prominent among physiognomic reef zones mainly due to significant zonation of eight species, including four obligate hard-coral feeders (Chaetodon trifascialis, Chaetodon baronessa, Chaetodon plebeius and Chaetodon lunulatus) and four generalist species (Chaetodon auriga, Chaetodon citrinellus, Chaetodon kleinii and Chaetodon rafflesi). Distributions of obligate hard-coral feeders were closely associated with spatial variation in percentage cover of scleractinian corals, but no more restricted compared with facultative hard-coral feeders or non-coral feeders. Species with highest dietary specialization (C. trifascialis and C. baronessa), however, exhibited the most pronounced zonation patterns and were restricted to habitats with greatest abundance of their preferred prey. While there are conspicuous links between dietary specialization v. spatial patterns in abundance of butterflyfishes, it remains unclear whether dietary specialization is the cause or consequence of more restricted distributions.

AB To aid in future efforts to accurately reconstruct the vertebrate tree, a quantitative measure of phylogenetic informativeness was applied to nucleotide and amino acid sequences for a set of 11 genes. We identified orthologues and assembled published fossil-calibrated divergence times between taxa that had been sequenced for each gene. Rates of molecular evolution for each site were estimated to characterize the molecular evolutionary pattern of genes and to calculate the phylogenetic informativeness. The fast-evolving gene albumin yielded the highest informativeness over the period from 60 million years ago to 500 million years ago. In contrast, calmodulin yielded the lowest informativeness, presumably because functional constraint minimized substitutions in the amino acid sequence. The gene c-myc showed an intermediate level of informativeness. The nucleotide sequence of cytochrome b showed extremely high utility for recent epochs, but low utility for times before 100 million years ago. We ranked nine other genes for their utility during the epochs of the divergence of the muroid rodents, early placental mammals, early vertebrates, and early metazoa, yielding results consistent with, but more precise than, previous studies. Interestingly, DNA sequence always exceeded amino acid sequence in informativeness over all time scales, yet support values were at best moderately higher. For epochs not subject to strong phylogenetic conflict due to convergence, we advocate gleaning the additional power of the threefold increase in number of characters that is present for DNA sequences over resorting to the less noisy but less informative amino acid sequences.

AB The Eastern Arc Mountains (EAMs) of Tanzania and Kenya support some of the most ancient tropical rainforest on Earth. The forests are a global priority for biodiversity conservation and provide vital resources to the Tanzanian population. Here, we make a first attempt to predict the spatial distribution of 40 EAM tree species, using generalised additive models, plot data and environmental predictor maps at sub 1 km resolution. The results of three modelling experiments are presented, investigating predictions obtained by (1) two different procedures for the stepwise selection of predictors, (2) down-weighting absence data, and (3) incorporating an autocovariate term to describe fine-scale spatial aggregation. In response to recent concerns regarding the extrapolation of model predictions beyond the restricted environmental range of training data, we also demonstrate a novel graphical tool for quantifying envelope uncertainty in restricted range niche-based models (envelope uncertainty maps). We find that even for species with very few documented occurrences useful estimates of distribution can be achieved. Initiating selection with a null model is found to be useful for explanatory purposes, while beginning with a full predictor set can over-fit the data. We show that a simple multimodel average of these two best-model predictions yields a superior compromise between generality and precision (parsimony). Down-weighting absences shifts the balance of errors in favour of higher sensitivity, reducing the number of serious mistakes (i.e., falsely predicted absences); however, response functions are more complex, exacerbating uncertainty in larger models. Spatial autocovariates help describe fine-scale patterns of occurrence and significantly improve explained deviance, though if important environmental constraints are omitted then model stability and explanatory power can be compromised. We conclude that the best modelling practice is contingent both on the intentions of the analyst (explanation or prediction) and on the quality of distribution data; generalised additive models have potential to provide valuable information for conservation in the EAMs, but methods must be carefully considered, particularly if occurrence data are scarce. Full results and details of all species models are supplied in an online Appendix. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Questions: 1. How many traits associated with persistence and regeneration are necessary to predict the response of plants to soil fertility and disturbance? 2. Are correlated changes in trait expressions linked to the response of functional groups to fertility and disturbance?
   Location: Lower Frankonia, Germany.
   Methods: On 120 plots located in managed and abandoned grasslands, fields, and vineyards, we recorded species composition, disturbance intensity, soil water and nutrients, and ten candidate traits for 75 species. We used a novel method which is based on three steps: (1) logistic regression to separate responsive from non-responsive species; (2) iterative clustering of all possible combinations of the candidate traits including regression of each cluster in response to the environmental variables; ( 3) selection of the trait combination that performed best with respect to goodness of fit of all clusters from this combination. Bivariate trait relationships across functional groups were analysed with reduced major axis regression (RMA).
   Results: The parsimonious trait combination consisted of life span, specific leaf area (SLA), canopy height, and seed number. The 'acquisitive' functional groups in terms of SLA and height were linked to higher fertility and earlier disturbance, while the 'retentive' groups related to lower fertility and later disturbance. Investment in reproduction, however, displayed a reverse relation. SLA and canopy height showed correlated shifts in two pairs of co-occurring functional groups.
   Conclusions: A small number of traits is sufficient to predict the response of species. Plants need a higher increment in SLA to reach the same height, if start of disturbance is earlier. Linkages between traits shift from generative to vegetative with increasing fertility and earlier start of disturbance. Functional groups enable shifts in scaling relationships between traits to be analysed, in contrast to the analysis of single traits.

AB The mitochondrial 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequences from 93 cyprinid fishes were examined to reconstruct the phylogenetic relationships within the diverse and economically important subfamily Cyprininae. Within the subfamily a biased nucleotide composition (A > T, C > G) was observed in the loop regions of the gene, and in stem regions apparent selective pressures of base pairing showed a bias in favor of G over C and T over A. The bias may be associated with transition-transversion bias. Rates of nucleotide substitution were lower in stems than in loops. Analysis of compensatory substitutions across these taxa demonstrates 68% covariation in the gene and a logical weighting factor to account for dependence in mutations for phylogenetic inference should be 0.66. Comparisons of varied stem-loop weighting schemes indicate that the down-weightings for stem regions could improve the phylogenetic analysis and the degree of non-independence of stem substitutions was not as important as expected. Bayesian inference under four models of nucleotide substitution indicated that likelihood-based phylogenetic analyses were more effective in improving the phylogenetic performance than was weighted parsimony analysis. In Bayesian analyses, the resolution of phylogenies under the 16-state models for paired regions, incorporating GTR + G + I models for unpaired regions was better than those under other models. The subfamily Cyprininae was resolved as a monophyletic group, as well as tribe Labein and several genera. However, the monophyly of the currently recognized tribes, such as Schizothoracin, Barbin, Cyprinion + Onychostoma lineages, and some genera was rejected. Furthermore, comparisons of the parsimony and Bayesian analyses and results of variable length bootstrap analysis indicates that the mitochondrial 16S rRNA gene should contain important character variation to recover well-supported phylogeny of cyprinid taxa whose divergences occurred within the recent 8 MY, but could not provide resolution power for deep phylogenies spanning 10-19 MYA.

AB 1. This study aimed to link basic ethnobiological research on local ecological knowledge (LEK) to the conservation of Brazilian streams, based on two case studies: original data on LEK of fishermen about freshwater fish in the Negro River, Amazon, and previously published data about LEK of farmers on the ecological relationship between forest and streams in the Macabuzinho catchment, Atlantic Forest.
   2. Information was obtained from fishermen through interviews using standard questionnaires containing open-ended questions. Informants for interview were selected either following some defined criteria or applying the 'snowball' method.
   3. Fishermen's LEK about the diets and habitats of 14 fish species in the Negro River provided new biological information on plant species that are eaten by fish, in addition to confirming some ecological patterns from the biological literature, such as dependence of fish on forests as food sources.
   4. In the Atlantic Forest, a comparison between farmers' LEK and a rapid stream assessment in the farmers' properties indicated that farmers tended to overestimate the ecological integrity of their streams. Farmers recognized at least 11 forest attributes that correspond to the scientific concept of ecosystem services. Such information may be useful to promote or enhance dialogue among farmers, scientists and managers.
   5. These results may contribute to the devising of ecosystem management measures in the Negro River, aimed to conserve both rivers and their associated floodplain forests, involving local fishermen. In the Atlantic Forest, we proposed some initiatives, such as to allow direct economic use of their forests to conciliate conflicting perceptions of farmers about ecological benefits versus economic losses from reforestation. Despite their cultural, environmental and geographical differences, the two study cases are complementary and cost-effective and promising approaches to including LEK in the design of ecological research.

AB In the temperate zone of Japan, Pinus dens flora Sieb. et Zucc. bears needles of up to three age classes in the upper crown and up to five age classes in the lower crown. To elucidate the effects of leaf age on photosynthetic parameters and its relationships with leaf mass per unit area (LMA) and leaf nitrogen (N-1) concentration on an area (N-a) and mass (N-m) basis, we measured seasonal variations in LMA, N-1, light-saturated photosynthetic rate (A(max)), stomata conductance (g(s)), maximum rate of carboxylation (V-cmax) and maximum rate of electron transport (J(max)) in leaves of all age classes in the upper and lower crown. Leaf mass per unit area increased by 27% with increasing leaf age in the lower crown, but LMA did not depend on age in the upper crown. Leaf age had a significant effect on N-m but not on Na in both crown positions, indicating that decreases in N-m resulted from dilution. Photosynthetic parameters decreased significantly with leaf age in the lower crown (39% for A(max) and 43% for V-cmax), but the effect of leaf age was not as great in the upper crown, although these parameters exhibited seasonal variation in both crown positions. Regression analysis indicated a close relationship between LMA and Na, 2 regardless of age class or when each age class was pooled (r(2) = 0.57-0.86). Relationships between LMA and N-a and among A(max), V-cmax and J(max) were weak or not significant when all age classes were examined by regression analysis. However, compared with older leaves, relationships among LMA, N-a and A(max) were stronger in younger leaves. These results indicate that changes in LMA and N-1 mainly reflect light acclimation during leaf development, but they are only slightly affected by irradiance in mature leaves. In conclusion, LMA and N-1 are useful parameters for estimating photosynthetic capacity, but age-related effects need to be taken into account, especially in evergreen conifers.

AB 1. A 7-year study was conducted in three hydrologically distinct sections within the highly regulated, lowland Campaspe River to investigate the influence of hydrology on temporal and spatial patterns in fish composition, abundance and recruitment. One section had 6 months, one section 2 months and one section no months of increased flow due to storage releases. The fish fauna of the less regulated, nearby Broken River served as a reference to which that of the Campaspe River was compared for the last 3 years of the study to allow insight into the relative effects of hydrology, barriers to movement and other environmental characteristics. The study included one high-flow year, a moderate-flow year and five low-flow years.
   2. A total of 16 fish species - 10 native and six alien - were caught in the Campaspe River, although of the native species, only three are considered to have self-sustaining populations. The remaining species are either itinerants or a result of stocking. Alien species comprised approximately 64% of the total biomass of all fish caught.
   3. Overall composition of the fish fauna did not differ significantly by year, but did by section of river. Species richness and the abundance of most of the dominant species also differed significantly by river section, but there was little inter-annual variation in the abundance of any species, except for European perch and for common carp; the latter showing an increase in abundance following a high-flow event during the spring of 2000 as a result of recruitment.
   4. Overall faunal composition was not influenced by hydrology. However, multiple regression indicated that species richness, abundance of the dominant species and abundance of young-of-year (YOY) of golden perch, European perch and common carp all were influenced significantly by hydrological variables. The nature of the relationships was dependent on river section and hydrological season ('winter' or 'spring/summer'). Of note was the result that the total abundance of fish and that of YOY common carp were significantly positively related to the number of spells above the threshold for movement upstream through the lower two weirs in the Campaspe River. Only one significant relationship between hydrological and fish-related variables was found for the upper river section, whereas seven and five were found for the lower and middle sections respectively.
   5. Comparisons with fish collected in the Broken River over 3 years suggest that the fauna of the Broken River is in a more natural state than that of the Campaspe River. Since the two rivers do not differ substantially in water quality, and since both contain significant weirs, which act as barriers to movement of fish, flow regulation is most likely to be the major reason for the poor state of the fauna in the Campaspe River.

AB Dusky grouper (garoupa, Epinephelus marginatus) is an important catch for several artisanal small-scale fisheries along the Brazilian coast. It is a sedentary, monandric, and late maturing protogynous species, which makes it vulnerable to overharvesting even though it is mainly caught through hook and line or spear fishing through free diving. Lack of information on the ecology and biology of this species in Brazil is astonishing. Much of the information found in the literature concerns Mediterranean dusky groupers. Studies compiling local knowledge (ethnoecology) about fish species complement biological data, and have been fundamental for effective fisheries management. In this study, our objectives are to obtain data about dusky grouper through fish catches and analysis of stomach contents and gonad maturation (macroscopic analyses), along with interviews from fishermen from six small-scales communities from the southern (Pantano do Sul, Florianopolis, Santa Catarina State) to the northern Brazilian coast (Porto Sauipe, Bahia State). We conclude that precautionary approaches and 'data-less' management approaches are needed in the coast of Brazil. Research on this species and on the potential of aquaculture for its cultivation, are urgent, due to the apparent vulnerability and decrease of dusky grouper along the coast of Brazil.

AB Coral reefs are being degraded worldwide by perturbations that range from local disturbances to large-scale climate forcing. To gain insight into possible responses of the fish community to losses of live coral, we surveyed large plots that represented the range in cover of live coral in lagoons of Moorea, French Polynesia, to explore relationships between cover of live coral and 3 attributes of the associated fish community: species richness, total abundance, and species composition, All measured attributes of the fish community were insensitive to changes in live coral cover over a wide range before falling sharply as live coral cover approached zero. A field experiment in which the percentage of living tissue of branching coral was varied while total coral volume and structural complexity were kept constant revealed a rapidly asymptotic relationship of fish richness with increases in cover of live coral that was qualitatively identical to the pattern documented in our surveys. There was qualitative agreement in the pattern of abundance response of fish with variation in cover of live coral between the experiment and field surveys. While the structural heterogeneity provided by coral skeletons can influence the local fish assemblage, the experiment reported here demonstrates that the amount of living coral tissue alone can have a substantial effect on the structure of the fish assemblage. Taken together, the results suggest that local fish assemblages could be resistant to variation in abundance of live coral, changing significantly only as coral becomes rare, while recovery may occur with only modest increases in live coral.

AB Calcrete aquifers of the Yilgarn area of Western Australia and the Ngalia Basin, Northern Territory, Australia are known to contain a rich invertebrate stygofauna, including the world's most diverse assemblage of subterranean diving beetles. Here we determine the generic relationships of these subterranean diving beetle species in the tribe Hydroporini and assess their evolutionary origins. Phylogenetic analyses of 1642 base pairs of mitochondrial DNA ( mtDNA), comprising segments of CO1, 16S rRNA, tRNA(leu) and ND1 genes, revealed that the subterranean species from the arid zone, previously classified under the genus Nirripirti Watts & Humphreys ( Hydroporini), are all closely related to the genus Paroster Sharp. We synonymise the stygobitic genus Nirripirti with the genus Paroster. Factors that may have been important for the transitions to stygobitic life such as historical and contemporary species distributions, reproductive ecology and body size are discussed. We show that pre-adaptations such as preference for temporary, but seasonally reliable, water and preference to live among gravel and sand along running water would have favoured transitions from surface to stygobitic life, but that large body size may have restricted the likelihood of successful transitions.

AB Increasingly, local ecological knowledge (LEK) held by groups of people engaging directly with their ecosystems for food production is recognized as a valuable tool for understanding environmental change, as well as for ecosystem management and conservation. However, the acceptance of LEK for resource management has been partly hindered by difficulties in translating local knowledge into a form that can be applied directly to Western scientific endeavors. Anthropology's focus on cultural meaning makes its practitioners uniquely qualified to find common ground between different systems of knowledge. Here, I report the use of ethnographic methods to represent Puerto Rican small-scale fishers' knowledge about tropical coastal habitat connectivity and the composition of species assemblages by underwater habitats. These two topics are of current interest for tropical fishery science and their study can benefit from fishers' extensive experience with the coastal environments on which they depend.

AB The role of land cover change as a significant component of global change has become increasingly recognized in recent decades. Large databases measuring land cover change, and the data which can potentially be used to explain the observed changes, are also becoming more commonly available. When developing statistical models to investigate observed changes, it is important to be aware that the chosen sampling strategy and modelling techniques can influence results.
   We present a comparison of three sampling strategies and two forms of grouped logistic regression models (multinomial and ordinal) in the investigation of patterns of successional change after agricultural land abandonment in Switzerland.
   Results indicated that both ordinal and nominal transitional change occurs in the landscape and that the use of different sampling regimes and modelling techniques as investigative tools yield different results.
   Synthesis and applications. Our multimodel inference identified successfully a set of consistently selected indicators of land cover change, which can be used to predict further change, including annual average temperature, the number of already overgrown neighbouring areas of land and distance to historically destructive avalanche sites. This allows for more reliable decision making and planning with respect to landscape management. Although both model approaches gave similar results, ordinal regression yielded more parsimonious models that identified the important predictors of land cover change more efficiently. Thus, this approach is favourable where land cover change pattern can be interpreted as an ordinal process. Otherwise, multinomial logistic regression is a viable alternative.

AB Studies on soil strength and rooting characteristics of crops are important for water and nutrient budgeting and also for deciding the adoption of suitable soil management practice for sustainable crop production. In the present field trial, the variation of soil penetration resistance (PR) with soil water content (SWC (w/w)) and bulk density (BD) changes under bed and conventionally planted wheat was studied on a sandy loam soil of research farm of Indian Agricultural Research Institute, New Delhi. The differences in root characteristics of both systems were also compared. The results showed that, in general for all SWC, with increase in BD from 1.2 to 1.6 Mg m(-3), PR increased but the increase was more sharp in conventional than in bed planting system. It was further seen that, at all BDs, the critical soil strength of 2 MPa arrived at higher SWC in conventional as compared to bed planting. It thus indicated that root growth continued normally at relative lower SWC in bed planting as compared to conventional planting.
   Multiple regression analysis of soil penetration resistance as a function of BD, SWC and soil depth showed that SWC alone accounted for 59% variation and along with BD accounted for 93-96% variation in PR. Addition of depth did not improve the correlation.
   Sensitivity analysis of multiple regression equation predicting penetration as a function of SWC and BD indicated that PR was more sensitive to SWC changes than BD changes. Lower sensitivity indices for both SWC and BD in bed planting than in conventional planting indicated relatively lesser change in PR per unit change in SWC or BD in bed system.
   Computer aided root length scanning system 'RHIZO' was used to study rooting characteristics. Analysis showed that root characteristics including root length density, average root diameter, surface area density and volume density of roots of wheat up to 30 cm were significantly higher in bed over conventional system. In both systems, nearly 70% of root length density and 76-82% of root surface area was confined in upper 30 cm. It was further seen that more than 70% of total root length was in root diameter range below 0.3 mm.
   Hence, it was concluded that sowing of wheat on beds reduced mechanical impedance and increased root growth in upper 30 cm of soil, which ultimately resulted in higher crop yield. (c) 2006 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Recent research has suggested that the Barmah-Millewa forest (BMF) floodplain provides a particularly important spawning ground for carp in the Murray River and that there is a large export of juvenile carp from the BMF into other parts of the Murray River system. This study examined whether chemical analysis of otoliths (fish ear stones) represents a feasible technique for estimating the relative importance of particular sources of carp recruitment in the Murray River. Otolith chemical signatures were analysed for fish collected from three lakes on the BMF floodplain and from three major tributaries of the mid-Murray River. A single site downstream of these potential sources of carp recruitment (Torrumbarry Weir) was then examined to estimate the relative contribution of the BMF and the tributaries to carp recruitment at this site. The results of the study suggest that at least some of the lakes on the BMF floodplain are important sources of carp in the mid-Muffay River. Using a maximum likelihood analysis of otolith chemical signatures, it was estimated that Barmah Lake and Moira Lake were the most likely recruitment sources for 98% of the fish collected from Torrumbarry Weir. The study demonstrates the potential application of otolith chemical analyses for determining the relative importance of potential recruitment sources of fish in rivers.

AB Matsutake (Tricholoma spp.) are a group of commercially important mushrooms that are increasingly threatened by over-collection. Ecologically sustainable management of matsutake has been hindered by the lack of essential information such as reliable distribution maps. Although a variety of spatial distribution models have been applied to map many different plants, this has rarely been attempted for mushrooms. In this study, we employed a logistic regression and a GIS expert system to model the fine-scale spatial distribution of matsutake in Yunnan southwest China Both models predicted mushroom habitat to an accuracy acceptable for resource management. The overall mapping accuracy of the GIS expert system was slightly better than the logistic regression model (70.37% versus 65.43%). Furthermore, unlike the logistic regression model, developing the GIS expert system required no field-based samples. This has important practical implications because it is very difficult to survey and sample mushrooms and other non-wood forest products (NWFP), which are usually inconspicuous species and/or lower plants. Therefore, when adequate samples are not available, incorporating local expert knowledge can help make better-informed management decisions and provide an affordable habitat identification tool.

AB Many field experiments have tested for effects of competition in nature, but relatively few have used designs allowing simultaneous assessment of the influence of intra- and interspecific competition. Using a response surface design and a press manipulation of densities, we tested effects of competition within and between two species of coral reef fishes (Coryphopterus glaucofraneum and Gnatholepis thompsoni). By tracking individually tagged fishes, we showed that the per-capita effect of intraspecific competitors on individual growth was at least twice as great as the effect of interspecific competitors. Growth rate was better predicted by measures of density that incorporated body size, rather than numerical density, suggesting interference competition. Individuals of both species interacted aggressively with conspecifics at least twice as often as with heterospecifics. Individuals of both species also covered more area while foraging and spent less time in shelter when crowded than when at lower densities. In combination, these behaviours suggest that increased metabolic costs at high density contribute to competitive effects on growth. These competitive interactions occurred among adult fishes, so reduced growth may translate to reduced fecundity as well as reduced survival, and so contribute to population regulation.

AB Variability in tropical estuarine sandy bottom fish faunas was investigated along a 200 km section of the northeast coast of tropical Australia at 3 nested spatial scales: among bays, among adjacent estuaries within bays, and among replicates within estuaries. Sampling was confined to a single habitat type, shallow sandy habitats, and a single class of estuaries, those with extensive areas of shallow sand in their lower reaches. This approach was employed to minimise the biases inherent in sampling estuaries containing varying proportions of the disparate habitat types that occur in tropical estuaries. The results showed: (1) the compositions of samples from all 9 estuaries in November 1999 were quite distinct from those in July 1999, July 2000 and July 2001; (2) there were no clear differences among estuaries during November 1999, but strong differences among estuaries every July, which were greater than differences among years; and (3) there was a greater difference at the scale of estuaries than at the larger spatial scale of 'bays', such that the differences among estuaries within bays were consistently greater than differences among bays. This pattern was consistent between seasons and among years in the same season. The clear estuary-to-estuary variability suggests that fauna of adjacent estuaries are likely to be no more similar than the faunas of estuaries hundreds of kilometres apart. This implies that no single estuary can be assumed to be a control site that can be used as a baseline against which to judge change in a different 'impacted' estuary.

AB Restoration of degraded forest ecosystems is critical to conservation, but it is unknown if all components can be successfully restored. Despite the obvious dependence of plant-dwelling arthropods on plants, there are few empirical tests to show if restoring the plants also restores the plant-dwelling arthropods, or if other factors inhibit recolonisation. This paper tests the congruence in reassembly trajectory between these two groups and the role of dispersal capabilities on arthropod recolonisation, using Hemiptera. Plants and arthropods were sampled along a chronosequence of individual mine pits representing increasing ages since restoration works, and surrounding unmined forest. Changes in the richness, composition and structural complexity of the vegetation are described. These data are compared to Hemiptera sampled by beating and vacuuming over 18 months. Following the initial establishment of vegetation, the richness of plant species remains at a plateau as pits age, and below that found in unmined forest. In contrast, some structural attributes of the vegetation in pits become more similar to the forest with time. As pits age, dead vegetation below 20 cm thickens and living midstorey vegetation thins. Plant species composition changes with time but is not tracking directly toward unmined forest. The abundance and richness of hemipteran species remain constant as pits age (similar to 74.5 species), at a similar value to that in the forest. Recolonisation by Hemiptera that are brachypterous (with permanently reduced wings) is markedly slower than for winged taxa. That said, the compositions of plant and hemipteran species follow a similar trajectory after mining (i.e., there is high congruence between the two taxa). Hemipteran species composition in the oldest pits sampled (9-year-old) is not tracking directly toward that found in unmined forest. We conclude that for plant-dwelling arthropods, the early stages of reassembly are characterised by a high abundance of a generalist species and the slow recolonisation by specialist taxa and fauna with limited dispersal abilities (e.g., brachypters). Thereafter, return to a composition similar to that prior to the disturbance depends upon the progress of vegetation reassembly. To obtain plant-dwelling arthropod assemblages characteristic of unmined forest, restoration must reinstate the plant species and structural complexity of the vegetation found in the forest (particularly long-lived species and ground covers).

AB Lutzomyia longipalpis, a sibling complex, is the main vector of Leishmania chagasi/infantum. Discriminating between siblings is important as they may differ in vectorial capacity. Lutzomyia longipalpis populations display distinct male sex pheromone chemotypes. We investigated the phylogeographic pattern of variation at microsatellite loci from 11 populations from Brazil and Venezuela related to their male pheromone. Temporal genetic differentiation was mostly not significant at the same site. Spatial genetic differentiation was, however, strong, although there was only a weak relationship between genetic differentiation and the geographic distance separating the samples (r(2) < 0.10); geographic separation explained a much greater (54-97%) percentage of the genetic differences among populations when samples with the same pheromone type were analyzed separately. A cluster analysis showed five groups: Lit. cruzi (Brazil) and Lu. pseudolongipalpis (Venezuela) as separate species, two (mostly 9-methyl-germacrene-B) Venezuelan and Brazilian groups, and a very distinct cluster of Brazilian cembrene populations.

AB In species of great conservation concern, special attention must be paid to their phylogeography, in particular the origin of animals for captive breeding and reintroduction. The endangered European mink lives now in at least three well-separated populations in northeast, southeast and west Europe. Our aim is to assess the genetic structure of these populations to identify 'distinct population segments' (DPS) and advise captive breeding programmes. First, the mtDNA control region was completely sequenced in 176 minks and 10 polecats. The analysis revealed that the western population is characterized by a single mtDNA haplotype that is closely related to those in eastern regions but nevertheless, not found there to date. The northeast European animals are much more variable (pi = 0.012, h = 0.939), with the southeast samples intermediate (pi = 0.0012, h = 0.469). Second, 155 European mink were genotyped using six microsatellites. The latter display the same trends of genetic diversity among regions as mtDNA [gene diversity and allelic richness highest in northeast Europe (H-E = 0.539, R-S = 3.76), lowest in west Europe (H-E = 0.379, R-S = 2.12)], and provide evidences that the southeast and possibly the west populations have undergone a recent bottleneck. Our results indicate that the western population derives from a few animals which recently colonized this region, possibly after a human introduction. Microsatellite data also reveal that isolation by distance occurs in the western population, causing some inbreeding because related individuals mate. As genetic data indicate that the three populations have not undergone independent evolutionary histories for long (no phylogeographical structure), they should not be considered as distinct DPS. In conclusion, the captive breeding programme should use animals from different parts of the species' present distribution area.

AB Pfiesteria shumwayae Glasgow et Burkholder is assigned to a new genus Pseudopfiesteria gen. nov. Plate tabulation differences between Pfiesteria and Pseudopfiesteria gen. nov. as well as a maximum likelihood phylogenetic analysis based on rDNA sequence data warrant creation of this new genus. The Kofoidian thecal plate formula for the new genus is Po, cp, X, 4', 1a, 6 '', 6c, PC, 5+s, 5''', 0p, 2''''. In addition to having six precingular plates, P. shumwayae comb. nov. also has a distinctive diamond or rectangular-shaped anterior intercalary plate. Both Pfiesteria and Pseudopfiesteria gen. nov. are reassigned to the order Peridiniales based on an apical pore complex (APC) with a canal (X) plate that contacts a symmetrical 1', four to five sulcal plates, and the conservative hypothecal tabulation of 5''', 0p, and 2''''. These morphological characters and the life histories of Pfiesteria and Pseudopfiesteria are consistent with placement of both genera in the Peridiniales. Based on the plate tabulations for P. shumwayae, P. piscicida, and the closely related "cryptoperidiniopsoid" and "lucy" groups, the family Pfiesteriaceae is amended to include species with the following tabulation: 4-5', 0-2a, 5-6 '', 6c, PC, 5+s, 5''', 0p, and 2'''' as well as an APC containing a pore plate (Po), a closing plate (cp), and an X plate; the tabulation is expanded to increase the number of sulcal plates and to include a new plate, the peduncle cover (PC) plate. Members of the family have typical dinoflagellate life cycles characterized by a biflagellated free-living motile stage, a varying number of cyst stages, and the absence of multiple amoeboid stages.

AB On Caribbean coral reefs, some sponge species produce chemical defenses, while others do not and are non-fatally grazed by predatory fishes. It has been hypothesized that the latter may compensate for fish grazing by growing faster or rapidly healing wounds. Rates of wound-healing were measured for chemically defended and undefended tubular and vase-shaped sponges on patch reefs in the Florida Keys and Bahamas in 2002. Healing rates were significantly faster during the first few days of the experiment, with rates leveling off after the third day. Chemically undefended sponges healed at significantly faster rates (Callyspongia plicifera, 8% area regenerated per day; Callyspongia vaginalis, 6%; Niphates digitalis, 6%; Xestospongia muta, 6.5%) than chemically defended sponges (Cribrochalina vasculum, 2%; Ircinia campana, 2%; Verongula gigantea, 0%). Orientation of wounds relative to the tidal current had no influence on healing rates. Specimens of Niphates digitalis growing in tubular form had faster healing rates than individuals with vasiform shapes. Our results suggest that Caribbean reef sponges followed two different evolutionary trajectories: chemically defended species deter fish predation and have slow healing rates, while chemically undefended species allocate resources to rapid wound-healing in response to grazing.

AB The green and golden bell frog (Litoria aurea) was once a common Australian Hylid. Today, many populations are small and fragmented as a result of dramatic declines in distribution and abundance. We undertook a large-scale assessment of genetic structure and diversity in L. aurea using four species-specific microsatellite markers. Twenty-one locations were sampled from throughout the species range covering 1000 km of the east coast of Australia. Levels of allelic diversity and heterozygosity were high (uncorrected mean alleles/locus and H-E were 4.8-8.8 and 0.43-0.8, respectively) compared to other amphibian species and significant differences among sampled sites were recorded. Despite recent population declines, no sites displayed a genetic signature indicative of a population bottleneck. Significant genetic structuring (overall F-ST 0.172) was detected throughout the species range, but was relatively low compared to previous amphibian studies employing microsatellites. In addition we found that some areas sampled within continuous habitat showed evidence of weak genetic structuring (data subset F-ST 0.034). We conclude that maintaining areas of continuous habitat is critical to the conservation of the species and argue that population recovery and/or persistence in all areas sampled is possible if appropriate protection and management are afforded.

AB We reanalysed the spatial structure of the Scandinavian brown bear (Ursus arctos) population based on multilocus genotypes. We used data from a former study that had presumed a priori a specific population subdivision based on four subpopulations. Using two independent methods (neighbour-joining trees and Bayesian assignment tests), we analysed the data without any prior presumption about the spatial structure. A subdivision of the population into three subpopulations emerged from our study. The genetic pattern of these subpopulations matched the three geographical clusters of individuals present in the population. We recommend considering the Scandinavian brown bear population as consisting of three (instead of four) subpopulations. Our results underline the importance of determining genetic structure from the data, without presupposing a structure, even when there seems to be good reason to do so.

AB A bioclimatic model was used to simulate distributions of the dominant tree species on the Tibetan Plateau. The model is based on physiological constraints to alpine plant growth. The bioclimatic variables used in this model are: minimum temperature in the coldest month, maximum temperature in the warmest month, accumulated growing-season warmth, and minimum value of soil moisture availability in the growing season. A comparison was made between simulated current distributions of tree species and their actual natural distributions on the Tibetan Plateau. It was shown that there is good agreement between simulated current and actual natural distributions. The simulated current distribution areas of tree species such as Abies spectabilis, Picea likiangensis var. linzhiensis, Pinus densata, Larix griffithiana were a little larger than their actual distributions. For Quercus aquifolioides and the relict species Betula platyphylla, simulated areas were a little smaller than their actual distributions. Future distributions of dominant tree species were predicted under a climate scenario with a CO2 concentration of 500 ppmv in the year 2100. The distribution areas of Abies spectabilis, Picea likiangensis var. linzhiensis, Pinus densata, Larix griffithiana and Quercus aquifolioides would shift and extend towards the north and west under the future climate scenario. For Betula utilis, the distribution areas would shift towards the north but they would shrink.

AB A chronosequence of restiad peat bogs (dominated by Restionaceae) in the lowland warm temperate zone of the Waikato region, North Island, New Zealand, was sampled to identify the major environmental determinants of vegetation pattern and dynamics. Agglomerative hierarchical classification of vegetation data from 69 plots in nine different-aged bogs, initiated from c. 600 to c. 15,000 cal yr BP, identified eight groups. Six of these groups formed a sequence from sedges through Empodisma minus, the main peat-forming restiad species, to phases dominated by a second restiad species, Sporadanthus ferrugineus. The sequence reflected bog age and paralleled patterns of temporal succession over the last 15,000 years (from early successional sedges through mid-successional Empodisma to late successional Sporadanthus) derived from previous studies of plant macrofossils and microfossils in peat cores. This indicated that different-aged bogs in the Waikato region could be used to interpret temporal succession. The remaining two classificatory groups comprised plots from sites modified by drainage, fire, or weed invasion and currently dominated by non-restiad species. The relationships between environmental variables and the six groups representing restiad bog succession indicated that, as succession proceeds, von Post decomposition index and nutrients in the top 7.5 cm peat zone decrease. The most useful indicators of successional stage were von Post, total P, total N, and % ash. Environmental response curves of the dominant plant species separated the species along nutrient and peat decompositional gradients, with early successional species having wider potential environmental ranges than late successional species. Empodisma minus, a mid-successional species, also had a relatively wide environmental range, which probably contributes to its key role in restiad bog development.

AB In foliage of two hybrid poplars, clone DN-34 (Populus deltoides x P. nigra) and clone NM-6 (P. nigra x P. maximowiczii), we examined relationships between photosynthesis and severity of leaf spot induced by Marssonina brunnea f. sp. brunnea, a common disease of many tree species in the Populus genus with the potential to affect growth.
   Gas exchange was measured on asymptomatic and diseased foliage in monoculture stands of each clone. The equation Y = (1 - x)(beta) was used to characterize the relationship between relative photosynthesis (Y) and percent leaf spot (x), where beta represents the ratio between functional impairment and measured lesion area.
   Leaf photosynthesis was strongly and negatively correlated with leaf spot severity in both hybrids, and beta-values indicated that photosynthetic impairment extended beyond visibly damaged leaf tissue. However, large differences in beta between hybrids indicated differential photosynthetic consequences for a given leaf spot severity. For each hybrid, values of beta were positively related to photosynthetic photon flux density incident upon the leaf during gas exchange measurement.
   Declines in leaf photosynthesis appeared to result from a disruption of the photosynthetic apparatus by the invading pathogen. However, specific causes for the differential photosynthetic responses of the two hybrids to disease remained elusive.

AB Biological invasion is one aspect of ecosystem function that may be controlled by the biological diversity of the invaded community, and there have been a number of recent studies that investigated relationships between diversity and invasibility. Most experimental studies report that higher species or functional group diversity increases resistance to invasion, but the role of genetic diversity is unknown. We used a model organism, Arabidopsis thaliana (Brassicaceae), to investigate relationships between genotypic richness and community invasibility by creating communities with 1, 2, 4, and 8 genotypes of A. thaliana at constant low (417 plants m(-2)) and high (834 plants m(-2)) densities, that once established, were invaded with a congener, Arabidopsis suecica. To reduce the potential effects of methodological confounding related to "sampling effects," "variance reduction effects," or confounding of abundance with diversity, we (1) created random communities from a relatively large pool of functionally and phenotypically similar genotypes, (2) evaluated individual and community traits across richness treatments, and (3) analyzed similarity of communities within treatments (for "quasi- replication") and between adjacent treatments (for "nestedness"). Genotypic richness had no effect on A. suecica demography (emergence, survivorship), size (biomass, rosette area), or reproductive potential (rates of bolting and fruiting or number and size of bolts). In contrast, the density of A. thaliana genotypes had strong effects on the size and reproductive potential of A. suecica, which suggests that characteristics of the recipient community other than genotypic richness (e.g. light) form the most important determinant of community invasibility. Individual- and community-level traits of community members (cover, biomass, survivorship) did not differ among richness treatments, and within- and between-treatment similarity was reduced (relative to other recent experiments) but not eliminated. We evaluate our results vis-a-vis recent analyses of diversity-invasibility experiments, and provide directions for future investigations of genetic diversity.

   RECRUITMENT; PREDATION; ABUNDANCE; DEMOGRAPHY; DAMSELFISH; DYNAMICS
AB Elucidating the causes of post-recruitment mortality is a vital step toward understanding the population dynamics of coral reef fishes. Predation is often considered to be the primary proximate cause of mortality. It has, however, proven difficult to discern the relative contributions of predation and other processes, such as competition for food, shelter, or mates, to patterns of mortality. To determine which other processes might be important drivers of mortality patterns, factors related to mortality in the clown anemonefish Amphiprion percula (Lacepede, 1802) were examined. Patterns of mortality will not be driven by predation in A. percula, because these fish are well protected from predators by their close association with sea anemones. Mortality rates were based on the disappearance of known individuals from a population of 201, in 57 groups, during a 1-year field study (in 1997), in Madang Lagoon, Papua New Guinea. Mortality rate of A. percula was low (14% per annum) compared to other coral reef fish, probably due to the protection from predators afforded by the anemone. Six factors (reef, depth, anemone diameter, number of individuals, density, and standard length) showed no association with the probability of mortality (P>0.05). Rank was the only factor associated with the probability of mortality (P<0.03); low-rank individuals (ranks 4-6) suffered a higher mortality rate than high-rank individuals (ranks 1-3) (P<0.01). The most likely explanation for this pattern was that competition for rank, amongst individuals within an anemone, resulted in some individuals evicting their subordinates. Individuals probably competed for rank because it conferred access to reproduction, and not because it conferred access to food or shelter. Such competition for reproduction will be intense whenever some individuals obtain a greater share of reproduction than others do, and it may be an important process influencing the dynamics of coral reef fish populations.

   COEXISTENCE; HABITAT; BIRDS
AB In bird migration systems, the question of coexistence and competition of migrants with residents in the nonbreeding season and their role in shaping the evolution of present avian communities is much debated. However, conclusions are often drawn in a speculative way. In the Palearctic-African bird migration system, many studies have addressed the question of coexistence of Palearctic breeding birds with Afrotropical species in the former's wintering grounds. These studies have led to some generalizations concerning habitat selection and foraging ecology about the traits that might enable migrants to coexist with residents. Migrants were therefore assumed to forage in more open habitats, in more peripheral parts of the vegetation and with a higher foraging speed than residents. Furthermore, they were also assumed to be more flexible in foraging behavior by using a wider range of foraging tactics, but some studies revealed contradicting results. We studied the ecology of Palearctic migrants in Comoe National Park, Ivory Coast, West Africa, during three successive winters to explore the factors of niche partitioning between migrants and residents and to test the hypothesis of whether there are common behavioral traits in migrants. Therefore, we compared the ecology of two Palearctic breeding species: pied flycatcher, Ficedula hypoleuca, and willow warbler, Phylloscopus trochilus, with resident members of the respective guilds. With respect to use of microhabitat, foraging speed, and intake rates, we could not confirm the above-mentioned generalizations, showing that care has to be taken into account when drawing conclusions from few studies for a whole migration system on a huge continent. However, both migrating species were more flexible in foraging behavior than were their Afrotropical counterparts. As there are hints that this is also the case when migrants are compared with residents on their breeding grounds, we suggest that this flexibility enables migrants to partition resources with residents and, therefore, coexist with Afrotropical species. We discuss, however, whether this flexibility is an adaptation to migratory behavior or a prerequisite for the evolution of migration. The role that competition plays in present communities cannot be solved with a few observational studies because of the following problems. First, it is difficult to detect competition in the field. Second, there are constraints of performing field experiments that have not previously been performed in Africa, and third, there are several possible hypothetical scenarios about the role of competition in shaping present communities, including factors that might have been important in the past and are therefore impossible to detect at present.

AB The evidence for structuring of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) and brown trout (Salmo trutta) into distinct reproductive populations and for genetic differentiation and local adaptation is compelling. The effect of genetic variation among populations is demonstrably a factor determining the economic value of salmonid fisheries in the British Isles. Genetic considerations are, therefore, a matter of self-interest for fisheries managers and a shared interest with those advocating more general approaches to the conservation of diversity and variation. The local population is the basic unit of production and, therefore, the preferred unit of management. However, salmonid populations are numerous and many are small. These factors limit practical possibilities for management at the population level. We suggest that this difficulty can be addressed by combining populations in fisheries-biased management units that comprise interchangeable, nested groupings of populations that are both genetically and biologically meaningful. This population-based approach addresses the necessity of managing the fisheries in ways that are consistent with the conservation of adaptive potential in relation to the dynamic aspects of populations, their capacity to respond to changing environmental conditions, and the likelihood that salmonids will remain a worthwhile resource for the future.

AB The effects that competing vegetation and nitrogen limitation have on the current annual increment (CAI), leaf biomass, and growth efficiency (GE) of different aged loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) stands planted on a Piedmont and lower Coastal Plain location in Georgia, U.S.A. were determined by measuring stands receiving a factorial combination of complete interspecific competition control and annual nitrogen fertilization. At the Piedmont location, CAI increased with age (5, 10, and 12 years) as well as fertilization (7.3-9.2 Mg.ha(-1)) and competition control (6.8-9.6 Mg.ha(-1)). The effects of fertilization on leaf biomass increased with stand age (no difference at age 5 to 1.5 Mg.ha(-1) difference at age 12), while the effects of competition control on leaf biomass decreased with stand age (difference of 2.5 Mg.ha(-1) at age 5 to difference of 1.6 Mg.ha(-1) at age 12). At the Coastal Plain location, fertilization increased CAI from 10.3 to 14.8 Mg.ha(-1). Leaf biomass increased with competition control (4.9-5.5 Mg.ha(-1)) and fertilization (4.4-6.0 Mg.ha(-1)). Leaf biomass increased with stand age for the fertilized stands (5.3-7.0 Mg.ha(-1) between age 7 and 13) and decreased with stand age for nonfertilized stands (4.9-4.0 Mg.ha(-1) between age 7 and 13). At the Coastal Plain location, fertilization increased the GE of the age-7 stands from 2.34 to 2.86 but decreased the GE of the age-13 stands from 2.32 to 2.14. In general, GE decreased as mean tree size increased indicating that changes in GE related to treatments may be confounded with changes in tree size. Results of this experiment emphasize the importance of nutrition on stand growth as fertilization increased leaf biomass and may increase stem production per unit of foliage at early stages of development.

TI Heat and mosquitoes cause breeding failures and adult mortality in an

AB We report on variation in rates of egg loss among Brunnich's Guillemot Uria lomvia breeding at Coats Island, northern Hudson Bay, in 1997-1999, and on several cases of adult mortality during incubation in the same years. Common factors in the dates of peak egg loss and adult mortality were high maximum daily temperatures and the presence of high numbers of mosquitoes in the area. Mortality was confined to breeding sites close to the edge of the colony, where mosquito parasitism was highest, and to those sites exposed to afternoon sunshine. High temperatures that occurred on days without mosquitoes were not associated with high egg losses or with adult mortality. Hence, it appears that a combination of heat and mosquitoes was necessary to bring about observed mortality and egg losses. The dates of first appearance and peak abundance of mosquitoes at Coats Island have advanced since the mid-1980s, perhaps in response to ongoing climate change. The effects on breeding Brunnich's Guillemots suggest that the birds have not had time to adjust their behaviour to the resulting changes in the timing of peak mosquito parasitism.

AB Dispersal patterns were investigated in the common wombat Vombatus ursinus using microsatellite genetic data collected from three study sites. Two of these were within large, high-density populations in Victoria, south-eastern Australia, while the third was a small, isolated population in South Australia. Genetic assignment tests revealed that in the continuous populations, females were more likely to be immigrants into the sampling areas than were males, who were more likely to have been born locally. No such difference between the sexes was detected for the isolated population. At all three sites, pairwise relatedness estimates for males were negatively correlated with geographic distance, suggesting related males were clustered. This pattern was not observed among females, other than in the isolated population, where pairs of females showed a weak decline of relatedness with increasing geographic distance over a large spatial scale. Taken together, these data provide strong evidence that dispersal is predominantly by females. Furthermore, the observed spatial structure of relatedness suggests female breeding dispersal a rare finding among mammalian species. Genetic variation within the isolated population was significantly reduced compared to the sites in Victoria. Our data are not sufficient to distinguish between two possible causes for this: (1) long-term small size and isolation of populations at the edge of the species' range where resources may be more patchily distributed; (2) a genetic bottleneck effect of recent isolation resulting from agricultural development.

AB Photosynthesis and related leaf characteristics were measured in canopies of co-occurring Quercus rubra L. (red oak), Quercus prinus L. (chestnut oak) and Acer rubrum L. (red maple) trees. Mature (20+ m tall) trees were investigated at sites of differing soil water availability within a catchment (a drier upper site and a wetter lower site). Leaf photosynthetic characteristics differed significantly between species and in response to site and position in the canopy. Photosynthetic capacity (A(max)) was significantly greater at the wetter site in all canopy strata in A. rubrum but not in Q. rubra or Q. prinus. Our findings for A. rubrum are generally consistent with those predicting that species with higher specific leaf area (SLA) will have higher A(max) per unit leaf nitrogen (N) and that species with leaves with lower SLA (e.g. Q. rubra and Q. prinus) will have shallower slopes of the A(max)-N relationship. Importantly, the relationships between A(max) and N-area (and by implication photosynthetic nitrogen-use efficiency, PNUE) differed in A. rubrum between the sites, with PNUE significantly lower at the drier site. The lower photosynthetic capacity and PNUE must substantially reduce carbon acquisition capacity in A. rubrum under these field conditions. Maximum stomatal conductance (g(smax)) differed significantly between species, with g(smax) greatest in Q. rubra and Q. prinus. In Q. rubra and Q. prinus, g(smax) was significantly lower at the upper site than the lower site. There was no significant response of g,. to site in A. rubrum. These stomatal responses were consistent with the C-i/C-a ratio, which was significantly lower in leaves of Q. rubra and Q. prinus at the upper site, but did not differ between sites in A. rubrum. Leaf delta(13)C was significantly lower in A. rubrum than in either Q. rubra or Q. prinus at both sites. These findings indicate differences in stomatal behaviour in A. rubrum which are likely to contribute to lower water use efficiency at both sites. Our results support the hypothesis that the two Quercus species, in contrast to A. rubrum, maintain photosynthetic capacity at the drier site whilst minimising transpirational water loss. They also suggest, based primarily on physiological evidence, that the ability of A. rubrum to compete with other species of these deciduous forests may be limited, particularly in sites of low moisture availability and during low rainfall years.

AB Genetic diversity was investigated among California populations of Botryosphaeria dothidea, causal agent of Botryosphaeria panicle and shoot blight of pistachio, with random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and microsatellite-primed polymerase chain reaction (MP-PCR). We surveyed 120 isolates, 112 of which originated from the California Central Valley and included pistachio isolates (n = 52) and isolates from other plant species (n = 60). Our-group isolates (n = 8) were obtained from pistachio in Greece. There was a strong correlation (r = 0.99; P < 0.0001) between the RAPD- and MP-PCR dissimilarity data sets. Little genetic variation (haplotypic diversity [Hs] < 0.002) was detected among B. dothidea isolates collected from central and southern California pistachio plantings. We observed relatively high diversity for isolates from a northern California pistachio orchard (Hs = 0.0146), where the disease was first diagnosed, and from the Chico U.S. Department of Agriculture Germ Plasm Repository (Hs = 0.0726), where the first pistachio trees were planted in California in 1929. Isolates obtained from other hosts, especially those associated with the rare occurrence of the sexual stage of this fungus, showed the highest levels of diversity (Hs = 0.1689). Thirty-eight pistachio isolates (73.1%) had DNA fingerprints identical to 28 pycnidiospore-derived isolates (56.0%) obtained from other host species. Greenhouse inoculations demonstrated that all isolates obtained from other hosts were capable of infecting pistachio and produced characteristic disease symptomology. Thus, California populations of B. dothidea from pistachio are, for the most part, genetically uniform, with the sexual stage rare to absent. However, the rare occurrence of the sexual stage of B. dothidra on other hosts, and more importantly, the capacity of these isolates to infect pistachio, indicate that other host species may serve as sources of inoculum and genetic variation.

AB Most documented extinctions of vertebrates in the last 400 years have been island endemics. In this paper, we focus on the need to develop a historical framework to establish conservation priorities for insular faunas and, in particular, to test the validity of nominal endemics. We use the example of the islands of the North Pacific Coast (NPC) of North America, a region that includes approximately one-half of all mammals endemic to North American islands north of Mexico (seven species and 67 subspecies). Few of these endemics have been re-evaluated since their original descriptions, although many of these islands have been heavily impacted by habitat conversion, species introductions, over-exploitation, and secondary ripple effects. Evidence from molecular genetics and paleontology suggests that many taxa arrived in the region since the last glacial advance. Some of these nominal endemics show minimal differentiation, while others comprise multiple evolutionary lineages. The NPC may also have played an important role in the in situ diversification of some taxa (paleoendemics) during the Pleistocene. Evidence, such as new fossil discoveries and numerous described endemics, lends support for refugia hypotheses. However, these ideas cannot be tested until a better understanding of geographic variation and the evolutionary relationships of the fauna and flora of the North Pacific Coast is developed. This framework would provide significant insight into the dynamic biogeographic history of the region and help prioritize conservation efforts. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Photosynthetic nitrogen-use efficiency (PNUE, photosynthetic capacity per unit leaf nitrogen) varies among species from different habitats and correlates with several ecological characteristics such as leaf life span and leaf mass per area. We investigated eight evergreen broad-leaved woody species with different leaf life spans that coexist in a warm-temperate forest. We determined photosynthetic capacity at ambient CO2 concentration in saturated light, nitrogen concentration, and the concentration of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase (RuBPCase), a key enzyme of photosynthesis and the largest sink of nitrogen in leaves. Each species showed a strong correlation between photosynthetic capacity and RuBPCase concentration, and between RuBPCase concentration and nitrogen concentration. Photosynthetic capacity of leaves decreased with increasing leaf life span, whereas PNUE did not correlate significantly with leaf life span. There was a two-fold variation in PNUE among species. This relatively small variation in PNUE is consistent with the argument that species that coexist in a single habitat maintain a similar PNUE. The two components of PNUE-photosynthetic rate per unit RuBPCase and RuBPCase per unit leaf nitrogen-were not significantly correlated with other leaf characteristics such as leaf life span and leaf mass per area. We conclude that differences in PNUE are relatively small among coexisting species and that differences in absolute amounts of photosynthetic proteins lead to differences in photosynthetic productivity among species.

AB Concern has been raised that the widely used spawning stock biomass might not be a sensitive index of the reproductive potential of fish populations. On the other hand, there is increasing evidence that fishing affects life history traits of fish. Fish compensate for fishing mortality by faster growth, earlier maturity and increased fecundity. Because life history traits are affected by fishing and are also critical in determining the population growth rate, they may be used as indices of population viability. In this paper, the traits that meet both criteria are investigated among age-at-maturity, fecundity and growth. In the framework of matrix population models, the life table response experiments (LTRE) method is used to quantify the effects of fishing on demographic parameters, and the contributions of these effects to the population growth rate. This approach is used for comparing parameters and population growth rates of flatfish populations between periods with different fishing pressure, it is found that age-at-maturity, the proportion of repeat spawners in the spawning stock and some proxy for lifetime fecundity may be used as indices of population viability.

AB We used the predictions of the ideal free and ideal despotic distributions (IFD and IDD, respectively) as a basis to evaluate the link between spatial heterogeneity, behavior, and population dynamics in a Caribbean coral reef fish. Juvenile three-spot damselfish (Stegastes planifrons) were more closely aggregated in patch reef habitat than on continuous back reef. Agonistic interactions were more frequent but feeding rates were lower in the patch versus the continuous reef habitat. Growth rates were lower in patch reef habitat than on the continuous reef, but mortality rates did not differ. A separate experiment using standard habitat units demonstrated that the patterns observed in natural habitat were the result of the spatial distribution of the habitat patches rather than resource differences between habitats. Our results do not follow the predictions of simple IFD or IDD models. This deviation from IFD and IDD predictions may be the result of a number of factors, including lack of perfect information about habitat patches, high movement costs, and higher encounter rates of dispersed patches. Our results demonstrate that behavioral interactions are an integral part of population dynamics and that it is necessary to consider the spatial organization of the habitat in both behavioral and ecological investigations.

AB Development of conservation strategies for Fraser fir (Abies fraseri) in the southern Appalachian Mountains depends in part on recognition of the extent to which Fraser fir is genetically distinct from the closely related balsam (A. balsamea) and intermediate (A. balsamea var. phanerolepis) fir. These sibling species have exhibited intergrading. clinal variation in morphological, chemical, and genetic characteristics in prior research. Chloroplast microsatellite markets were polymerase chain reaction amplified from genomic DNA samples of 78 individuals representing the geographic ranges of Fraser, balsam, and intermediate fir. Gene diversity levels at two loci ranged among taxa from 0.65 to 0.84. Allele frequencies demonstrated significant differentiation among taxa. with R-ST values of 0.36 and 0.10. Haplotype diversity and D-SH(2) were highest for balsam fir and lowest for intermediate fir. A haplotype network analysis based on allele size distribution fur the two loci revealed two distinct clusters of haplotypes and population-specific: haplotypes. Ninety-two percent of the haplotypes in one cluster were from balsam fir and intermediate Br, and 84% of the haplotypes in the other cluster were from Fraser fir and intermediate fir. The genetic differentiation of chloroplast DNA markers provides justification for the recognition of Fraser fir as a distinct Management Unit (MU) for conservation purposes, regardless of its taxonomic classification.

AB This study investigates factors determining variation in photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency (phi(N)) in seven slow- and fast-growing Poa species from altitudinally contrasting sites. The species and their environmental origin were (in order of increasing relative growth rate): two alpine (Poa fawcettiae and P. costiniana), one sub-alpine (P. alpina) and three temperate lowland perennials (P. pratensis, P. compressa and P. trivialis), as well as one temperate lowland annual (P. annua). Plants were grown hydroponically under identical conditions with free access to nutrients in a growth room. Photosynthesis per unit leaf area measured at growth irradiance (500 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) was slightly higher in the slow-growing alpine species. At saturating light intensities, photosynthesis was considerably higher in the alpine species than in the lowland species. Carboxylation capacity and Rubisco content per unit leaf area were also greater in the alpine species. Despite variation between the species, the in vivo specific activity of Rubisco showed little relationship to relative growth rate or photosynthetic rate. Both at light saturation and at the growth irradiance, phi(N) was lowest in the slow-growing alpine species P. fawcettiae, P. costiniana and P. alpina, and highest in the fast-growing P. compressa and P. annua. The proportion of leaf nitrogen that was allocated to photosynthetic capacity and the in vivo catalytic constant of Rubisco accounted for most of the variation in phi(N) at light saturation. Minor variations in intercellular CO2 partial pressure also contributed to some extent to the variations in phi(N) at light saturation. The low phi(N) values at growth irradiance exhibited by the alpine species were additionally due to a lower percentage utilisation of their high photosynthetic capacity compared to the lowland species.

TI Identification of evolutionary significant units in the Spanish wild

SO ANIMAL CONSERVATION
LA English
DT Article
AB The Pyrenean population of Spanish wild goat (Capra pyrenaica pyrenaica) is nearly extinct. To find the most appropriate source of individuals for supplementing the Pyrenean population, we identified Evolutionary Significant Units (ESUs) among populations of the Capra pyrenaica species. We have examined sequence variability of portions of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region and cytochrome b (cyt b) gene. Samples were from seven populations of Spanish wild goat distributed over the species' geographic range. The level of divergence between the Pyrenean and other Spanish haplotypes is almost as high as the divergence between the Alpine (C. ibex ibex) and the Spanish wild goats. In addition, the Pyrenean goat is morphologically distinct from other Spanish wild goats. Therefore the Pyrenean population should be considered as an ESU. For the reinforcement, we suggest either using individuals from the most polymorphic Spanish population, or mixing individuals from diverse Spanish origins, since all the other Spanish populations are equally genetically distant from the Pyrenean population.

AB This paper assesses the potential effectiveness of the visible implant fluorescent elastomer (VIFE) tagging system for identifying groups of snapper (Pagrus auratus: Sparidae) in the field. Retention rate after surface tagging longline-caught fish was 93% over a 2-week period, with no mortality attributable to tagging. Incidence of fin or scale infection did not differ between tagged and control fish. A protocol for tagging snapper underwater was also developed. This technique caused less stress to the fish than remote fishing methods, but was labour intensive when large sample sizes were required. Orange VIFE tags were visible to divers at ranges of up to 6 m in water visibility of 8-10 m, when exposed to light frequencies capable of inducing fluorescent emissions. Red, green, and yellow tags were only identifiable at shorter ranges, depending on ambient light levels and direction. The range of tag detection increased with increasing water clarity. We suggest that VIFE tagging has better retention rates and is less intrusive compared with previously employed externally readable tags. Because tags are identifiable in situ without the necessity of recapture, this method has potentially wide-ranging applications in fish ecology and behavioural studies for adult as well as juvenile fishes.

AB To test whether variation in body size and relative head dimensions may be a phenotypically plastic response to feeding experience in snakes, we assigned neonate water snakes, Nerodia sipedon, from four litters (n = 48) to two feeding treatment groups. One group was offered one large minnow twice weekly; the other group was offered two small minnows twice weekly. Body size (snout-vent length, mass) and head dimensions (head length, head width, jaw length, interocular distance) were measured at the beginning of the experiment and upon completion of the experiment 20 weeks later. Repeated-measures multivariate analysis of variance revealed significant effects of feeding treatment, sex, and family on change in body size. Repeated-measures MANCOVA (with body length as covariate) also revealed a significant effect due to family on change in head dimensions. The multivariate effect of feeding treatment on head dimensions approached statistical significance (P = 0.102); the univariate effect of feeding treatment was significant for jaw length (P = 0.010). Females increased in body size more than males did, and snakes offered large fish increased in body size and jaw length more than snakes offered small fish. These results suggest that body size and jaw length respond plastically to amount and size of prey.

AB We have examined phylogenetic and geographic patterns of variation in the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene of Southern Hemisphere fur seals (Arctocephalus spp,), Our survey of 106 individuals from four putative species reveals three distinct patterns of variation reflecting ancient, recent historic, and contemporary gene flow, For the combined samples of Subantarctic (Arctocephalus tropicalis) and Antarctic (Arctocephalus gazella) fur seals, we find low levels of sequence diversity and reciprocal paraphyly of haplotypes (where representative haplotypes of a species are found to occur infrequently in another species and vice versa), For the Australian and Cape fur seal subspecies (Arctocephalus pusillus doriferus and A. p. pusillus, respectively), we find low levels of sequence diversity but significant differences in the regional distribution of haplotypes that are consistent with, but not conclusive of, the current subspecies definition based on nonmolecular data, For the New Zealand fur seal (Arctocephalus forsteri), we find high levels of average sequence diversity because of the survival of two divergent lineages of mitochondrial haplotypes with differences approaching that found in interspecific comparisons of other mammals, The two divergent clades are distributed sympatrically in some regions, but the overall geographic structure of the variation is significant across the range of this species, These new molecular data are inconsistent with current taxonomic definitions of species within the Southern Hemisphere fur seals and argue for reevaluation of these ''species'' definitions, For management purposes, the definition of evolutionarily significant units (Ryder 1986) and genetic management units (Moritz 1994) in relation to these species may also be evaluated in light of this molecular genetic information.

AB Stands of bambara groundnut (Vigna subterranea (L.) Verdc.) were grown in five controlled-environment glasshouses at the Tropical Crops Research Unit, University of Nottingham, Sutton Bonington Campus, in 1990. Five soil moisture regimes were imposed (one per house), from fully irrigated each week (treatment A), to no irrigation after crop establishment at 35 days after sowing (DAS) (treatment E). Decreasing the amount of water applied resulted in a decline in total dry matter production and harvest index, and a reduction in pod yield from 4.12 (treatment B) to 0.04 t ha(-1) (treatment E) at 125 DAS. A maximum leaf area index of 5.4 was achieved by treatments B and C at 90 DAS, resulting in a fractional interception of c. 0.8 of incoming radiation. Total accumulated radiation interception values were 749, 693, 688, 618 and 554 MJ m(-2) for treatments A, B, C, D and E, respectively. The efficiency of conversion of the radiation intercepted into dry matter was reduced from 1.41 to 0.50 g MJ(-1) by drought.

AB Settlement, growth and post-settlement mortality of the cunner (Tautogolabrus adspersus Walbaum) was investigated on isolated boulder reefs in St. Margaret's Bay, Nova Scotia. Populations of cunner on these reefs were subjected to experimental manipulations of adult and recruit population density. Settlement of cunner was unaffected by the density of prior resident adults. Elevation of adult densities to approximately twice natural levels resulted in complete mortality of newly settled fish, while removal of adults resulted in enhanced growth and recruitment success over natural populations. This clearly demonstrates that natural populations of cunner in St. Margaret's Bay are sufficiently high to result in density-dependent growth and post-settlement mortality. Growth and mortality of newly settled fish were also suppressed by high recruit densities and enhanced by low densities of conspecific recruits. On all study reefs, newly settled cunner formed social dominance hierarchies, and both growth rate and post-settlement survival were positively correlated with fish size. Recruitment success of species such as cunner, for which post-settlement mortality is size-dependent, may be strongly influenced by processes affecting growth rate.

AB The swamp rat (Rattus lutreolus) and the eastern chestnut mouse (Pseudomys gracilicaudatus) occupy the same coastal wet heath habitat in eastern Australia. Previous experimental removals have demonstrated asymmetric interspecific competition with the larger R. lutreolus excluding the smaller P. gracilicaudatus from preferred habitat and reducing its abundance. We report the results of a reciprocal manipulation experiment in summer with the abundance of the smaller P. gracilicaudatus being depressed by removals over a 40 d period, the abundance of the larger R. lutreolus increased more rapidly (p < 0.025) on the three experimental sites than on the three control sites. In the final trapping session of the removal period there was a significant difference (t = 2.67, p = 0.028, 1-tail) in R. lutreolus abundance on experimental (7.33 +/- 1.20) and control (3.67 +/- 0.67) sites. There were again no differences between these sites when retrapped 107 d after the removals ceased.
   A further reciprocal experiment removing P. gracilicaudatus was conducted in winter and failed to provide any evidence for the competitive release demonstrated by R. lutreolus in the summer experiment. We make comparisons between the results of these two experiments, which allows us to confirm that body size difference provides the mechanism which facilitates this asymmetric competition and determines access to better habitat. We analyse the response by R. lutreolus for two size classes separately, large (animals heavier than the largest P. gracilicaudatus) and small (lighter individuals). Interspecific competition in summer can be attributed to the small R. lutreolus size class alone, but, in winter neither size class exhibits competitive release. Normal growth of juveniles between summer and winter reduces the number of small R. lutreolus and also the intensity of competition with P. gracilicadatus. Only small R. lutreolus are vulnerable to competition with P gracilicaudatus and large individuals remain unaffected. The different outcomes of such competition are determined by the size class structure of the larger species, thus producing seasonally variable interspecific competition.

AB Shoots of the monocotyledonous perennial Carex acutiformis were grown in open (28 shoots m-2) and dense stands (280 shoots m-2). For fully grown stands the distribution of relative PPFD and leaf nitrogen per unit leaf area over canopy depth was determined. Light response of photosynthesis was measured on leaf segments sampled at various heights in the stands. Relations between parameters of these curves and leaf nitrogen were investigated.
   Simulations showed that in the open stand daily canopy photosynthesis was not affected by nitrogen redistribution in the canopy. For the dense stand however, a uniform nitrogen distribution would lead to only 73% of the maximum net carbon gain by the stand under optimal nitrogen distribution. The actual canopy photosynthesis was only 7% less than this theoretical maximum; the actual nitrogen distribution of the dense stand clearly tended to the optimal distribution. The vertical pattern of the nitrogen distribution was to a large extent determined by the minimum leaf nitrogen content. The relatively high minimum leaf nitrogen content found for Carex leaves may perhaps be necessary to maintain the physiological function of the basal parts of the leaves.

AB This paper introduces three machine learning (ML) algorithms, the 'ensemble' Random Forest (RF), the 'ensemble' Gradient Boosted Regression Tree (GBRT) and the MultiLayer Perceptron neural network (MLP) and applies them to the spatial modelling of shallow landslides near Kvam in Norway. In the development of the ML models, a total of 11 significant landslide controlling factors were selected. The controlling factors relate to the geomorphology, geology, geo-environment and anthropogenic effects: slope angle, aspect, plan curvature, profile curvature, flow accumulation, flow direction, distance to rivers, water content, saturation, rainfall and distance to roads. It is observed that slope angle was the most significant controlling factor in the ML analyses. The performance of the three ML models was evaluated quantitatively based on the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis. The results show that the 'ensemble' GBRT machine learning model yielded the most promising results for the spatial prediction of shallow landslides, with a 95% probability of landslide detection and 87% prediction efficiency.

AB Fossil pollen records are well-established indicators of past vegetation changes. The prevalence of pollen across environmental settings including lakes, wetlands, and marine sediments, has made palynology one of the most ubiquitous and valuable tools for studying past environmental and climatic change globally for decades. A complementary research focus has been the development of statistical techniques to derive quantitative estimates of climatic conditions from pollen assemblages. This paper reviews the most commonly used statistical techniques and their rationale and seeks to provide a resource to facilitate their inclusion in more palaeoclimatic research. To this end, we first address the fundamental aspects of fossil pollen data that should be considered when undertaking pollen-based climate reconstructions. We then introduce the range of techniques currently available, the history of their development, and the situations in which they can be best employed. We review the literature on how to define robust calibration datasets, produce high-quality reconstructions, and evaluate climate reconstructions, and suggest methods and products that could be developed to facilitate accessibility and global usability. To continue to foster the development and inclusion of pollen climate reconstruction methods, we promote the development of reporting standards. When established, such standards should 1) enable broader application of climate reconstruction techniques, especially in regions where such methods are currently underused, and 2) enable the evaluation and reproduction of individual reconstructions, structuring them for the evolving open-science era, and optimising the use of fossil pollen data as a vital means for the study of past environmental and climatic variability. We also strongly encourage developers and users of palaeoclimate reconstruction methodologies to make associated programming code publicly available, which will further help disseminate these techniques to interested communities.

AB Soil is one of the most biodiverse terrestrial habitats. Yet, we lack an integrative conceptual framework for understanding the patterns and mechanisms driving soil biodiversity. One of the underlying reasons for our poor understanding of soil biodiversity patterns relates to whether key biodiversity theories (historically developed for aboveground and aquatic organisms) are applicable to patterns of soil biodiversity. Here, we present a systematic literature review to investigate whether and how key biodiversity theories (species-energy relationship, theory of island biogeography, metacommunity theory, niche theory and neutral theory) can explain observed patterns of soil biodiversity. We then discuss two spatial compartments nested within soil at which biodiversity theories can be applied to acknowledge the scale-dependent nature of soil biodiversity.

   SENSITIVITY; PROJECTIONS; SIMULATION; DRIVERS
AB High-resolution projections of climate change impacts on fire weather conditions in southeast Australia out to 2080 are presented. Fire weather is represented by the McArthur Forest Fire Danger Index (FFDI), calculated from an objectively designed regional climate model ensemble. Changes in annual cumulative FFDI vary widely, from -337 (-21%) to +657 (+24%) in coastal areas and -237 (-12%) to +1143 (+26%) in inland areas. A similar spread is projected in extreme FFDI values. In coastal regions, the number of prescribed burning days is projected to change from -11 to +10 in autumn and -10 to +3 in spring. Across the ensemble, the most significant increases in fire weather and decreases in prescribed burn windows are projected to take place in spring. Partial bias correction of FFDI leads to similar projections but with a greater spread, particularly in extreme values. The partially bias-corrected FFDI performs similarly to uncorrected FFDI compared to the observed annual cumulative FFDI (ensemble root mean square error spans 540 to 1583 for uncorrected output and 695 to 1398 for corrected) but is generally worse for FFDI values above 50. This emphasizes the need to consider inter-variable relationships when bias-correcting for complex phenomena such as fire weather. There is considerable uncertainty in the future trajectory of fire weather in southeast Australia, including the potential for less prescribed burning days and substantially greater fire danger in spring. Selecting climate models on the basis of multiple criteria can lead to more informative projections and allow an explicit exploration of uncertainty.

AB Drought is a constant and important consequence of natural climatic processes and most freshwater fishes have adaptations to counter its effects. However, a changing global climate coupled with increasing human demand for water is reducing the availability of fresh water to fishes and contributing to more frequent and intense drought around the globe. A clear understanding of how fishes, fish habitat, and fisheries are affected by extended drought is needed to help resolve conflicts over water. We therefore identify key questions and research themes to promote the conservation of freshwater fishes as drought increases in length, frequency and severity. (1) How does drought affect fish habitat? (2) What is drought tolerance in fishes? (3) What are drought refuges for fishes? (4) What kills fish during drought? (5) What is the nature of species succession in drought-stricken waters? (6) What are the long-term consequences of drought to fishes? (7) How does climate change affect drought-fish interactions? (8) How does drought influence fisheries? Our limited ability to provide answers to these questions indicates that fish diversity and abundance worldwide is threatened by drought. Planning, including collection of long-term data, is necessary so that conservation and water re-allocation strategies can be implemented in a timely manner to maintain habitats necessary to support biodiversity during drought periods. Without increased understanding of physiological and behavioural factors that determine the tolerance of fishes to drought, it will not be possible to establish realistic targets for management and restoration of populations and species confronting increasing drought frequency and severity.

AB Biotic resistance theory suggests that diverse cover crop mixes may be more effective at weed suppression than a cover crop monoculture. However, evidence for this has so far been inconsistent. To investigate, we designed a trial to explicitly test the role of cover crop diversity in weed suppression by comparing eight cover crop mixes that varied in species diversity, functional diversity, and composition. Mixes contained either one, four, or eight species, in equal proportions. Three mixes contained only cereal species, three contained only legumes, and two contained a mix of cereals, legumes, and brassicas. Research was conducted on two farms in South Africa's winter rainfall region, replicated over 2 yr. Indicators of resource uptake by each mix in terms of light, soil N, and water were measured at three time points throughout the season, approximately 50, 85, and 110 d after emergence (DAE). Above-ground biomass (dry weight) of cover crops and weeds within each mix was measured twice, at approximately 70 and 120 DAE. Regression analyses indicated that cover crop biomass was key to resource uptake and weed suppression, and that early-season N and later-season light availability had the strongest influence on weed biomass. Neither species diversity nor functional diversity affected resource uptake or weed suppression by cover crops. These results indicate that it is important to consider the competitiveness of individual species when designing cover crop mixes. Diverse mixes remain valuable to perform multiple functions but may contribute to weed problems if composed of poorly competitive species.

AB Continuing advances in whole genome scale approaches integrated with other omic' technologies promise to revolutionise understanding about the relevance of genetic variation to risks of species declines and extinctions. In the face of the vastly increased accessibility of such approaches, it is important that we advance beyond descriptive genetics to developing a more functional perspective on whether enhancing genetic variation is the most effective strategy for conservation management. Rather than a comprehensive review of the field, this paper focuses on several key issues that have been discussed since the dawn of conservation genetics and that warrant re-assessment based on emerging omics data, combined with new analytical approaches to ecological niche modelling and population genomic analyses. Specifically, the following inter-related issues are discussed: (1) the relative impacts of inbreeding and outbreeding on fitness and adaptive potential, particularly in relation to genetic rescue; (2) how species should be defined for conservation management; (3) deciding on how much and what type of genetic variation should be preserved; and (4) how we can move from descriptive genetics to actually understanding adaptive processes in the wild. None of the ideas presented are new; the purpose here is to serve as a reminder that many of the issues raised 30years ago are still relevant but not completely resolved and would benefit from tackling afresh with modern tools, but considering historical perspectives.

AB Wetlands in urban areas will be crucial to counteract the effects of climate change, for example, by improving flood protection and regulating local climate. To gain acceptance for larger-scale creation of wetlands, total values must be identified and revealed. Provisioning and regulating ecosystem services can be described as the quantitative effect, but cultural ecosystem services require other assessments. This study sought to determine whether peri-urban and urban wetland areas contribute to the well-being and quality of life of nearby residents, and to capture their value relative to two other types of green areas (i.e., parks and urban forests). A postal questionnaire survey, based on validated environmental psychology instruments, was distributed to residents in three municipalities with wetland areas of different structures and locations. In these municipalities, respondents (n = 474; response rate = 40%) reported that the wetland area contributed to several quality-of-life aspects, such as encountering nature and experiencing beauty. The areas also facilitated activities that support well-being, were perceived to have high restorative qualities, and evoked positive affective responses. All wetland areas were rated high on most of the measured concepts, but their value relative to other green areas differed possibly depending on the accessibility of the wetland and the availability of other green areas. The location and extent to which the wetland area was integrated in the residential area determined what quality-of-life aspects were most satisfied. Wetland areas can be ascribed cultural ecosystem service values based on how residents perceive their contribution to their quality of life. These values can be added to those of provisioning and regulating ecosystem services, forming the basis for planning urban environments. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Heavy metal contamination of soils has become a major global environmental problem. Previous studies have reported that hydroxyapatite has been extensively used to immobilize soil heavy metals, and the grain sizes of amendments affect the bioavailability and geochemical stability of heavy metals. However, it is not clear how soil microbial diversity and community composition in these soils vary with the application of hydroxyapatite. A field study was conducted to determine the effect of different grain sizes of hydroxyapatite on Cu and Cd bioavailability and microbial community composition. Results showed that micro-hydroxyapatite (MAP), nanohydroxyapatite (NAP) and normal hydroxyapatite (AP) increased soil pH and decreased soil exchangeable acid and exchangeable Al. Compared with the control, MAP was the most efficient in decreasing the CaCl2-extractable Cu and Cd by 97.5 and 86.5%, respectively, and exchangeable Cu and Cd by 82.4% and 27.4%, respectively. The soil microbial community composition varied with the amendments of different sizes, and the soil bacterial diversity increased after the amendment applications. Analysis of the network structure showed that fewer operational taxonomic units were enriched or depleted between the MAP- and NAP-amended soils, which explained the similarity between the MAP- and NAP-amended soils. These results suggest that MAP may be the best material for amending heavy metal-contaminated soils when considering immobilization efficiency and soil biological characteristics.

AB The xylem cavitation threshold water potential establishes a hydraulic limit on the ability of woody species to survive in water-limiting environments, but herbs may be more plastic in terms of their ability to adapt to drying conditions. Here, we examined the capacity of sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) leaves to adapt to reduced water availability by modifying the sensitivity of xylem and stomata to soil water deficit. We found that sunflower plants grown under water-limited conditions significantly adjusted leaf osmotic potential, which was linked to a prolongation of stomatal opening as soil dried and a reduced sensitivity of photosynthesis to water-stress-induced damage. At the same time, the vulnerability of midrib xylem to water-stress-induced cavitation was observed to be highly responsive to growth conditions, with water-limited plants producing conduits with thicker cell walls which were more resistant to xylem cavitation. Coordinated plasticity in osmotic potential and xylem vulnerability enabled water-limited sunflowers to safely extract water from the soil, while protecting leaf xylem against embolism. High plasticity in sunflower xylem contrasts with data from woody plants and may suggest an alternative strategy in herbs.

AB 1. Predicting population responses to environmental conditions or management scenarios is a fundamental challenge for conservation. Proper consideration of demographic, environmental and parameter uncertainties is essential for projecting population trends and optimal conservation strategies.
   2. We developed a coupled integrated population model-Bayesian population viability analysis to assess the (1) impact of demographic rates (survival, fecundity, immigration) on past population dynamics; (2) population viability 10 years into the future; and (3) efficacy of possible management strategies for the federally endangered Great Lakes piping plover Charadrius melodus population.
   3. Our model synthesizes long-term population survey, nest monitoring and mark-resight data, while accounting for multiple sources of uncertainty. We incorporated latent abundance of eastern North American merlins Falco columbarius, a primary predator of adult plovers, as a covariate on adult survival via a parallel state-space model, accounting for the influence of an imperfectly observed process (i.e. predation pressure) on population viability.
   4. Mean plover abundance increased from 18 pairs in 1993 to 75 pairs in 2016, but annual population growth ((lambda) over bar (t)) was projected to be 0.95 (95% CI 0.72-1.12), suggesting a potential decline to 67 pairs within 10 years. Without accounting for an expanding merlin population, we would have concluded that the plover population was projected to increase ((lambda) over bar (t)=1.02; 95% CI 0.94-1.09) to 91 pairs by 2026. We compared four conservation scenarios: (1) no proposed management; (2) increased control of chick predators (e.g. Corvidae, Laridae, mammals); (3) increased merlin control; and (4) simultaneous chick predator and merlin control. Compared to the null scenario, chick predator control reduced quasi-extinction probability from 11.9% to 8.7%, merlin control more than halved (3.5%) the probability and simultaneous control reduced quasi-extinction probability to 2.6%.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Piping plover recovery actions should consider systematic predator control, rather than current ad hoc protocols, especially given the predicted increase in regional merlin abundance. This approach of combining integrated population models with Bayesian population viability analysis to identify limiting components of the population cycle and evaluate alternative management strategies for conservation decision-making shows great utility for aiding recovery of threatened populations.

AB Urban ecosystems are widely hypothesized to be more ecologically homogeneous than natural ecosystems. We argue that urban plant communities assemble from a complex mix of horticultural and regional species pools, and evaluate the homogenization hypothesis by comparing cultivated and spontaneously occurring urban vegetation to natural area vegetation across seven major U.S. cities. There was limited support for homogenization of urban diversity, as the cultivated and spontaneous yard flora had greater numbers of species than natural areas, and cultivated phylogenetic diversity was also greater. However, urban yards showed evidence of homogenization of composition and structure. Yards were compositionally more similar across regions than were natural areas, and tree density was less variable in yards than in comparable natural areas. This homogenization of biodiversity likely reflects similar horticultural source pools, homeowner preferences, and management practices across U.S. cities.

AB Tropical tree species have evolved under very narrow temperature ranges compared to temperate forest species. Studies suggest that tropical trees may be more vulnerable to continued warming compared to temperate species, as tropical trees have shown declines in growth and photosynthesis at elevated temperatures. However, regional and global vegetation models lack the data needed to accurately represent such physiological responses to increased temperatures, especially for tropical forests. To address this need, we compared instantaneous photosynthetic temperature responses of mature canopy foliage, leaf temperatures, and air temperatures across vertical canopy gradients in three forest types: tropical wet, tropical moist, and temperate deciduous. Temperatures at which maximum photosynthesis occurred were greater in the tropical forests canopies than the temperate canopy (30 +/- 0.3 degrees C vs. 27 +/- 0.4 degrees C). However, contrary to expectations that tropical species would be functioning closer to threshold temperatures, photosynthetic temperature optima was exceeded by maximum daily leaf temperatures, resulting in sub-optimal rates of carbon assimilation for much of the day, especially in upper canopy foliage (>10 m). If trees are unable to thermally acclimate to projected elevated temperatures, these forests may shift from net carbon sinks to sources, with potentially dire implications to climate feedbacks and forest community composition.

AB Cultivating microalgae has the potential to produce biofuels and bioproducts from solar energy with low land use and without competing with food crops. However, despite these key advantages, barriers remain to widespread, economical production from microalgae including: the relatively low solar energy conversion efficiency of photosynthesis, unknown optimal cultivation conditions, and the high energy and economic costs of cultivation and processing microalgal biomass. Thus, recent technological developments seek to address these barriers. To optimize cultivation conditions, devices taking advantage of advanced fluid and light handling techniques are being developed. These approaches drastically increase experimental throughput to find the ideal cultivation parameters. To apply optimal conditions, a range of cultivation approaches are being developed to deliver light and nutrients to microalgae to achieve high productivities. Finally, to extract maximal value out of microalgal biomass, downstream processing technology, such as hydrothermal liquefaction, is replacing costly conventional processes to produce fuels and high-value products from microalgae. Taken together, these technologies can allow microalgae to become competitive in the sustainable energy landscape particularly to produce complex, high-value molecules.

AB The relationships between biodiversity and aboveground biomass in forest ecosystems have been intensively studied in recent decades. Still, the mechanisms that underlie it remain highly debated. We hypothesized that overstorey species diversity and individual tree size variation contribute to aboveground biomass and understorey species diversity through the niche complementarity effect, while weaken the relationship between understorey aboveground biomass and individual tree size variation due to the mixed effects of tree development, biotic interaction and reduced available resources by over storey strata. The integrative relationships of species diversity and tree size variation (variation in diameter at breast height-DBH) with aboveground biomass were analysed at overstorey and understorey strata across 125 plots in a 5-ha subtropical forest in Eastern China. For comparison, we tested these relationships at individual strata (isolation modelling), and whole-community level, by using linear structural equation model while accounting for the effects of soil nutrients. The integrative modelling accounted for 35, 31, 16, 12, 4, and 0% of the variation in understorey aboveground biomass, overstorey aboveground biomass, overstorey DBH variation, overstorey species diversity, understorey species diversity, and understorey DBH variation, respectively. Overstorey DBH variation and species diversity had the positive direct effects on overstorey aboveground biomass. Overstorey species diversity significantly promoted the understorey species diversity, but DBH variation and aboveground biomass of overstorey strata had negligible effects on the diversity and aboveground biomass of understorey strata. Soil nutrients had positive direct effect on overstorey DBH variation, but negative direct effects on overstorey and understorey aboveground biomass and overstorey species diversity. These results provide strong evidence for the niche complementarity effect for driving positive relationships of species diversity and individual tree size variation with aboveground biomass at overstorey strata. The strong and consistent negative effects of soil nutrients on overstorey aboveground biomass and species diversity suggest an important mechanism that high species diversity of overstorey strata with great tree size variation on nutrient-poor soils is crucial for driving high aboveground biomass in subtropical forest ecosystems. In conclusion, this study suggests that no sole and ubiquitous relationship between biodiversity and aboveground biomass exists in a structurally complex forest, but rather that the magnitude and direction of this relationship is greatly dependent on the forest strata where available resources shift substantially. We argue that ecological models for predicting aboveground biomass would be improved by including separate effects of overstorey and understorey diversity. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Changes in soil fertility during pedogenesis affect the quantity and quality of resources entering the belowground subsystem. Climate governs pedogenesis, yet how climate modulates responses of soil food webs to soil ageing remains unexplored because of the paucity of appropriate model systems. We characterised soil food webs along each of four retrogressive soil chronosequences situated across a strong regional climate gradient to show that belowground communities are predominantly shaped by changes in fertility rather than climate. Basal consumers showed hump-shaped responses to soil ageing, which were propagated to higher-order consumers. There was a shift in dominance from bacterial to fungal energy channels with increasing soil age, while the root energy channel was most important in intermediate-aged soils. Our study highlights the over-arching importance of soil fertility in regulating soil food webs, and indicates that belowground food webs will respond more strongly to shifts in soil resources than climate change.

AB 1. Understanding the water-use of plants is timely under increasing drought stress due to climate change. Despite the crucial role of roots in water uptake, relationships between water-use and root traits are seldom considered.
   2. Combining a functional trait-based approach with a water balance model, we tested whether root functional traits are related to spatial and temporal water-use among 12 Mediterranean rangeland species grown in common garden monocultures. Soil water content was monitored for 10 months, and the dynamics of water uptake of each species was modelled at a daily time step. Root functional traits were measured at two soil depths (shallow and deep soil).
   3. Species with fast resource acquisition strategies in shallow soil, i.e. thin roots, maximised water uptake in a short period and consumed large amounts of water during periods of low water availability. Conversely, species with a more conservative root strategy, i.e. coarse roots, took up less water during the peak-growing season, maintained water uptake over a longer period of time and consumed less water during periods of low water availability. Deep root traits are strongly related to species' ability to take up water from deep soil. Deep roots with large diameters and low specific root length improve species' ability to reach water from deep soil. Biomass investment in the deep soil layer was positively related to the amount of water consumed during periods of low water availability.
   4. Our results highlight that root functional traits influence a range of spatial and temporal water-use among Mediterranean rangeland species. They account for the amount of water taken up during dry periods but not during the entire growing season.

AB The origins of agriculture date to about 9000 years, but commercial culture and supplementation of marine populations reach back only a few centuries. Hence, wild populations still play a major role in seafood production. Closed culture, stock restorations, sea ranching and stock enhancements of marine fishes and invertebrates have been implemented with various outcomes. A review of the literature indicates that considerable effort has been directed toward culture technologies to maximize production, but scant attention has been given to genetic risks to wild populations. Genetic risks from stock enhancements can be substantial, because of inattention to brood-stock sizes, and because hybridization between hatchery-reared and wild individuals can lower the fitness or lead to the extinction of a natural population. In many cases, small brood-stock sizes have led to the loss of genetic diversity. In some cases, hatchery-reared individuals appear to have replaced, rather than supplemented, wild populations. Here, we outline a responsible approach to managing genetic resources that includes six steps: (1) assess the costs and benefits of a stock restoration or enhancement, (2) set goals and genetic benchmarks, (3) use appropriate brood stock and limit domestication, (4) design release strategies that maximize the effectiveness of supplementation efforts, (5) track individuals after release and (6) minimize genetic impacts on wild populations. Stock supplementation is often viewed as an immediate solution to a stock decline, but should be undertaken as a last resort because of the high cost of implementation and the substantial ecological and genetic risks to wild populations.

AB The efficiency by which fungi decompose organic matter contributes to the amount of carbon that is retained in biomass vs. lost to the atmosphere as respiration. This carbon use efficiency (CUE) is affected by various abiotic conditions, including temperature and nutrient availability. Theoretically, the physiological costs of interspecific interactions should likewise alter CUE, yet the magnitude of these costs is untested. Here we conduct a microcosm experiment to quantify how interactions among wood-decay basidiomycete fungi alter growth, respiration and CUE across a temperature and nitrogen gradient. We show that species interactions induced consistent declines in CUE, regardless of abiotic conditions. Multispecies communities exhibited reductions in CUE of up to 25% relative to individual CUE, with this biotic effect being greater than the observed variation attributable to abiotic conditions. Our results suggest that the extent to which fungal-mediated carbon fluxes respond to environmental change may be influenced strongly by species interactions.

AB Accelerating climate change is eroding the functioning and stability of ecosystems by weakening the interactions among species that stabilize biological communities against change [1]. A key challenge to forecasting the future of ecosystems centers on how to extrapolate results from short-term, single-species studies to community-level responses that are mediated by key mechanisms such as competition, resource availability (bottom-up control), and predation (top-down control) [2]. We used CO2 vents as potential analogs of ocean acidification combined with in situ experiments to test current predictions of fish biodiversity loss and community change due to elevated CO2 [3] and to elucidate the potential mechanisms that drive such change. We show that high risk-taking behavior and competitive strength, combined with resource enrichment and collapse of predator populations, fostered already common species, enabling them to double their populations under acidified conditions. However, the release of these competitive dominants from predator control led to suppression of less common and subordinate competitors that did not benefit from resource enrichment and reduced predation. As a result, local biodiversity was lost and novel fish community compositions were created under elevated CO2. Our study identifies the species interactions most affected by ocean acidification, revealing potential sources of natural selection. We also reveal how diminished predator abundances can have cascading effects on local species diversity, mediated by complex species interactions. Reduced overfishing of predators could therefore act as a key action to stall diversity loss and ecosystem change in a high-CO2 world.

AB Background and Aims Plant hydraulic traits influence the capacity of species to grow and survive in water-limited environments, but their comparative study at a common site has been limited. The primary aim of this study was to determine whether selective pressures on species originating in drought-prone environments constrain hydraulic traits among related species grown under common conditions.
   Methods Leaf tissue water relations, xylem anatomy, stomatal behaviour and vulnerability to drought-induced embolism were measured on six Eucalyptus species growing in a common garden to determine whether these traits were related to current species climate range and to understand linkages between the traits.
   Key Results Hydraulically weighted xylem vessel diameter, leaf turgor loss point, the water potential at stomatal closure and vulnerability to drought-induced embolism were significantly (P < 0.05) correlated with climate parameters from the species range. There was a co-ordination between stem and leaf parameters with the water potential at turgor loss, 12 % loss of conductivity and the point of stomatal closure significantly correlated.
   Conclusions The correlation of hydraulic, stomatal and anatomical traits with climate variables from the species' original ranges suggests that these traits are genetically constrained. The conservative nature of xylem traits in Eucalyptus trees has important implications for the limits of species responses to changing environmental conditions and thus for species survival and distribution into the future, and yields new information for physiological models.

AB 1. De-extinction, the idea that extinct species might soon be resurrected, receives considerable attention in both popular and scientific literature, in particular with regard to its potential ecological and ethical consequences.
   2. Here, I review the three main pathways that are being considered at present for de-extinction: back-breeding, cloning via somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) and genetic engineering. I present the state of the art in each pathway and discuss the limitations of each approach as a mechanism to resurrect extinct species.
   3. Back-breeding aims to concentrate ancestral traits that persist within a population into a single individual using selective breeding. In back-breeding, ancestral phenotypes may be resurrected after many generations, but the genes that underlie these phenotypes may differ from those that were present in the extinct species.
   4. Cloning aims to create genetically identical copies of an extinct species from preserved somatic cells. These somatic cells are fused with egg cells from a closely related and living donor species, which causes cellular reprogramming and embryogenesis, a scientific process known as SCNT. The developing embryo is then brought to term within a surrogate host. Because biological remains degrade post-mortem, cloning of long-dead organisms is not likely to be feasible.
   5. Genetic engineering aims to edit the genome sequence within cells of living species so that these genome sequences closely resemble that of a closely related extinct species. This approach draws on recent advances in both ancient DNA and genome editing technologies and is a particularly promising approach to de-extinction. After the genome of a living cell is edited, that living cell can then be used for SCNT.
   6. Because the phenotype of an organism is the consequence of the interaction between its genotype and the environment in which it develops and lives, even species with cloned nuclear genomes will not be exact copies of the extinct species on which they are modelled. We should therefore consider de-extinction as a means to create ecological proxies for extinct species.

AB This study develops a spatially varying coefficient model by extending the random effects eigenvector spatial filtering model. The developed model has the following properties: its spatially varying coefficients are defined by a linear combination of the eigenvectors describing the Moran coefficient; each of its coefficients can have a different degree of spatial smoothness; and it yields a variant of a Bayesian spatially varying coefficient model. Moreover, parameter estimation of the model can be executed with a relatively small computational burden. Results of a Monte Carlo simulation reveal that our model outperforms a conventional eigenvector spatial filtering (ESF) model and geographically weighted regression (GWR) models in terms of the accuracy of the coefficient estimates and computational time. We empirically apply our model to the hedonic land price analysis of flood hazards in Japan. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB AimTo investigate the relationships between species attributes and genetic parameters in Australian plant species and to determine the associations in relation to predictions from population theory and previous global analyses.
   LocationContinent of Australia.
   MethodsWe assembled a dataset of all known population genetic analyses of Australian plants based on neutral markers and catalogued them according to key species attributes, including range, abundance, range disjunction, biome and growth form; and genetic parameters, mean number of alleles per locus, observed and expected heterozygosity and population differentiation. We determined relationships between species attributes and genetic parameters using a maximum-likelihood, multimodel inference approach.
   ResultsWe found many associations that were consistent with predictions. Species attributes with greatest effect on genetic diversity were range size, growth form, abundance and biome. The most important attributes influencing genetic differentiation were range disjunction and abundance. We found unexpected results in the effects of biome and growth form on genetic diversity, with greater diversity in the eastern biome of Australia, and lower diversity in shrubs compared to trees.
   Main conclusionsOur analysis of genetic diversity of Australian plants showed associations consistent with predictions based on population genetics theory, with strong effects of range size, abundance and growth form. We identified a striking effect of range disjunction on population genetic differentiation, an effect that has received little attention in the literature. We also found some notable differences to global predictions, which were most likely explained by confounding effects across variables. This highlights that caution is needed when extrapolating trends from global analyses to regional floras. Identifying associations between species attributes and patterns of genetic diversity enables broadscale predictions to facilitate the inclusion of genetic considerations into conservation decision-making.

AB Many exotic species have little apparent impact on ecosystem processes, whereas others have dramatic consequences for human and ecosystem health. There is growing evidence that invasions foster eutrophication. We need to identify species that are harmful and systems that are vulnerable to anticipate these consequences. Species' traits may provide the necessary insights.
   We conducted a global meta-analysis to determine whether plant leaf and litter functional traits, and particularly leaf and litter nitrogen (N) content and carbon: nitrogen (C : N) ratio, explain variation in invasive species' impacts on soil N cycling.
   Dissimilarity in leaf and litter traits among invaded and noninvaded plant communities control the magnitude and direction of invasion impacts on N cycling. Invasions that caused the greatest increases in soil inorganic N and mineralization rates had a much greater litter N content and lower litter C : N in the invaded than the reference community. Trait dissimilarities were better predictors than the trait values of invasive species alone.
   Quantifying baseline community tissue traits, in addition to those of the invasive species, is critical to understanding the impacts of invasion on soil N cycling.

AB Adaptive learning about nature, based on observations and continual rethinking, dates back to Native Americans in what we call Traditional Ecological Knowledge. Fast forward to 1950+, when Eugene, Howard, and William Odum promoted sound science and its use in managing ecosystems-called adaptive management (AM). What began as an instinctive way of thinking and deciding how to obtain resources using accumulated information became a structured, science-based process that improves over time, given continual critiques of projects, clarification of definitions, and analyses of outcomes. The basic need is still to sustain ecosystem services despite uncertainties, such as climate change. I report recent innovations in the AM of estuaries and coasts that can add knowledge and improve future efforts. Innovations include new guidelines and approaches to confront uncertainty, engage stakeholders, improve governance, prioritize actions, centralize the role of science, and manage holistically. AM has been effective along the coast of Denmark and in several estuaries, and it is evolving elsewhere. In The Netherlands, Spain, California, and Oregon, large field experiments are generating "learning while restoring" (adaptive restoration, AR). AM and AR can help managers of coastal ecosystems and watersheds mitigate the impacts of rising sea levels, sea storms, and human disturbances. Science-based decision-making will become more nimble and protection/restoration more effective as innovations and model approaches are tailored to individual estuaries and coasts.

AB Bacterial communities of rhizospheric soils play an important role in the tolerance and uptake of metal-tolerant/hyperaccumulating plants to metals, e.g. the Cu-tolerant Elsholtzia splendens native to China. In this work, pyrosequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene was firstly applied to investigate the rhizospheric bacterial community of E. splendens grown at Cu contaminated sites. The 47 phyla including 11 dominant phyla (>1%) in E. splendens rhizosphere were presented. The effects of Cu and other environmental factors (total organic carbon, total nitrogen and pH) on the rhizospheric bacterial community were studied comprehensively. The phyla abundances were affected by the environmental factors to different extent, and we found pH, instead of Cu concentration, influenced UniFrac distance significantly and was identified as the most important environmental factor affecting bacterial community. In addition, the influence of environmental factors on gene profiles was explored according to the predicted metagenomes obtained by PICRUSt (phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states). Our study illustrates a view about Cu-tolerant E. splendens rhizospheric bacterial communities (composition, diversity and gene profiles) and their influencing factors, giving a hand for the understanding on bacterial community is formed and affected in rhizosphere.

AB The next advance in field crop productivity will likely need to come from improving crop use efficiency of resources (e.g., light, water, and nitrogen), aspects of which are closely linked with overall crop photosynthetic efficiency. Progress in genetic manipulation of photosynthesis is confounded by uncertainties of consequences at crop level because of difficulties connecting across scales. Crop growth and development simulation models that integrate across biological levels of organization and use a gene-to-phenotype modeling approach may present a way forward. There has been a long history of development of crop models capable of simulating dynamics of crop physiological attributes. Many crop models incorporate canopy photosynthesis (source) as a key driver for crop growth, while others derive crop growth from the balance between source- and sink-limitations. Modeling leaf photosynthesis has progressed from empirical modeling via light response curves to a more mechanistic basis, having clearer links to the underlying biochemical processes of photosynthesis. Cross-scale modeling that connects models at the biochemical and crop levels and utilizes developments in upscaling leaf-level models to canopy models has the potential to bridge the gap between photosynthetic manipulation at the biochemical level and its consequences on crop productivity. Here we review approaches to this emerging cross-scale modeling framework and reinforce the need for connections across levels of modeling. Further, we propose strategies for connecting biochemical models of photosynthesis into the cross-scale modeling framework to support crop improvement through photosynthetic manipulation.

AB The extinction vortex is a theoretical model describing the process by which extinction risk is elevated in small, isolated populations owing to interactions between environmental, demographic, and genetic factors. However, empirical demonstrations of these interactions have been elusive. We modelled the dynamics of a small mountain lion population isolated by anthropogenic barriers in greater Los Angeles, California, to evaluate the influence of demographic, genetic, and landscape factors on extinction probability. The population exhibited strong survival and reproduction, and the model predicted stable median population growth and a 15% probability of extinction over 50 years in the absence of inbreeding depression. However, our model also predicted the population will lose 40-57% of its heterozygosity in 50 years. When we reduced demographic parameters proportional to reductions documented in another wild population of mountain lions that experienced inbreeding depression, extinction probability rose to 99.7%. Simulating greater landscape connectivity by increasing immigration to greater than or equal to one migrant per generation appears sufficient to largely maintain genetic diversity and reduce extinction probability. We provide empirical support for the central tenet of the extinction vortex as interactions between genetics and demography greatly increased extinction probability relative to the risk from demographic and environmental stochasticity alone. Our modelling approach realistically integrates demographic and genetic data to provide a comprehensive assessment of factors threatening small populations.

AB Even in some of the best-studied areas, there has been little direct evaluation of how extensively mangroves are used by fish, or the extent of their penetration through mangrove forests. As a result, paradigms about the utilisation and value of mangroves have not been fully tested. We used an array of unbaited underwater videos to investigate the extent to which fish used mangroves in north-eastern Australian estuaries. Only a small subset of estuarine species were observed entering the mangroves, and patterns of utilisation differed from those expected based on standard paradigms. In particular, trophic groups such as planktivores occurred rarely even 1 m inside the seaward mangrove margin, with utilisation dominated by a few species known to specialise on mangrove-associated prey. Of the species that did enter the mangroves, only a few penetrated through to the landward edge. The limited use of mangroves by fish in these systems suggests a need to reconsider the ways in which mangroves provide refuge and the extent to which they are used as foraging sites. The fact that mangrove use was more restricted than expected implies that the nursery value of these systems is likely to be conferred at a whole-ecosystem scale, and emphasises the need for a detailed, region-specific understanding of the specific values of the different components of mangrove ecosystems.

AB Comparative studies on plant species have not distinguished between two inherently different applications of the idea of a trade-off. In the first case, the theoretical trade-off between two variables leads to a trend line, about which there is a degree of scatter. Any two species in the study are expected, in theory, to show a true trade-off, i.e. feature A must decrease for feature B to increase. This I call the 'trend line' type of plot. In the second case, the species are expected to fill a considerable part of the space defined by two axes and the theoretical trade-off leads to a boundary line which limits the extent of the cloud of points. In this case, many interspecific comparisons are not expected to show evidence of a trade-off, but those on the boundary line are expected to do so. This I call the 'boundary line' type of plot. In both types of plot, species within a given clade may show a true trade-off, while large numbers of unrelated species do not.
   First, I undertake to show, by means of examples, the reality of the distinction made above, and to demonstrate that statistically significant and ecologically important negative correlations between features A and B in the 'trend line' type of plot can be accompanied by huge variation from the trend line. Second, for plots of the 'boundary line' type, I undertake to show that authors have not always tested sufficiently rigorously the constraint lines concerning combinations of supposedly incompatible tolerances, and have not allowed for the absence of certain combinations of unfavourable conditions in the field and consequent lack of selection pressure for the evolution of species with a combination of extreme tolerances.
   I review two examples of each kind of constrained evolution. First, I take the worldwide leaf economics spectrum and the negative correlation between growth rate in high light and survival rate in deep shade. Second, I review the supposed incompatibilities between shade tolerance and drought tolerance, and between waterlogging tolerance and drought tolerance.
   I conclude that the term 'trade-off' is used too loosely. The common lack of true trade-offs has made possible the species richness of present-day vegetation. Also, small numbers of species have evolved combinations of tolerances that might seem improbable. Not enough research is being aimed at understanding the mechanistic basis of variation about trend lines, and the crossing of supposed boundary lines.

AB In seasonal plant communities where water availability changes dramatically both between and within seasons, understanding the mechanisms that enable plants to exploit water pulses and to survive drought periods is crucial. By measuring rates of physiological processes, we examined the trade-off between water exploitation and drought tolerance among seedlings of trees of a tropical dry forest, and identified biophysical traits most closely associated with plant water-use strategies. We also explored whether early and late secondary successional species occupy different portions of trade-off axes. As predicted, species that maintained carbon capture, hydraulic function and leaf area at higher plant water deficits during drought had low photosynthetic rates, xylem hydraulic conductivity and growth rate under non-limiting water supply. Drought tolerance was associated with more dense leaf, stem and root tissues, whereas rapid resource acquisition was associated with greater stem water storage, larger vessel diameter and larger leaf area per mass invested. We offer evidence that the water exploitation versus drought tolerance trade-off drives species differentiation in the ability of tropical dry forest trees to deal with alternating water-drought pulses. However, we detected no evidence of strong functional differentiation between early and late successional species along the proposed trade-off axes, suggesting that the environmental gradient of water availability across secondary successional habitats in the dry tropics does not filter out physiological strategies of water use among species, at least at the seedling stage.

AB Plant population density (PPD) is an important practice for optimizing canopy structure and improving canopy photosynthetic capacity of field-grown cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.). A 2-yr field experiment was conducted to determine if and how PPD (7.5, 19.5 or 31.5 plants m(-2)) affects the light-saturated photosynthetic rate and photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency in cotton leaves, with a focus on the key canopy characteristics for efficient utilization of light and nitrogen. The results showed that leaf N allocation and partitioning among different components of the photosynthetic apparatus were significantly affected by PPD. As PPD changed, cotton optimized photosynthetic N use efficiency and photosynthetic capacity by adjusting leaf mass per area, which in turn affected leaf N allocation to the photosynthetic apparatus. In the upper canopy layer, leaf N allocation to the photosynthetic apparatus increased as PPD increased, resulting in an increase in leaf photosynthetic N use efficiency. In contrast, in the mid-and lower-canopy layers, leaf N allocation to the photosynthetic apparatus decreased as PPD increased, resulting in declines in leaf light-saturated photosynthetic rate and photosynthetic N use efficiency. The overall results indicated that high photosynthetic capacity of leaves in the upper-canopy layer and high leaf N allocation to the photosynthetic apparatus and photosynthetic use efficiency of photosynthetic nitrogen in the mid- and lower-canopy layers were two key canopy characteristics for efficient utilization of light and nitrogen by cotton. The medium-PPD is the optimum plant density due to high light utilization efficiency, superior spatial distribution of leaf N allocation to the photosynthetic apparatus and photosynthetic use efficiency of photosynthetic N in leaves within the canopy.

AB Plant-herbivore interactions occur in all ecosystems and provide a major avenue for energy flow to higher trophic levels. A long-standing hypothesis to explain the latitudinal gradient in species diversity proposes that the relatively stable and frost-free climate of the tropics should lead to more intense biotic interactions in tropical compared with temperate environments, giving rise to a greater diversity of plants and herbivores. Herbivory rates have been compared across latitudes to test this biotic interactions hypothesis, with herbivory typically being measured from observable leaf damage. However, we argue that a measure of percentage leaf damage alone does not straightforwardly reflect the cost of herbivory to the plant, and on its own does not constitute an appropriate test of the biotic interactions hypothesis. For a given amount of herbivory, the impact of herbivory is dependent upon many factors, such as the construction cost of the leaf, the growth and replacement rates and leaf life span. We investigate the latitudinal gradient in herbivory by analysing a large dataset of herbivory rates for 452 tree species and separating the species into those with short and long leaf life spans. We show that annual herbivory rates tend to be greater at lower latitudes for evergreen species (which have long-lived leaves), but no trend in herbivory rate with latitude was found for species with short leaf life spans. Phylogenetic least squares regression assuming Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes also showed a negative effect of latitude on herbivory rate for evergreen trees, but we caution that viewing herbivory as a species trait is problematic. An integrative approach that incorporates leaf life span, as well as the costs of investment in growth and potential costs of losing leaf tissue, is needed to further our understanding of the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of herbivory.

AB 1. Freshwater assessment studies have been used changes on individuals and populations of Chironomidae assemblages as bioindicators to assay aquatic ecosystems changes and environmental quality. To assess the contribution of the studies with this family to response aquatic environmental changes, we carried out a scientometric analysis of the papers published from 1992 to 2012.
   2. We imported papers from ISI Web of Knowledge database (Thomson Reuters) in November 2013. A total of 2967 papers were evaluated and we carried out descriptive analysis to assay the main trends on Chironomidae research in freshwater assessments.
   3. The main ideas and approaches in these studies were related to the impact of human influence on aquatic ecosystems and the status of conservation of this environments, as well as to limitations and difficulties in the applications of the assessments.
   4. In view of our results, we suggest some ideas to contribute to the conservation of aquatic ecosystems, mainly in threatened environments in southern Hemisphere countries. However, Chironomidae identification for assessing aquatic environments, as well as the limitations of suitable tools and metrics, which still are strong issues that need more attention to make more robust approaches to assay aquatic ecosystems.

AB Aim Resource bottlenecks - periods of severe restriction in resource availability - triggered by increased climate variability represent important and little-understood mechanisms through which climate change will affect biodiversity. In this review, we aim to synthesize the key global change processes that exacerbate the severity of bottlenecks in resource availability on animal populations, and outline how adaptation responses can help buffer the impacts.
   Location Global.
   Methods We collate examples from the literature of population-level impacts of resource bottlenecks induced by extreme weather and climate events to explore the types of population impacts that have most frequently been recorded, and the type of extreme events associated with them. We then develop a conceptual framework that captures the factors contributing to species' vulnerability to climate-induced spatial and temporal resource bottlenecks in increasingly variable environments.
   Results Increases in the frequency, severity and/or duration of extreme weather and climate events can trigger resource bottlenecks that act as powerful demographic constraints on terrestrial fauna, and often exacerbate other human-induced pressures such as land use change. Such phenomena are likely to become more frequent and severe, with potentially nonlinear increases in impact. Forty-nine instances of population-level impacts from climate-induced resource bottlenecks were recorded from the literature, including four extinctions and ten population crashes. Anthropogenic land use change interacts with increasing climatic variability to exacerbate these resource 'crunches', but can sometimes act as a buffer for species.
   Main Conclusions Resource bottlenecks are likely to be a large class of climate-sensitive stressors whose impacts may play out at the population scale, even well within a species' apparent climatic envelope. More effective conservation responses to climate-related threats include explicit actions, such as managing protected area networks for spatial and temporal resource complementarities, that buffer vulnerable species against bottlenecks.

AB The abundance of low-density species like carnivores is logistically difficult to directly estimate at a meaningful scale. Predictive distribution models are often used as a surrogate for density estimation. But because density can continue to increase as occupancy asymptotes at 1, occupancy may have little value as an index, and home range expansion in marginal habitat may further confound the association. We sought to estimate bobcat population size at a landscape scale (14,286km(2)) in central Wisconsin, which provided an opportunity to relate predicted occurrence to individual space use and population density. We sampled bobcats using motion-sensitive trail cameras at 9 arrays across central Wisconsin. We estimated bobcat site-specific occupancy, and regressed these estimates as linear or asymptotic functions of site-specific density to determine the strength and shape of their association. We subsequently modeled both parameters relative to habitat covariates and repeated the regression process. A linear functional relationship between density and occupancy was most supported when detection parameters were held constant (w(i)=0.97, R-2=0.72) and when detection, occurrence, and density were modeled as a function of habitat covariates (w(i)=0.99, R-2=0.95). This suggests that repeated presence-absence data alone may be an efficient and reliable method for inferring spatial patterns in bobcat density or identifying habitat types with greater density potential in the northern parts of its range. Bobcat occupancy and density were both positively associated with surrounding woody cover and wetland edge density. Our most supported spatially explicit capture-recapture model estimated bobcat abundance as 362 adult individuals (95% CI 272-490) across the study area. (c) 2015 The Wildlife Society.

AB Extensive studies have been conducted to evaluate the effect of soil fauna on plant litter decomposition in terrestrial ecosystems. However, scholars have reported inconsistent results on the direction and magnitude of the soil fauna effect. We present a global synthesis of 75 papers that cover 197 plant species with 543 cases of plant litter decomposition experiments and soil fauna effects on plant litter decomposition. By using a boosted regression tree model (BRT), we aim to provide a synthesis of existing data that comprehensively and quantitatively evaluates how climate, plant litter quality, and study methods interact with soil fauna in affecting plant litter decomposition. Global average effect size (ES) is -0.426, which indicates a 35% lower decomposition rate when soil fauna is excluded by physical or chemical exclusion techniques. The final model explains 32.3% of the variation in ES. The predictors that substantially account for the explained variation include mean annual temperature (MAT, 37.1%), mean annual precipitation (MAP, 9.7%), phosphorus (12.4%), nitrogen (5.6%), and lignin content (5.5%). By contrast, the heterogeneity of the study duration and soil fauna exclusion technique have negligible contributions (each <5%). Log effect size strongly decreases with both MAT and MAP. Plant litters with high quality have stronger soil fauna effect because the log effect size is negatively related to nitrogen and phosphorus content and positively related to lignin content. Our analysis demonstrates the critical role of climate and plant litter quality in determining the soil fauna effect on plant litter decomposition in terrestrial ecosystems. However, the large unexplained variation (67.7%) in ES in the BRT model indicates undiscovered mechanisms underlying the soil fauna effect in our analysis. We call for further studies on this topic in the future. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Forest fragmentation and habitat loss are among the major current extinction causes. Remaining fragments are mostly small, isolated and showing poor quality. Being primarily arboreal, Neotropical primates are generally sensitive to fragmentation effects. Furthermore, primates are involved in complex ecological process. Thus, landscape changes that negatively interfere with primate population dynamic affect the structure, composition, and ultimately the viability of the whole community. We evaluated if fragment size, isolation and visibility and matrix permeability are important for explaining the occurrence of three Neotropical primate species. Employing playback, we verified the presence of Callicebus nigrifrons, Callithrix aurita and Sapajus nigritus at 45 forest fragments around the municipality of Alfenas, Brazil. We classified the landscape and evaluated the metrics through predictive models of occurrence. We selected the best models through Akaike Selection Criterion. Aiming at validating our results, we applied the plausible models to another region (20 fragments at the neighboring municipality of Poco Fundo, Brazil). Twelve models were plausible, and three were validated, two for Sapajus nigritus (Area and Area+Visibility) and one for Callicebus nigrifrons (Area+Matrix). Our results reinforce the contribution of fragment size to maintain biodiversity within highly degraded habitats. At the same time, they stress the importance of including novel, biologically relevant metrics in landscape studies, such as visibility and matrix permeability, which can provide invaluable help for similar studies in the future and on conservation practices in the long run.

AB Simulations of carbon fluxes with terrestrial biosphere models still exhibit significant uncertainties, in part due to the uncertainty in model parameter values. With the advent of satellite measurements of solar induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF), there exists a novel pathway for constraining simulated carbon fluxes and parameter values. We investigate the utility of SIF in constraining gross primary productivity (GPP). As a first test we assess whether SIF simulations are sensitive to important parameters in a biosphere model. SIF measurements at the wavelength of 755 nm are simulated by the Carbon-Cycle Data Assimilation System (CCDAS) which has been augmented by the fluorescence component of the Soil Canopy Observation, Photochemistry and Energy fluxes (SCOPE) model.
   Idealized sensitivity tests of the SCOPE model stand-alone indicate strong sensitivity of GPP to the carboxylation capacity (V-cmax) and of SIF to the chlorophyll AB content (C-ab) and incoming short wave radiation. Low sensitivity is found for SIF to V-cmax, however the relationship is subtle, with increased sensitivity under high radiation conditions and lower V-cmax ranges.
   CCDAS simulates well the patterns of satellite-measured SIF suggesting the combined model is capable of ingesting the data. CCDAS supports the idealized sensitivity tests of SCOPE, with SIF exhibiting sensitivity to C-ab and incoming radiation, both of which are treated as perfectly known in previous CCDAS versions. These results demonstrate the need for careful consideration of C-ab and incoming radiation when interpreting SIF and the limitations of utilizing SIF to constrain V-cmax in the present set-up in the CCDAS system.

AB Road networks, even in industrialized countries, become denser year after year and traffic volumes continue to increase at a steady pace. It is imperative that we monitor the impact of this trend on wildlife, but monitoring roads for flattened fauna is a time consuming effort and roadkill monitoring projects conducted up till now have been relatively small scale both in terms of time and space. This hampers the progress of road ecology analyses at the population level and at larger landscape extents.
   We demonstrate that citizen science projects in combination with smartphones and other new technologies allow analysis at this level and extent, and simultaneously offer more complete data for safer transportation and mitigation of roadkill hotspots. Monitoring roadkill with citizen scientists poses certain challenges regarding data quality and people management, but we show that these challenges can be addressed, which allows researchers to benefit from the many other advantages and possible applications of monitoring roadkill with citizen scientists, including raising public awareness on the matter.

AB Understanding the at-sea spatial behaviour of sea turtles is a priority for their conservation. In the present paper, the current information on the distribution and movement patterns of the two species breeding in the Mediterranean, the loggerhead and the green turtle, is reviewed, focusing mainly on the 195 published routes of satellite-tracked turtles. A satisfactory level of knowledge about adults' migrations and other movements is reached only for loggerheads breeding at Zakynthos Island, Greece, and for green and loggerhead females nesting in Cyprus, while studies at foraging grounds are limited to loggerheads in the western and central parts of the basin. Adult males and females mostly show quite uniform post-breeding migratory patterns, typically moving towards individually specific neritic foraging grounds. A much higher variability is shown by loggerhead juveniles, which is probably associated with differences in their spatial behaviour while in oceanic or neritic waters. Evidence of seasonal migrations driven by lower temperatures in winter is available only for adult and juvenile loggerheads frequenting the two northernmost parts of the basin, i.e. the Ligurian and the northern Adriatic Sea. Current knowledge gaps and priorities for further research in the Mediterranean are discussed.

AB The "land sharing versus land sparing" concept provides a framework for comparing potential land use patterns in terms of trade-offs between biodiversity conservation and agricultural yields at a landscape scale. Here, we raise two additional aspects to be considered in the sparing/sharing debate, supported by a review of available literature. First, beta and gamma (instead of alpha) diversity measures capture landscape scale variance in biodiversity in response to land use changes and should be considered for the long-term management of agricultural landscapes. Moreover, beta and gamma diversity may better account for comparisons of biodiversity between spared and shared land use options. Second, land use history has a pronounced influence on the complexity and variance in agricultural habitat niches at a landscape scale, which in turn may determine the relevance of sparing or sharing land use options. Appropriate and comparable biodiversity metrics and the recognition of landscape history are two vital preconditions in aligning biological conservation goals with maximized yields within the sparing/sharing framework.

AB MultiLocus Variable number of tandem repeat Analysis (MLVA) has been extensively used to examine epidemiological and evolutionary issues on monomorphic human pathogenic bacteria, but not on bacterial plant pathogens of agricultural importance albeit such tools would improve our understanding of their epidemiology, as well as of the history of epidemics on a global scale. Xanthomonas citri pv. citri is a quarantine organism in several countries and a major threat for the citrus industry worldwide. We screened the genomes of Xanthomonas citri pv. citri strain IAPAR 306 and of phylogenetically related xanthomonads for tandem repeats. From these in silico data, an optimized MLVA scheme was developed to assess the global diversity of this monomorphic bacterium. Thirty-one minisatellite loci (MLVA-31) were selected to assess the genetic structure of 129 strains representative of the worldwide pathological and genetic diversity of X. citri pv. citri. Based on Discriminant Analysis of Principal Components (DAPC), four pathotype-specific clusters were defined. DAPC cluster 1 comprised strains that were implicated in the major geographical expansion of X. citri pv. citri during the 20th century. A subset of 12 loci (MLVA-12) resolved 89% of the total diversity and matched the genetic structure revealed by MLVA-31. MLVA-12 is proposed for routine epidemiological identification of X. citri pv. citri, whereas MLVA-31 is proposed for phylogenetic and population genetics studies. MLVA-31 represents an opportunity for international X. citri pv. citri genotyping and data sharing. The MLVA-31 data generated in this study was deposited in the Xanthomonas citri genotyping database (http://www.biopred.net/MLVA/).

AB Increased commercial importance of spiny dogfish (Squalus acanthias) combined with an often debated, and controversial, ecological impact has warranted an investigation of the relationship among distribution, environment, and prey to better understand the species ecology and inform management. To elucidate mechanisms behind distributional changes, we modeled seasonal occurrence and abundance of neonate, immature, and mature spiny dogfish as functions of abiotic and biotic factors using generalized additive models and Northeast Fisheries Science Center bottom trawl survey data. Significant nonlinear relationships were widespread throughout dogfish stages and seasons. Seasonal occurrence was tightly linked to depth and bottom temperature, with year and Julian day influential for some stages. While these factors also influenced abundance, ecological factors (e. g., squid abundances) significantly contributed to trends for many stages. Potential impacts of climate change were evaluated by forecasting distributions under different temperature scenarios, which revealed higher regional probabilities of occurrence for most stages during a warmer than average year. Our results can be used to better understand the relationship between sampling periods and movement drivers to survey catchability of the population in the Northeast (US) shelf large marine ecosystem.

AB Background: Understanding the demographic history of a population is critical to conservation and to our broader understanding of evolutionary processes. For many tropical large mammals, however, this aim is confounded by the absence of fossil material and by the misleading signal obtained from genetic data of recently fragmented and isolated populations. This is particularly true for the lion which as a consequence of millennia of human persecution, has large gaps in its natural distribution and several recently extinct populations.
   Results: We sequenced mitochondrial DNA from museum-preserved individuals, including the extinct Barbary lion (Panthera leo leo) and Iranian lion (P. l. persica), as well as lions from West and Central Africa. We added these to a broader sample of lion sequences, resulting in a data set spanning the historical range of lions. Our Bayesian phylogeographical analyses provide evidence for highly supported, reciprocally monophyletic lion clades. Using a molecular clock, we estimated that recent lion lineages began to diverge in the Late Pleistocene. Expanding equatorial rainforest probably separated lions in South and East Africa from other populations. West African lions then expanded into Central Africa during periods of rainforest contraction. Lastly, we found evidence of two separate incursions into Asia from North Africa, first into India and later into the Middle East.
   Conclusions: We have identified deep, well-supported splits within the mitochondrial phylogeny of African lions, arguing for recognition of some regional populations as worthy of independent conservation. More morphological and nuclear DNA data are now needed to test these subdivisions.

AB Molecular evolutionary rate heterogeneity-the violation of a molecular clock-is a prominent feature of many phylogenetic data sets. It has particular importance to systematists not only because of its biological implications, but also for its practical effects on our ability to infer and date evolutionary events. Here we show, using both maximum likelihood and Bayesian approaches, that a remarkably strong increase in substitution rate in the vittarioid ferns is consistent across the nuclear and plastid genomes. Contrary to some expectations, this rate increase is not due to selective forces acting at the protein level on our focal loci. The vittarioids bear no signature of the change in the relative strengths of selection and drift that one would expect if the rate increase was caused by altered post-mutation fixation rates. Instead, the substitution rate increase appears to stem from an elevated supply of mutations, perhaps limited to the vittarioid ancestral branch. This generalized rate increase is accompanied by extensive fine-scale heterogeneity in rates across loci, genomes, and taxa. Our analyses demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of trait-free investigations of rate heterogeneity within a model-selection framework, emphasize the importance of explicit tests for signatures of selection prior to invoking selection-related or demography-based explanations for patterns of rate variation, and illustrate some unexpected nuances in the behavior of relaxed clock methods for modeling rate heterogeneity, with implications for our ability to confidently date divergence events. In addition, our data provide strong support for the monophyly of Adiantum, and for the position of Calciphilopteris in the cheilanthoid ferns, two relationships for which convincing support was previously lacking.

   DESICCATION; CARBON; RECOLONIZATION; BREITENBACH
AB Droughts are among the most important disturbance events for stream ecosystems; they not only affect stream hydrology but also the stream biota. Although desiccation of streams is common in Mediterranean regions, phases of dryness in headwaters have been observed more often and for longer periods in extended temperate regions, including Central Europe, reflecting global climate change and enhanced water withdrawal. The effects of desiccation and rewetting on the bacterial community composition and extracellular enzyme activity, a key process in the carbon flow of streams and rivers, were investigated in a typical Central European stream, the Breitenbach (Hesse, Germany). Wet streambed sediment is an important habitat in streams. It was sampled and exposed in the laboratory to different drying scenarios (fast, intermediate, slow) for 13 weeks, followed by rewetting of the sediment from the fast drying scenario via a sediment core perfusion technique for 2 weeks. Bacterial community structure was analyzed using CARD-FISH and TGGE, and extracellular enzyme activity was assessed using fluorogenic model substrates. During desiccation the bacterial community composition shifted toward composition in soil, exhibiting increasing proportions of Actinobacteria and Alphaproteobacteria and decreasing proportions of Bacteroidetes and Betaproteobacteria. Simultaneously the activities of extracellular enzymes decreased, most pronounced with aminopeptidases and less pronounced with enzymes involved in the degradation of polymeric carbohydrates. After rewetting, the general ecosystem functioning, with respect to extracellular enzyme activity, recovered after 10 to 14 days. However, the bacterial community composition had not yet achieved its original composition as in unaffected sediments within this time. Thus, whether the bacterial community eventually recovers completely after these events remains unknown. Perhaps this community undergoes permanent changes, especially after harsh desiccation, followed by loss of the specialized functions of specific groups of bacteria.

TI Relative Effects of Road Risk, Habitat Suitability, and Connectivity on
   Wildlife Roadkills: The Case of Tawny Owls (Strix aluco)
SO PLOS ONE

AB Background: Despite its importance for reducing wildlife-vehicle collisions, there is still incomplete understanding of factors responsible for high road mortality. In particular, few empirical studies examined the idea that spatial variation in roadkills is influenced by a complex interplay between road-related factors, and species-specific habitat quality and landscape connectivity.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: In this study we addressed this issue, using a 7-year dataset of tawny owl (Strix aluco) roadkills recorded along 37 km of road in southern Portugal. We used a multi-species roadkill index as a surrogate of intrinsic road risk, and we used a Maxent distribution model to estimate habitat suitability. Landscape connectivity was estimated from least-cost paths between tawny owl territories, using habitat suitability as a resistance surface. We defined 10 alternative scenarios to compute connectivity, based on variation in potential movement patterns according to territory quality and dispersal distance thresholds. Hierarchical partitioning of a regression model indicated that independent variation in tawny owl roadkills was explained primarily by the roadkill index (70.5%) and, to a much lesser extent, by landscape connectivity (26.2%), while habitat suitability had minor effects (3.3%). Analysis of connectivity scenarios suggested that owl roadkills were primarily related to short range movements (<5 km) between high quality territories. Tawny owl roadkills were spatially autocorrelated, but the introduction of spatial filters in the regression model did not change the type and relative contribution of environmental variables.
   Conclusions: Overall, results suggest that road-related factors may have a dominant influence on roadkill patterns, particularly in areas like ours where habitat quality and landscape connectivity are globally high for the study species. Nevertheless, the study supported the view that functional connectivity should be incorporated whenever possible in roadkill models, as it may greatly increase their power to predict the location of roadkill hotspots.

AB Microbial decomposition of soil organic matter (SOM) is the source of most of the terrestrial carbon dioxide emission. Consequently, our ability to predict how climate warming will affect the global carbon (C) budget relies on our understanding of the temperature relationship and adaptability of microbial processes. We exposed soil microcosms to temperatures between 0 and 54 degrees C for 2 months. After this, bacterial growth (leucine incorporation) and functioning (C-14-glucose mineralisation) were estimated at 8 temperatures in the interval 0-54 degrees C to determine temperature relationships and apparent minimum (T-min) and optimum (T-opt) temperatures for growth and mineralisation. We predicted that incubation at temperatures above the initial T-opt for bacteria would select for a warm-adapted community, i.e. a positive shift in T-min and T-opt for bacterial growth, and that this adaptation of the bacterial community would coincide with a similar shift also for their functioning. As anticipated, we found that exposure to temperatures below T-opt did not change the temperature relationship of bacterial growth or mineralisation. Interestingly, T-opt for glucose mineralisation was >20 degrees C higher than that for growth. For bacterial growth, the temperature relationship for the bacterial community was modulated when soils were incubated at temperature above their initial T-opt (approximate to 30 degrees C). This was shown by an increase in T-min of 0.8 degrees C for every 1 degrees C increase in soil temperature, evidencing a shift towards warm-adapted bacteria. Similarly, the Q-10 (15-25 degrees C) for bacterial growth increased at temperature higher than T-opt. We could not detect a corresponding temperature adaptation of the decomposer functioning. We discuss possible underlying reasons for the temperature-responses of bacterial processes. We note that a temperature adaptation will be rapid when exceeding the T-opt, which initially were >20 degrees C higher for glucose mineralisation than growth. This difference could suggest that different responses to warming exposure should be expected for these microbial processes. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Vulnerability assessment (VA) is increasingly developed and utilized in various sectors and fields of society. VA provides a better understanding of the interactions among system, pressures, and threats, which serves as a basis for targeted adaptation strategies. The framework or tool named tool for understanding resilience of fisheries (VA-TURF) was developed to assess the vulnerability of the coastal fisheries ecosystems in the tropics to climate change. VA-TURF has three major components, namely, fisheries, reef ecosystem, and socio-economics. Although each component has intrinsic properties, the three components are strongly interrelated. Indicators associated to sensitivity, exposure, and adaptive capacity were developed for each component of TURF. The exposure variable used was wave. VA-TURF uses information obtained through rapid assessments except for the reef ecosystem component. The analytical approach for integrating scores is straightforward and devoid of highly sophisticated mathematical methods. The utility of VA-TURF primarily considers the fishers of a coastal community (barangay) as the major stakeholder, thereby facilitating familiarization and community ownership of the tool. VA-TURF was demonstrated in all the coastal barangays of two island municipalities (Lubang and Looc, Occidental Mindoro, Philippines) located along the Verde Island Passage, which has the world's highest marine shore fish biodiversity. Local stakeholders such as fishers, barangay leaders, residents, and local executive staff of the two municipalities participated in the process of scoring and determining the vulnerability of the sites during a series of workshops. The local-level fisheries vulnerability assessment framework developed encourages community-level actions and provides opportunities for strategic actions and scaling-up of efforts at various governance levels.

AB The Chesapeake Bay Ecological Prediction System (CBEPS) automatically generates daily nowcasts and three-day forecasts of several environmental variables, such as sea-surface temperature and salinity, the concentrations of chlorophyll, nitrate, and dissolved oxygen, and the likelihood of encountering several noxious species, including harmful algal blooms and water-borne pathogens, for the purpose of monitoring the Bay's ecosystem. While the physical and biogeochemical variables are forecast mechanistically using the Regional Ocean Modeling System configured for the Chesapeake Bay, the species predictions are generated using a novel mechanistic-empirical approach, whereby real-time output from the coupled physical-biogeochemical model drives multivariate empirical habitat models of the target species. The predictions, in the form of digital images, are available via the World Wide Web to interested groups to guide recreational, management, and research activities. Though full validation of the integrated forecasts for all species is still a work in progress, we argue that the mechanistic-empirical approach can be used to generate a wide variety of short-term ecological forecasts, and that it can be applied in any marine system where sufficient data exist to develop empirical habitat models. This paper provides an overview of this system, its predictions, and the approach taken. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB 1. Assessment of the performance of protected areas in conserving freshwater biodiversity has been limited, has mostly involved small-scale studies and has produced mixed findings. 2. I analysed monitoring data from Australia's Murray-Darling Basin (>10(6)km(2) and mostly arid or semi-arid) to compare fish assemblages between rivers inside and outside of protected areas. 3. The average richness and abundance of native species were significantly lower at sites within protected areas, but these sites were weighted towards steeper terrain and colder climates. 4. When analysis was confined to a subset of geographically and environmentally matched sites, the richness and abundance of native species did not differ significantly between protected and unprotected areas, and only two native species were significantly more abundant within protected areas, whereas another two were significantly more abundant outside. 5. Synthesis and applications. Protected status probably has little effect on native fish in the Murray-Darling Basin because it does not, by itself, exclude threats such as alien fish and alteration of water regimes. My findings therefore support the view that reserves need to be designed and managed specifically for freshwater species if they are to be most effective in their conservation. In the Murray-Darling Basin, and in similar regions around the world, actions such as greater control of alien species and allocation of adequate environmental flows will likely be critical to enabling protected areas to realize their potential for aquatic conservation.

AB Biological assessments of river conditions are increasingly conducted at regional and continental scales that match the extent of large-scale river management efforts. Multimetric indices composed of biological community indicators are commonly used to assess ecological condition and indices have recently been applied in large regions. Methods for large-scale multimetric index creation emphasize repeatability, comparability across regions, and objective selection of candidate metrics. Here we used an extensive fish dataset to create a large pool of fish community metrics which were screened to create multimetric indices (MMIs) in eight ecoregions covering the conterminous U.S. Candidate metrics were tested for metric range, corrected for natural gradients using boosted regression trees, and then tested for repeatability and sensitivity to landscape disturbance. Temporally stable and repeatable metrics were then evaluated for redundancy and used to compose MMIs for each region. Our MMIs were significantly correlated to independently developed MMIs, accurately reproducing prior index values with moderate to high precision and little bias. Our study demonstrates the utility of boosted regression tree models for correcting metric values for natural abiotic gradients and shows that the order of screening tests has a potentially important influence on metric selection. The resultant regional indices and component metrics provide a basis for assessing condition and testing hypotheses about landscape influences on aquatic ecosystems at a national scale in the US.

AB Aim We aimed to assess the generality of existing models of late Quaternary biodiversity refugia in the Brazilian Atlantic forest by testing whether taxonomic identity and range descriptors influence the extent by which previously proposed models of forest (habitat) refugia successfully predict species' inferred refugial areas. Location Brazilian rain forest. Methods We compiled and filtered records of 14 animal species that belong to distantly related groups (spiders, harvestmen, scorpions, amphibians, birds, lizards and mammals) and show distinct distribution patterns within the Atlantic rain forest. Using MAXENT, we generated three distribution models for each species under different climatic scenarios (current, 6000 and 21,000years ago). Species-specific historically stable areas (refugia) were identified through the intersection of the three models. We then measured the amount of inclusion' of species-specific refugia within published forest refugia, and quantified filling' of the biome refugia by species-specific refugia. The influence of taxonomic distance between species and range descriptors were analysed. Results Current distribution models generated for the 14 species had high accuracy (AUC >0.9). Inclusion and filling, two uncorrelated metrics, varied among species and were not influenced by taxonomic identity. Species range characteristics influenced forest model filling only, with higher values found in widely distributed species (i.e. occurring from Northeastern to Southeastern Brazil). Main conclusions Species-specific and forest refugial areas are not necessarily the same. The power of forest refugial models to predict species-specific refugial area differs among species and may be influenced by range attributes. Species data suggests the existence of a large refugium in Southeast of Brazil, a result at odds with the currently available forest-wide models. The predictive power of forest refugial models is narrowed; we now better understand their applicability limits.

AB Population genetic tools can facilitate successful conservation and management of wildlife populations. However, the ability of such approaches to inform wildlife management and conservation programs depends upon assumptions linking genetic patterns to ecological processes, one implicit assumption usually being that genetic parameters (e.g., population genetic differentiation) estimated using a set of loci accurately reflect underlying demographic and microevolutionary forces affecting the population(s) under study. This is an important assumption because it also implies that we have acknowledged that genetic parameters estimated by a set of target loci inherently are associated with a sampling variance. Specifically, a perception exists that heterozygote deficits caused by biological mechanisms (e.g., a Wahlund effect) and null alleles can be differentiated by the expectation that the former leads to a concordant pattern across all loci, whereas the latter leads to locus-specific effects. We use Monte-Carlo simulation to demonstrate that these expectations do not always hold under biologically realistic conditions. Our analyses indicate that the conservative approach of discarding loci deviating from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium expectations could rob us of our most informative markers, weakening our ability to interpret biological phenomena.

AB The invasive Mediterranean fruit fly (medfly), Ceratitis capitata, is one of the major agricultural and economical pests globally. Understanding invasion risk and mitigation of medfly in agricultural landscapes requires knowledge of its population structure and dispersal patterns. Here, estimates of dispersal ability are provided in medfly from South Africa at three spatial scales using molecular approaches. Individuals were genotyped at 11 polymorphic microsatellite loci and a subset of individuals were also sequenced for the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit I gene. Our results show that South African medfly populations are generally characterized by high levels of genetic diversity and limited population differentiation at all spatial scales. This suggests high levels of gene flow among sampling locations. However, natural dispersal in C. capitata has been shown to rarely exceed 10 km. Therefore, documented levels of high gene flow in the present study, even between distant populations (> 1600 km), are likely the result of human-mediated dispersal or at least some form of long-distance jump dispersal. These findings may have broad applicability to other global fruit production areas and have significant implications for ongoing pest management practices, such as the sterile insect technique.

AB The timing or phenology of the annual cycle of phytoplankton biomass can be monitored to better understand the underpinnings of the marine ecosystem and assess its response to environmental change. Ten-year, global maps of the mean date of bloom onset, peak concentration and termination of bloom duration were constructed by extracting these phenological metrics from Generalized Linear Models (GLM) fit to time series of 1 degrees x 1 degrees daily estimates of SeaWiFS chlorophyll concentrations dating from September 1997 to December 2007 as well as to MODIS chlorophyll concentrations from July 2002 to July 2010. The fitted models quantitatively define the annual cycle of phytoplankton throughout the global ocean and from which a baseline of phenological characteristics was extracted. The analysis revealed regionally consistent patterns in the shape and timing of the annual cycle of chlorophyll concentration that are broadly consistent with other published studies. The results showed that a single bloom predominates over the global ocean with secondary, autumn blooms being limited in both location and spatial extent. Bloom duration tended to be zonally consistent, but meridionally complex and did not become progressively shorter with increasing latitude as is sometimes depicted. Both the shape of the annual cycle and the phenological climatologies can be used in future studies to detect significant departures over time.

AB Phylogeographic patterns of temperate species from the Mediterranean peninsulas have been investigated intensively. Nevertheless, as more phylogeographies become available, either unique patterns or new lines of concordance continue to emerge, providing new insights on the evolution of regional biotas. Here, we investigated the phylogeography and evolutionary history of the Italian crested newt, Triturus carnifex, through phylogenetic, molecular dating and population structure analyses of two mitochondrial gene fragments (ND2 and ND4; overall 1273 bp). We found three main mtDNA lineages having parapatric distribution and estimated divergence times between Late Pliocene and Early Pleistocene. One lineage (S) was widespread south of the northern Apennine chain and was further geographically structured into five sublineages, likely of Middle Pleistocene origin. The second lineage (C) was widespread throughout the Padano-Venetian plain and did not show a clear phylogeographic structure. The third lineage (N) was observed in only two populations located on western Croatia/Slovenia. Results of analysis of molecular variance suggested that partitioning populations according to the geographic distribution of these lineages and sublineages explains 76% of the observed genetic variation. The phylogeographic structure observed within T. carnifex and divergence time estimates among its lineages, suggest that responses to Pleistocene environmental changes in this single species have been as diverse as those found previously among several codistributed temperate species combined. Consistent with the landscape heterogeneity, physiographic features, and palaeogeographical evolution of its distribution range, these responses encompass multiple refugia along the Apennine chain, lowland refugia in large peri-coastal plains, and a 'cryptic' northern refugium.

AB Altered fire regimes are a driver of biodiversity decline. To plan effective management, we need to know how species are influenced by fire and to develop theory describing fire responses. Animal responses to fire are usually measured using methods that rely on animal activity, but animal activity may vary with time since fire, potentially biasing results. Using a novel approach for detecting bias in the pit-fall trap method, we found that leaf-litter dependent reptiles were more active up to 6 weeks after fire, giving a misleading impression of abundance. This effect was not discovered when modelling detectability with zero-inflated binomial models. Two species without detection bias showed early-successional responses to time since fire, consistent with a habitat-accommodation succession model. However, a habitat specialist did not have the predicted low abundance after fire due to increased post-fire movement and non-linear recovery of a key habitat component. Interactions between fire and other processes therefore must be better understood to predict reptile responses to changing fire-regimes. We conclude that there is substantial bias when trapping reptiles after fire, with species that are otherwise hard to detect appearing to be abundant. Studies that use a survey method based on animal activity such as bird calls or animal movements, likely face a similar risk of bias when comparing recently-disturbed with control sites.

AB Climate changes have important consequences for plant communities and their root symbionts. The distribution of tree species within temperate, boreal and tropical biomes will be altered, as palaeoecological studies have demonstrated for previous climate change events. Predicted effects on ectomycorrhizal (ECM) associations include migration of host and symbiont, modification of interactions between plant and fungal species, and changes in the contribution of both partners to the global carbon cycle. Anthropogenic factors introduce new variables, affecting the ability of tree species and their fungal associates to disperse in response to climate change. Here we focus on how ECM fungi and their hosts respond to atmospheric CO2 enrichment, increasing temperatures, nutrient addition, species invasions, loss of biodiversity and anthropogenic land-use changes, particularly silviculture. All of these factors are key to understanding the impacts of climate change on the ECM symbiosis, and relevant future topics of research are presented.

Given the importance of traits as predictors of niche complementarity and community structures, we (1) examine how the diversity sensu lato of forest trees, freshwater fishes and soil invertebrates might support ecosystem functioning and (2) discuss the relevance of productive biota for monophyletic assemblages (taxocenes).
   In terrestrial ecosystems, correlating traits to abiotic factors is complicated by the appropriate choice of body-size distributions. Angiosperm and gymnosperm trees, for example, show metabolic incongruences in their respiration rates despite their pronounced macroecological scaling. Scaling heterotrophic organisms within their monophyletic assemblages seems more difficult than scaling autotrophs: in contrast to the generally observed decline of mass-specific metabolic rates with body mass within metazoans, soil organisms such as protozoans show opposite mass-specific trends.
   At the community level, the resource demand of metazoans shapes multitrophic interactions. Hence, population densities and their food web relationships reflect functional diversity, but the influence of biodiversity on stability and ecosystem functioning remains less clear. We focused on fishes in 18 riverine food webs, where the ratio of primary versus secondary extinctions (hereafter, 'extinction partitioning') summarizes the responses of fish communities to primary species loss (deletions) and its consequences. Based on extinction partitioning, our high-diversity food webs were just as (or even more) vulnerable to extinctions as low-diversity food webs.
   Our analysis allows us to assess consequences of the relocation or removal of fish species and to help with decision-making in sustainable river management. The study highlights that the topology of food webs (and not simply taxonomic diversity) plays a greater role in stabilizing the food web and enhancing ecological services than is currently acknowledged.

AB Languages, like genes, evolve by a process of descent with modification. This striking similarity between biological and linguistic evolution allows us to apply phylogenetic methods to explore how languages, as well as the people who speak them, are related to one another through evolutionary history. Language phylogenies constructed with lexical data have so far revealed population expansions of Austronesian, Indo-European and Bantu speakers. However, how robustly a phylogenetic approach can chart the history of language evolution and what language phylogenies reveal about human prehistory must be investigated more thoroughly on a global scale. Here we report a phylogeny of 59 Japonic languages and dialects. We used this phylogeny to estimate time depth of its root and compared it with the time suggested by an agricultural expansion scenario for Japanese origin. In agreement with the scenario, our results indicate that Japonic languages descended from a common ancestor approximately 2182 years ago. Together with archaeological and biological evidence, our results suggest that the first farmers of Japan had a profound impact on the origins of both people and languages. On a broader level, our results are consistent with a theory that agricultural expansion is the principal factor for shaping global linguistic diversity.

AB It has recently become practicable to estimate the effective sizes (N-e) of multiple populations within species. Such efforts are valuable for estimating N-e in evolutionary modeling and conservation planning. We used microsatellite loci to estimate N-e of 90 populations of four ranid frog species (20-26 populations per species, mean n per population = 29). Our objectives were to determine typical values of N-e for populations of each species, compare N-e estimates among the species, and test for correlations between several geographic variables and N-e within species. We used single-sample linkage disequilibrium (LD), approximate Bayesian computation (ABC), and sibship assignment (SA) methods to estimate contemporary N-e for each population. Three of the species-Rana pretiosa, R. luteiventris, and R. cascadae-have consistently small effective population sizes (< 50). N-e in Lithobates pipiens spans a wider range, with some values in the hundreds or thousands. There is a strong east-to-west trend of decreasing N-e in L. pipiens. The smaller effective sizes of western populations of this species may be related to habitat fragmentation and population bottlenecking.

AB Bodies of water are a key foraging habitat for insectivorous bats. Since water is a scarce and limiting resource in arid environments, bodies of open water may have a structuring effect on desert bat communities, resulting in temporal or spatial partitioning of bat activity. Using acoustic monitoring, we studied the spatial and temporal activity patterns of insectivorous bats over desert ponds, and hypothesised that sympatric bat species partition the foraging space above ponds based on interspecific competitive interactions. We used indirect measures of competition (niche overlap and competition coefficients from the regression method) and tested for differences in pond habitat selection and peak activity time over ponds. We examined the effect of changes in the activity of bat species on their potential competitors. We found that interspecific competition affects bat community structure and activity patterns. Competing species partitioned their use of ponds spatially, whereby each species was associated with different pond size and hydroperiod (the number of months a pond holds water) categories, as well as temporally, whereby their activity peaked at different hours of the night. The drying out of temporary ponds increased temporal partitioning over permanent ponds. Differences in the activity of species over ponds in response to the presence or absence of their competitors lend further support to the role of interspecific competition in structuring desert bat communities. We suggest that habitat use and night activity pattern of insectivorous bats in arid environments reflect the trade-offs between selection of preferred pond type or activity time and constraints posed by competitive interactions.

AB Global predictions of increasing mean temperature and its variance result in concerns about the fate of biodiversity under future climatic conditions. On the local scale of interacting species, the response of diversity to warming will depend much on the change in interspecific interactions such as competition or predation. Using a phytoplankton model community, we conducted a 2 x 2 x 2 factorial long-term microcosm experiment (16 months) with an underlying seasonal temperature profile. We manipulated the mean temperature (T-mean), the temperature variance (T-var), and the presence of consumers (ciliates) and monitored treatment effects on algal biomass, species composition and species richness. Temperature effects on algal biomass depended on the seasonal development and consumer presence. Algal biomass decreased with increasing T-mean at consumer absence, but increased at consumer presence. Overall, algal biomass decreased with increasing T-var. Consumer presence reduced algal biomass from summer to winter, but then ciliates and the consumer effect disappeared. Almost all treatment combinations collapsed to monocultures after 16 months, but extinction occurred faster at higher T-mean (especially at consumer absence) and slower at consumer presence (especially at higher T-mean). Contrasting our predictions, increasing T-var reduced richness and increased extinction rate. The treatment effects on biomass and richness were not independent, as algal species richness and biomass were positively correlated. Moreover, accelerated loss of species was consistently correlated to higher temporal variability in biomass. In conclusion, altered temperature regimes strongly affected algal biomass and diversity by interdependently altering competitive and consumer interactions.

AB Stronger selection on males has the potential to lower the deleterious mutation load of females, reducing the cost of sex. However, few studies have directly quantified the strength of selection for both sexes. As the magnitude of inbreeding depression (ID) is related to the strength of selection, we measured the cost of inbreeding for both males and females in a laboratory population of Drosophila melanogaster. Using a novel technique for inbreeding, we found significant ID for both juvenile viability and adult fitness in both sexes. The genetic variation responsible for this depression in fitness appeared to be recessive for adult fitness (h = 0.11) and partially additive for juvenile viability (h = 0.29). ID was identical across the sexes in terms of juvenile viability but was significantly more deleterious for males than females as adults, even though female X-chromosome homogamety should predispose them to a higher inbreeding load. We estimated the strength of selection on adult males to be 1.24 greater than on adult females, and this appears to be a consequence of selection arising from competition for mates. Combined with the generally positive intersexual genetic correlation for inbred lines, our results suggest that the mutation load of sexual females could be meaningfully reduced by stronger selection acting on males.

AB The intensification of aridity due to anthropogenic climate change in the southwestern U. S. is likely to have a large impact on the growth and survival of plant species that may already be vulnerable to water stress. To make accurate predictions of plant responses to climate change, it is essential to determine the long-term dynamics of plant species associated with past climate conditions. Here we show how the plant species and functional types across a wide range of environmental conditions in Colorado Plateau national parks have changed with climate variability over the last twenty years. During this time, regional mean annual temperature increased by 0.18 degrees C per year from 1989-1995, 0.06 degrees C per year from 1995-2003, declined by 0.14 degrees C from 2003-2008, and there was high interannual variability in precipitation. Non-metric multidimensional scaling of plant species at long-term monitoring sites indicated five distinct plant communities. In many of the communities, canopy cover of perennial plants was sensitive to mean annual temperature occurring in the previous year, whereas canopy cover of annual plants responded to cool season precipitation. In the perennial grasslands, there was an overall decline of C-3 perennial grasses, no change of C-4 perennial grasses, and an increase of shrubs with increasing temperature. In the shrublands, shrubs generally showed no change or slightly increased with increasing temperature. However, certain shrub species declined where soil and physical characteristics of a site limited water availability. In the higher elevation woodlands, Juniperus osteosperma and shrub canopy cover increased with increasing temperature, while Pinus edulis at the highest elevation sites was unresponsive to interannual temperature variability. These results from well-protected national parks highlight the importance of temperature to plant responses in a water-limited region and suggest that projected increases in aridity are likely to promote grass loss and shrub expansion on the Colorado Plateau.

AB Exogenous disturbances are critical agents of change in temperate forests capable of damaging trees and influencing forest structure, composition, demography, and ecosystem processes. Forest disturbances of intermediate magnitude and intensity receive relatively sparse attention, particularly at landscape scales, despite influencing most forests at least once per generation. Contextualizing the spatial extent and heterogeneity of such damage is of paramount importance to increasing our understanding of forested ecosystems. We investigated patterns of intermediate wind disturbance across a forested landscape in the northern Great Lakes, USA. A vegetation change tracker (VCT) algorithm was utilized for processing near-biennial Landsat data stacks (1984-2009) spanning forests sustaining damage from four recent windstorms. VCT predominantly maps stand-clearing disturbance and regrowth patterns, which were used to identify forest boundaries, young stands, and disturbance patterns across space and time. To map wind damage severity, we compared satellite-derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) values calculated from pre- and post-storm Landsat imagery. A geographic information system (GIS) was used to derive wind damage predictor variables from VCT, digital terrain, soils/landform, land cover, and storm tracking data. Hierarchical and random forests regressions were applied to rank the relative importance of predictor variables in influencing wind damage.
   A conservative estimate of aggregate damage from the intermediate windstorms (extrapolated to similar to 150,000 ha, similar to 25,500 severe) rivaled individual large, infrequent disturbances in the region. Damage patterns were relatively congruent among storms and became more spatially heterogeneous with increasing disturbance intensity. Proximity to forest-nonforest edge, stand age, and soils/landform were consistently important damage predictors. The spatial extent and distribution of the first two damage predictors are extremely sensitive to anthropogenic modifications of forested landscapes, the most important disturbance agent in the northern Great Lakes. This provides circumstantial evidence suggesting anthropogenic activities are augmenting and/or diminishing the ecological effects of the natural wind disturbance regime. Natural disturbances of intermediate size and intensity are significant agents of change in this region, and likely in other regions, deserving more attention from ecologists and biogeographers.

AB This 14-year study (1989-2003) develops recovery benchmarks based on a period of very strong coral recovery in Acropora-dominated assemblages on the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) following major setbacks from the predatory sea-star Acanthaster planci in the early 1980s. A space for time approach was used in developing the benchmarks, made possible by the choice of three study reefs (Green Island, Feather Reef and Rib Reef), spread along 3 degrees of latitude (300 km) of the GBR. The sea-star outbreaks progressed north to south, causing death of corals that reached maximum levels in the years 1980 (Green), 1982 (Feather) and 1984 (Rib). The reefs were initially surveyed in 1989, 1990, 1993 and 1994, which represent recovery years 5-14 in the space for time protocol. Benchmark trajectories for coral abundance, colony sizes, coral cover and diversity were plotted against nominal recovery time (years 5-14) and defined as non-linear functions. A single survey of the same three reefs was conducted in 2003, when the reefs were nominally 1, 3 and 5 years into a second recovery period, following further Acanthaster impacts and coincident coral bleaching events around the turn of the century. The 2003 coral cover was marginally above the benchmark trajectory, but colony density (colonies.m(-2)) was an order of magnitude lower than the benchmark, and size structure was biased toward larger colonies that survived the turn of the century disturbances. The under-representation of small size classes in 2003 suggests that mass recruitment of corals had been suppressed, reflecting low regional coral abundance and depression of coral fecundity by recent bleaching events. The marginally higher cover and large colonies of 2003 were thus indicative of a depleted and aging assemblage not yet rejuvenated by a strong cohort of recruits.

AB The community structure, stable isotope ratios (N-15/N-14, C-13/C-12) and reproductive mode of oribatid mites (Acari, Oribatida) were investigated in four habitats (upper tree bark, lower tree bark, dry grassland soil, forest soil) at two sites in the Central Alps (Tyrol, Austria). We hypothesized that community structure and trophic position of oribatid mites of dry grassland soils and bark of trees are similar since these habitats have similar abiotic characteristics (open, dry) compared with forest soil. Further, we hypothesized that derived taxa of oribatid mites reproducing sexually dominate on the bark of trees since species in this habitat consume living resources such as lichens. In contrast to our hypothesis, the community structure of oribatid mites differed among grassland, forest and bark indicating the existence of niche differentiation in the respective oribatid mite species. In agreement with our hypothesis, sexually reproducing taxa of oribatid mites dominated on the bark of trees whereas parthenogenetic species were more frequent in soil. Several species of bark-living oribatid mites had stable isotope signatures that were similar to lichens indicating that they feed on lichens. However, nine species that frequently occurred on tree bark did not feed on lichens according to their stable isotope signatures. No oribatid mite species could be ascribed to moss feeding. We conclude that sexual reproduction served as preadaptation for oribatid mites allowing them to exploit new habitats and new resources on the bark of trees. Abiotic factors likely are of limited importance for bark-living oribatid mites since harsh abiotic conditions are assumed to favor parthenogenesis.

AB This article examines the role of the Late Pleistocene climatic changes in the disappearance of the European populations of spotted hyenas. A species distribution model was built using both current and past environmental requirements of the species. Model projections were made with climatic scenarios provided by the GENESIS 2.0 General Circulation Model (126 ka, 42 ka, 30 ka and 21 ka). Those projections indicate (1) that during the Late Pleistocene warm scenarios spotted hyenas should have been widespread in Europe, and (2) that during the last glacial maximum their potential climatically suitable geographic distribution diminished in size. The decrease in the potential climatic distribution was strictly restricted to Northern Europe. Climatic conditions in Southern Europe during the Late Pleistocene remained within the spotted hyena climatic tolerance. Hence, climate changes could have directly affected the Northern distribution of the species during the last glaciations. However, climate change alone is not sufficient to have caused the disappearance of the spotted hyena populations in Southern Europe. That is, other factors, such as prey abundance or human ecological impacts, in addition to climatic change, are needed to completely account for extinction of the European spotted hyena.

AB Background: The chamois, distributed over most of the medium to high altitude mountain ranges of southern Eurasia, provides an excellent model for exploring the effects of historical and evolutionary events on diversification. Populations have been grouped into two species, Rupicapra pyrenaica from southwestern Europe and R. rupicapra from eastern Europe. However, a previous study of cytochrome b revealed that the two proposed species were non-monophyletic. The reconstruction of phylogenetic relationships between animal species often depends on the markers studied. To further elucidate the evolutionary history of chamois, we extended earlier studies by analysing DNA sequences of four mitochondrial regions (ND1, 12S, tRNApro and Control Region) and microsatellites (20 loci) to include all subspecies and cover its entire distribution range.
   Results: We found discordant microsatellite (mu sat) and mitochondrial (mt) DNA phylogenies. Mitochondrial phylogenies form three clades, West, Central and East (mtW, mtC and mtE), at variance with taxonomic classification. Our divergence age estimates indicate an initial separation into branches mtW-mtC and mtE 1.7 million years ago (mya), in the late Pliocene-early Pleistocene, quickly followed by the split of clades mtW and mtC. Clade mtW contains haplotypes from the Iberian peninsula and the western Alps, Clade mtC includes haplotypes from the Apennines and the Massif of Chartreuse and Clade mtE comprises populations to the east of the Alps. Divergence among populations within these three major clades is recent (< 0.5 mya). New microsatellite multilocus genotypes added to previously published data revealed differences between every pair of subspecies, forming three well defined groups (mu satW, mu satC and mu satE) also with a strong geographic signature. Grouping does not correspond with the mitochondrial lineages but is closer to morphology and taxonomic classification. Recent drastic reductions in population size can be noted for the subspecies ornata as an extremely low diversity.
   Conclusions: The phylogeographic patterns for mtDNA and microsatellites suggest an evolutionary history with limited range contractions and expansions during the Quaternary period and reflect a major effect of the Alpine barrier on west-east differentiation. The contrasting phylogenies for mtDNA and microsatellites indicate events of hybridization among highly divergent lineages in the central area of distribution. Our study points to the importance of reticulate evolution, with periods of isolation and reduction of population size followed by expansions and hybridizations, in the diversification at the level of close species or subspecies.

AB Cultured organisms undergo genetically-based behavioural changes that may reduce their ability to survive in the wild. This has raised concerns that interbreeding between escaped cultured and wild organisms will generate hybrids exhibiting maladaptive behaviours which may ultimately reduce the fitness of the wild counterpart. We compared anti-predator responses in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) from two wild North American populations, the major farmed strain used in regional aquaculture, and their wild-farmed hybrids (F(1), F(2), and wild backcross). Anti-predator responses of fry (age 0+ parr) were measured under common environmental conditions, using a model of a natural predator (belted kingfisher, Ceryle alcyon). Farmed fry exhibited significantly reduced anti-predator responses relative to fry from both wild populations. The anti-predator responses of wild-farmed hybrid fry were intermediate to those of the parental populations (pure farmed or wild). The magnitude by which wild-farmed hybrids differed in anti-predator responses from pure wild fish also depended on the wild population. These results suggest that: (1) the observed behavioural differences have a genetic basis; (2) wild-farmed hybrids have, on average, reduced anti-predator responses relative to wild fish; and that (3) the effects of wild-farmed interbreeding on anti-predator responses will differ between wild populations. Our study is consistent with the general hypothesis that continual farmed-wild interbreeding may have detrimental effects on the fitness of wild organisms.

AB Introduction of wildlife for game restocking is one major pathway of genetic homogenization. The red-legged partridge (Alectoris rufa, Phasianidae), a small game bird native to south-western Europe, is in high demand by hunters and natural populations are constantly supplemented by commercial stocks of captive-bred individuals. Also, in recent years human-mediated hybridization with congeneric chukar partridges (Alectoris chukar: Greece, Cyprus, from Middle East to East Asia) has been frequently documented in the wild and in captivity. This study attempts to evaluate the genetic consequences of intensive captive breeding and restocking in the A. rufa species. We investigated A. rufa genetic diversity by making comparisons in both a spatial (across the entire species' range) and a temporal framework. We accomplished this latter by comparing modern vs. ancient partridges resident in museums and collected 1856-1934, well before supplemental stocking became common. Using mtDNA we found significant changes in the haplotype profile of modern vs. ancient A. rufa, and widespread introgression with chukar genes across the entire species range only in modern representatives, with the relevant exception of Corsican populations. However, Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD), as opposed to microsatellite DNA markers, showed also modern Corsican populations to harbour many A. rufa x A. chukar hybrids. We conclude that captive breeding programs should make strict use of time-saving and comparatively low cost DNA barcodes to minimize genetic pollution, such as those provided by diagnostic RAPD markers. We also recommend that the active ban on import of exotics and/or hybrids be extended to non-local populations. Altogether this would represent a substantial step forward to preserve A. rufa as well as other game species subjected to similar intensive management. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Aim
   The small island effect (SIE), i.e. the hypothesis that species richness below a certain threshold area varies independently of island size, has become a widely accepted part of the theory of island biogeography. However, there are doubts whether the findings of SIEs were based on appropriate methods. The aim of this study was thus to provide a statistically sound methodology for the detection of SIEs and to show this by re-analysing data in which an SIE has recently been claimed (Sfenthourakis & Triantis, 2009, Diversity and Distributions, 15, 131-140).
   Location
   Ninety islands of the Aegean Sea (Greece).
   Methods
   First, I reviewed publications on SIEs and evaluated their methodology. Then, I fitted different species-area models to the published data of area (A) and species richness (S) of terrestrial isopods (Oniscidea), with log A as predictor and both S (logarithm function) and log S (power function) as response variables: (i) linear; (ii) quadratic; (iii) cubic; (iv) breakpoint with zero slope to the left (SIE model); (v) breakpoint with zero slope to the right; (vi) two-slope model. I used non-linear regression with R2(adj.), AIC(c) and BIC as goodness-of-fit measures.
   Results
   Many different methods have been applied for detecting SIEs, all of them with serious shortcomings. Contrary to the claim of the original study, no SIE occurs in this particular dataset as the two-slope variants performed better than the SIE variants for both the logarithm and power functions.
   Main conclusions
   For the unambiguous detection of SIEs, one needs to (i) include islands with no species; (ii) compare all relevant models; and (iii) account for different model complexities. As none of the reviewed SIE studies met all these criteria, their findings are dubious and SIEs may be less common than reported. Thus, conservation-related predictions based on the assumption of SIEs may be unreliable.

AB The spatial distribution of the American lobster Homarus americanus is influenced by many factors, which are often difficult to quantify. We implemented a modeling approach for quantifying season-, size-, and sex-specific lobster spatial distribution in the Gulf of Maine with respect to environmental and spatial variables including bottom temperature, bottom salinity, latitude, longitude, depth, distance offshore, and 2 substratum features. Lobster distribution was strongly associated with temperature and depth, and differed seasonally by sex. In offshore waters in the fall, females were dominant at higher latitudes and males at lower latitudes. This segregation was not apparent in the spring although females were still dominant at higher latitudes in offshore waters. Juveniles and adults were also distributed differently; juveniles were more abundant at the lower latitudes in inshore waters, while adults were more widespread along the entire coast. These patterns are consistent with the ecology of the American lobster. This study provides a tool to evaluate changes in lobster spatial distribution with respect to changes in key habitat and other environmental variables, and consequently could be of value for the management of the American lobster.

AB Declines in habitat quality through the breeding season within a bird's home-range can limit overall productivity. In environments where multiple breeding opportunities arise during the course of a season, these effects can be buffered by a shift to different breeding sites or habitats. We studied the distribution and habitat associations of a crop-nesting farmland bird, the Yellow Wagtail Motacilla flava, across an arable-dominated farming region in eastern England using both field-scale territory mapping and large-scale transect surveys. Surveys were repeated at monthly intervals to measure changes in both distribution and habitat use during the course of the season. The distribution of breeding birds changed markedly at both regional and field-scales, coinciding with a shift in crop preference. Initially, most territorial birds were recorded in autumn-sown cereal fields, but this crop was subsequently abandoned in favour of potato crops, which were more patchily distributed. Other habitat features influencing Yellow Wagtail distribution included local crop diversity, hedgerow presence and soil type, with organic soils supporting higher abundance than alluvial clays or silts. The mid-season switch in habitat associations might allow individuals to maximize the number of breeding attempts made in a single year by using multiple habitats sequentially. The use of multiple habitats could influence population regulation by buffering the effects of local within-season declines in habitat suitability. Seasonal habitat switching may be more prevalent than is currently recognized in seasonal environments.

AB Decline of marine fisheries has become one of the most severe global environmental crises. In typical fishery management efforts, fish populations are often treated as homogeneous units, thereby tacitly ignoring potential intrapopulation variation within taxonomic groupings. We used acoustic telemetry and stable isotope analysis to examine movement patterns of 20 gray snapper Lutjanus griseus and 20 schoolmaster snapper L. apodus in a Bahamian tidal creek and wetland. In particular, we examined (1) if intrapopulation variation in fish habitat use and movement patterns existed, (2) whether that variation was a function of body size, and (3) if there was evidence of specialization in habitat use among individuals. We found that movement varied substantially among individuals, but was independent of body size. Some individuals exhibited frequent, repeated, movements to certain areas of the study site. delta C-13 values of individual snapper were significantly related to movement metrics, suggesting that movement differences were related to specific patterns of foraging behavior. Our findings suggest the importance of incorporating intrapopulation niche variation-a source of variation that is often overlooked in traditional conservation and management strategies-into the study of coastal fish populations.

AB Although only a few Studies have explicitly evaluated live-dead agreement of species and community responses to environmental and spatial gradients, paleoecological analyses implicitly assume that death assemblages capture these gradients accurately. We use nine data sets from modern, relatively undisturbed coastal study areas to evaluate how the response of living molluscan assemblages to environmental gradients (water depth and seafloor type; "environmental component" of a gradient) and geographic separation ("spatial component") is captured by their death assemblages. We find that:
   1. Living assemblages vary in composition either in response to environmental gradients alone (consistent with a species-sorting model) or in response to a combination of environmental and spatial gradients (mass-effect model). None of the living assemblages support the neutral model (or the patch-dynamic model), in which variation in species abundance is related to the spatial configuration of stations alone. These findings also Support assumptions that mollusk species consistently differ in responses to environmental gradients, and suggest that in the absence of postmortem bias, environmental gradients might be accurately captured by variation in species composition among death assemblages. Death assemblages L in fact respond uniquely to environmental gradients, and show a stronger response when abundances are square-root transformed to downplay the impact of numerically abundant species and increase the effect of rare species.
   2. Species' niche positions (position of maximum abundance) along bathymetric and sedimentary gradients in death assemblages show significantly positive rank correlations to species positions in living assemblages in seven of nine data sets (both square-root-transformed and presence-absence data).
   3. The proportion of compositional variation explained by environmental gradients in death assemblages is similar to that of counterpart living assemblages. Death assemblages thus show the same ability to capture environmental gradients as do living assemblages. In some instances compositional dissimilarities in death assemblages show higher rank correlation with spatial distances than with environmental gradients, but spatial structure in community composition is mainly driven by spatially structured environmental gradients.
   4. Death assemblages correctly identify the dominance of niche metacommunity models in mollusk communities, as revealed by counterpart living assemblages. This analysis of the environmental resolution of death assemblages thus supports fine-scale niche and paleoenvironmental analyses using molluscan fossil records. In spite of taphonomic processes and time-averaging effects that modify community composition, death assemblages largely capture the response of living communities to environmental gradients, partly because of redundancy in community structure that is inherently associated with multispecies assemblages. The Molluscan data sets show some degree of redundancy as evidenced by the presence of at least two mutually exclusive subsets of species that replicate the community structure, and simple simulations show that between-sample relationships can be preserved and remain significant even when a large proportion of species is randomly removed from data sets.

AB Climate change affects all levels of biology and is a major threat for biodiversity. Hence, it is fundamental to run biodiversity monitoring programs to understand the effects of climate change on the biota and to be able to adjust management and conservation accordingly. So far, however, very few existing monitoring programs allow for the detection of climate change effects, as shown by a survey undertaken by the European project EuMon. Despite this shortcoming, several methods exist which allow to make inferences from existing data by integrating data across different monitoring programs: correlative analyses, meta-analyses and models. In addition, experiments are thought to be useful tools to understand the effects of climate change on plants and animals. Here, we evaluate the utility of these four main approaches. All these methods allow to evaluate long term effects of climate change and make predictions of species' future development, but they are arguable. We list and compare their benefits and inconveniences, which can lead to uncertainties in the extrapolation of species responses to global climate change. Individual characteristics and population parameters have to be more frequently monitored. The potential evolution of a species should be also modelled, to extrapolate results across spatial and temporal scales as well as to analyse the combined effects of different climatic and biotic factors, including intra but also interspecific relationships. We conclude that a combination of methodologies would be the most promising tool for the assessment of biological responses to climate change, and we provide some thoughts about how to do so. Particularly, we encourage long-term studies along natural gradients (altitudinal or latitudinal) on the same species/habitats to be able to extrapolate to large geographic scales, and to have more complete data sets, necessary to understand the mechanisms of responses. Such data may provide a more accurate base for simulations across spatial and temporal scales, especially if they are publicly available in a common database. These recommendations could allow the adaptation of species management and the development of conservation tools to climate change which threatens species.

AB Wild boar Sus scrofa L. rooting is a large and frequent disturbance, very extended all over the world. However, its impact in some sensitive habitats, such as alpine and subalpine grasslands remains unknown. These grasslands are considered important sites for biological conservation and traditional grazing activities, and are frequently affected by wild boar rootings. In this study, we selected three study sites representing a range of scenarios in Pyrenean alpine and subalpine grasslands, with differing protection status and grazing management. We assessed the extent of wild boar rooting, and determined the main variables that influence their distribution, taking into account the interactions among them. Our results showed that wild boar rooting significantly affected alpine and subalpine grasslands in the Pyrenees especially in protected non-hunting areas (up to 12% of the surface). The distribution of disturbed areas was influenced by a hierarchical suite of variables, among which vegetation, that is certain plant communities, was the most important. The apparent preference for dense grasslands might be associated with its soil depth, soil hardness and diversity of feeding resources. The importance of other variables, such as topography, distance to primary resources or grazing management, was site dependent. A broad understanding of the effects of variables and their relationships provide insights into the actual factors affecting the rooting selection. We hypothesize that the selection of feeding habitat, followed by the conditions of the soil to be uprooted and human management, are the main underlying factors that shape the distribution of wild boar rooting in alpine and subalpine grasslands.

AB Understanding the impact of climate change on zooplankton populations is of major importance, as they represent the basis for higher trophic levels in the marine food web. In this study we analyze the 36-year copepod abundance time series in the Gulf of Trieste, northern Adriatic, to investigate its interannual variability, with particular attention to species trends and phenology. Following the analysis of the local winter sea surface temperature, two periods are identified: 1970-1987 and 1988-2005. These periods are characterized by ecosystem-wide changes: an approximate doubling in total copepod abundance, the arrival of a new species (Diaixis pygmoea), the rise (Paracalanus parvus, Oncaea spp., Oithona spp., and Euterpina acutifrons) or decline (Pseudocalanus elongatus, Clausocalanus spp.) of several taxa, and changes in the phenology in several species, with predominantly forward shifts in the timing of the maximum peak. While Acartia clausi remains the dominant species, there is a general trend toward smaller species in the second period. Our results also indicate the large, possibly critical, reduction in the abundance of the species Pseudocalanus elongatus. We hypothesize that the changes in copepod abundances and community composition in the Gulf of Trieste are related to the general warming in the sea surface temperature and associated northerly displacement of the ecosystem and to the changes in the Mediterranean circulation that began at the end of the 1980s and affected the whole basin in the following years as part of the phenomenon called the Eastern Mediterranean Transient.

AB Land-cover changes from the last decades are leading to important declines in habitat quality, giving rise to changes in bird species distribution all over the world. However, land-cover changes result from a variety of different processes, and it is not clear how effective species distribution models are in capturing species responses to these changes. In this study, we evaluated our ability to predict the effects of land-cover changes on shifts in species distributions at large spatial and temporal scales using Mediterranean landscapes and early-successional, open-habitat birds as study models. Based on presence-absence data from the second Catalan Breeding Bird Atlas (1999-2002), we applied six different species distribution modeling techniques for 10 bird species using climate, topographic, and land-cover data as predictor variables. Then we back-projected the models on land-cover conditions from 1980 to evaluate the projections with field observation data from the first Catalan Breeding Bird Atlas (1975-1983). Finally, we assessed if, in addition to changes in habitat suitability resulting from land-cover shifts, descriptors of. re impact contributed to further explain species distribution dynamics: colonization and local extinction.
   We developed accurate model projections of current and past global patterns of species distribution, but our ability to predict species distribution dynamics was reduced. Colonization dynamics were generally more strongly related to. re descriptors than to changes in overall habitat suitability derived from land-cover changes. Our results warn of the dangers of projecting species distribution models onto future conditions if processes behind species distribution dynamics are not explicitly included. Consideration of ecologically meaningful processes for species (i.e., fire disturbance) when modeling species' distribution might contribute to a better explanation of species' colonization dynamics.

AB The altitudinal pattern of genetic variation in Pinus hartwegii Lindl. populations was explored for seedling height growth, frost damage, grass-stage, and phenological stage of the terminal provenance test was conducted with open-pollinated seed from 13 populations collected along an altitudinal transect (3000-3600 m) at the National Park Pico de Tancitaro, Michoacan, center-west Mexico. Height growth of seedlings in a nursery was assessed at seven and 18 months of age. Frost damage at -15 degrees C was evaluated in laboratory at 18 months of age; proportion of plants that had left grass-stage and stage of shoot development was assessed at the age of 22 months. Significant differences among provenances (P < 0.0001) were detected for all of the evaluated characters. The variation among populations was structured as a moderate altitudinal cline, with populations from lower altitudes showing larger height growth in seedlings, larger proportion of frost damages, fewer seedlings in grass-stage and more seedlings with developed shoot, whereas in populations from higher altitudes, seedlings exhibiting shorter plant height, lower percentages of frost damage, more seedlings with unbroken grass-stage, and fewer seedlings with advanced shoot development were displayed. Options for seed and seedling movement along the altitudinal gradient are discussed under the scope of reforestation, aiming at ecological restoration, conservation of forest genetic resources, and assisted migration considering global warming. We suggest delineation of two altitudinal seed zones (Zone 1: 3000-3350 m; Zone II 3350-3700 m). (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Ecological Niche of the 2003 West Nile Virus Epidemic in the Northern
   Great Plains of the United States
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
AB Background: The incidence of West Nile virus(WNv) has remained high in the northern Great Plains compared to the rest of the United States. However, the reasons for the sustained high risk of WNv transmission in the regions have not been determined. To assess the environmental drivers of WNv in the northern Great Plains, we analyzed the county-level spatial pattern of human cases during the 2003 epidemic across a seven-state region.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: County-level data on WNv cases were examined using spatial cluster analysis, and were used to fit statistical models with weather, climate, and land use variables as predictors. In 2003 there was a single large cluster of elevated WNv risk encompassing North Dakota, South Dakota, and Nebraska along with portions of eastern Montana and Wyoming. The relative risk of WNv remained high within the boundaries of this cluster from 2004-2007. WNv incidence during the 2003 epidemic was found to have a stronger relationship with long-term climate patterns than with annual weather in either 2002 or 2003. WNv incidence increased with May-July temperature and had a unimodal relationship with total May-July precipitation. WNv incidence also increased with the percentage of irrigated cropland and with the percentage of the human population living in rural areas.
   Conclusion/Significance: The spatial pattern of WNv cases during the 2003 epidemic in the northern Great Plains was associated with both climatic gradients and land use patterns. These results were interpreted as evidence that environmental conditions across much of the northern Great Plains created a favorable ecological niche for Culex tarsalis, a particularly efficient vector of WNv. Further research is needed to determine the proximal causes of sustained WNv transmission and to enhance strategies for disease prevention.

AB Hemp (Cannabis sativa L.) is mainly grown for its fibre and is considered a desirable crop for sustainable production systems. In a field trial carried out over two years in Northern Italy the root system of a hemp crop, cultivated at contrasting plant densities, was sampled and analysed with an image analysis software. Root length density (RLD) was highest in the first 10 cm of soil, almost 5 cm cm(-3); it decreased progressively until the depth of 130 cm, a part from a peak at 90-100 cm in response to a perched water table. Roots were found to 130 cm of depth in one year and to 200 cm in the other. Root diameter was finer (190 mu m) in the upper soil layer, it increased with depth until 100 cm, and remained constant at 300 mu m thereafter. Following the same trend of RLD, root biomass was highest in the first soil layer; 50% of the root biomass was found in the first 20 cm or 50 cm when taproot biomass was considered or not. Total root biomass was 3.21 th a(-1) and 2.41 t ha(-1) in the two years of trial, but the ratio between aboveground and below ground biomass was constant at 5.46. None of the root parameters were significantly affected by plant population, which seems to confirm the plastic behaviour that hemp shows for aboveground development. The high root biomass production measured in this study, especially in deeper soil layers, provides additional evidence of the positive role that hemp can play in sustainable cropping systems.

AB Fine root morphological traits and distribution, arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi, soil fertility, and nutrient concentration in fine root tissue were compared in sites under different successional phases: grass plants, secondary forest, and mature forest in Londrina county, Parana state, southern Brazil. Soil cores were collected randomly at the 0-10- and 10-20-cm depths in three quadrants (50 m(2)) in each site. Plants from the different successional stages displayed high differences in fine root distribution, fine root traits, and mycorrhizal root colonization. There were increases in the concentration of nutrients both in soil and fine roots and decrease of bulk soil density along the succession. The fine root biomass and diameter increased with the succession progress. The total fine root length, specific root length, root hair length, and root hair incidence decreased with the succession advance. Similarly, the mycorrhizal root colonization and the density of AM fungi spores in the soil decreased along the succession. Mycorrhizal root colonization and spore density were positively correlated with fine root length, specific root length, root hair length, root hair incidence, and bulk density and negatively correlated with fine root diameter and concentration of some nutrients both in soil and root tissues. Nutrient concentration in root tissue and in soil was positively correlated with fine root diameter and negatively correlated with specific root length, root hair length, and root hair incidence. These results suggest different adaptation strategies of plant roots for soil exploration and mineral acquisition among the different successional stages. Early successional stages displayed plants with fine root morphology and AM fungi colonization to improve the root functional efficiencies for uptake of nutrients and faster soil resource exploration. Late successional stages displayed plants with fine root morphology and mycorrhizal symbiosis for both a lower rate of soil proliferation and soil exploration capacity to acquire nutrients.

AB 1. Population extinction is a fundamental ecological process. Recent experimental work has begun to test the large body of theory that predicts how demographic, genetic and environmental factors influence extinction risk. We review empirical studies of extinction conducted under controlled laboratory conditions. Our synthesis highlights four findings.
   First, extinction theory largely considers individual, isolated populations. However, species interactions frequently altered or even reversed the influence of environmental factors on population extinction as compared to single-species conditions, highlighting the need to integrate community ecology into population theory.
   2. While most single-species studies qualitatively agree with theoretical predictions, studies are needed that quantitatively compare observed and predicted extinction rates. A quantitative understanding of extinction processes is needed to further advance theory and to predict population extinction resulting from human activities.
   3. Many stresses leading to population extinction can be assuaged by migration between subpopulations. However, too much migration increases synchrony between subpopulations and thus increases extinction risk. Research is needed to determine how to strike a balance that maximizes the benefit of migration.
   4. Results from laboratory experiments often conflict with field studies. Understanding these inconsistencies is crucial for extending extinction theory to natural populations.

AB A 3-year field trial examined in a long-term no-till system the effects of surface-applied lime and cover black oat (Avena strigosa Schreb) residues on soil chemical attributes, root growth and grain yield of corn (Zea mays L.) and soybean (Glycine max L. Merrill) on a loamy, kaolinitic, thermic Typic Hapludox in Parana State, Brazil. The treatments consisted of dolomitic lime broadcast on the soil surface at 0 or 12 t/ha, with and without cover of black oat residues. Corn and soybeans were grown without rainfall limitation. Applying lime on the surface improved soil acidity and decreased aluminium (Al) toxicity to a 10-cm depth 1 year after application. Surface liming increased pH and the content of exchangeable Ca2+ to a 20-cm depth, and decreased Al toxicity to a 40- to 60-cm depth 3 years after application, indicating that the surface-applied lime moved deeper. Cover black oat residues did not favour the mobility of surface-applied lime to alleviate subsoil acidity and an increase in the Al3+ saturation level at the soil surface was found in unlimited plots with black oat residues. Root growth and grain yields of corn and soybean were not influenced by surface liming with or without cover black oat residue. Despite the soil acidity level, root length of corn and soybean ranged from 55 to 60% at 0- to 10-cm depth. The results suggest that Al toxicity is low in no-till systems during cropping seasons with adequate and well-distributed rainfall, but this effect is not related to the presence of cover oat residues.

AB Extrinsic and intrinsic forces combined shape the population structure of every species differently. Freshwater mussels are obligate parasites to a host fish during a juvenile stage (glochidia). Elliptio dilatata (ED) and Actinonaias ligamentina (AL) are co-occurring freshwater mussel taxa with similar North American distribution and share some potential host fish. Using mitochondrial DNA, we determined the genotypes of 190 + individuals from collection sites in at least two tributaries in the Lake Erie and Ohio River watersheds, along with the Ouachita and Strawberry rivers in the southeast. Both species had followed a stepping-stone model of dispersal, with greater pairwise genetic structure among collection sites of ED. Also, phylogeographical analysis for ED found significant geographical structuring of haplotype diversity. Overall, within-population variation increased significantly from north to south, with low genetic diversity in the Strawberry River. We calculated significant among-population structure for both species (ED: Phi(ST) = 0.62, P < 0.001; AL: Phi(ST) = 0.16, P < 0.001). Genetic analysis identified the Ouachita River as an area of significant reproductive isolation for both species. Results for AL indicated dispersal into northern areas from two genetically distinct glacial refugia, where results for ED indicated dispersal followed by low gene flow in northern areas. The conservation strategies for mussels that co-occur in the same 'bed' could be species specific. Species such as ED have management units on the population scale, where AL has a more homogeneous genetic structure across its range.

AB We examined effects of a first nitrogen (N) fertilizer application on upper-canopy needle morphology and gas exchange in similar to 20-m-tall loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) exposed to elevated carbon dioxide concentration ([CO2]) for 9 years. Duke Forest free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) plots were split and half of each ring fertilized with 112 kg ha(-1) elemental N applied in two applications in March and April 2005. Measurements of needle length (L), mass per unit area (LMA), N concentration (N-1) on a mass and an area basis, light-saturated net photosynthesis per unit leaf area (A(a)) and per unit mass (A), and leaf conductance (90 began after the second fertilizer application in existing 1-year-old foliage (F-O) and later in developing current-year first-flush (F-C1) and current-year second-flush (F-C2) foliage. Elevated [CO2] increased A(a) by 43 and 52% in F-O and F-C1, foliage, respectively, but generally had no significant effect on any other parameter. Fertilization had little or no significant effect on L, LMA, A or g(L) in F-O foliage; although N, was significantly higher in fertilized trees by midsummer. In contrast, fertilization resulted in large increases in L, N-1, and A in F-C1, and F-C2 foliage, increasing A(a) by about 20%. These results suggest that, although both needle age classes accumulate N following fertilization, they use it differently-current-year foliage incorporates N into photosynthetic machinery, whereas 1-year-old foliage serves as an N store. There were no significant interaction effects of elevated [CO2] and fertilization on A. Elevated [CO2] increased the intercept of the A:N-1 relationship but did not significantly affect the slope of the relationship in either foliage age class.

AB Weed risk assessment has become an accepted methodology for examining the likelihood and consequence of a plant species becoming invasive outside of its native range. Weed risk assessment draws upon biological and ecological information to estimate the likelihood and magnitude of the threats posed by introducing non-indigenous plants. In geographical terms, this has traditionally been understood as within a new country following importation of plant material. However, recent risk assessment development has focused more specifically on intracountry risk posed by already-present invasive plants and is referred to as post-border weed risk management. This form of assessment calls for fine-scale predictions of invasive species habitat suitability. This study applies some of the more popular and widely available habitat prediction models that represent a variety of different statistical approaches (linear regression, logistic regression, Bayesian probability, Classification and Regression Trees, Genetic Algorithm for Rule-set Production) to a single invasive plant, the vertebrate-dispersed, fleshy fruited European olive (Olea europaea L.) in southern Australia. The relationships between the dependant (O. europaea distribution) and independent (soil and climate) variables are used in the models to produce predictive maps for each model. Accuracy was calculated for each model output as well as a combined surface to examine whether recent calls for ensemble modelling of distributions produces improved predictions. Overall, the combined prediction demonstrated superior accuracy compared to any individual model outputs. The combined outputs can be likened to mapped gradations of predicted habitat suitability. The type of output produced in this study should form a critical component of post-border weed risk management but more importantly, the methodology will add to this important discipline.

AB It has long been suspected that analysis of correlated amino acid substitutions should uncover pairs or clusters of sites that are spatially proximal in mature protein structures. Accordingly, methods based on different mathematical principles such as information theory, correlation coefficients and maximum likelihood have been developed to identify co-evolving amino acids from multiple sequence alignments. Sets of pairs of sites whose behaviour is identified by these methods as correlated are often significantly enriched in pairs of spatially proximal residues. However, relatively high levels of false-positive predictions typically render such methods, in isolation, of little use in the ab initio prediction of protein structure. Misleading signal (or problems with the estimation of significance levels) can be caused by phylogenetic correlations between homologous sequences and from correlation due to factors other than spatial proximity (for example, correlation of sites which are not spatially close but which are involved in common functional properties of the protein). In recent years, several workers have suggested that information from correlated substitutions should be combined with other sources of information (secondary structure, solvent accessibility, evolutionary rates) in an attempt to reduce the proportion of false-positive predictions. We review methods for the detection of correlated amino acid substitutions, compare their relative performance in contact prediction and predict future directions in the field.

AB In this work, eddy covariance data from a northern boreal Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) stand were used in the parametrization of two up-scaled leaf-level photosynthesis models. The parametrization was carried out by eddy covariance data inversion. The biochemically based Farquhar model parameters, the maximum rate of electron transport (J(max)) and maximum rate of carboxylation [V-c(max)], were both obtained from the temperature responses measured by the eddy covariance. The semi-empirical model, based on optimizing water use and carbon gain, was parametrized according to the seasonal behaviour of the parameter ss. The parametrization of the models was performed for the year 2001, while 2002 was used as a test year to study the models' capabilities. Both of the models tracked daily CO2 assimilation fairly well, reaching the high growing-season rates in mid-June and starting the autumn drawdown at the beginning of September. The incapability of the models to track the diminishing Of CO2 fluxes during very dry days brings up the issue of combining a soil model into the canopy model. The biochemical model parameters have temperature responses that change during the growing season. The biochemical model responds more to the temperature, whereas the semi-empirical model is strongly driven by the light level.

AB 1. The importance of plant-soil interactions in land reclamation, and the management and restoration of functioning native ecosystems, is becoming widely recognized. However, relatively little is known about broad-scale patterns of genetic variation and adaptation in wild plant-soil symbiotic interactions.
   2. The current study is part of a larger project examining patterns of genetic variation and adaptation in host and symbiont populations across their geographical ranges using two widespread native Australian Acacia spp. (A. salicina, A. stenophylla) and associated populations of rhizobial bacteria.
   3. A total of 58 sites were characterized with regard to symbiont population sizes, soil chemistry and environmental parameters. Rhizobial abundance was negatively correlated with a small number of soil factors, including nitrogen, and positively correlated with organic carbon and cation exchange capacity.
   4. There were clear differences between host species in seedling growth responses in glasshouse trials using pots inoculated with native soils. While A. salicina grew equally well with soils from A. stenophylla and A. salicina sites, A. stenophylla grew best when inoculated with its own soils, indicating broad-scale adaptation to its own rhizobia.
   5. Rhizobial abundance in these soils was also strongly correlated to variation in nodulation and host growth, indicating that abundance may be a good indicator of the relative effectiveness of rhizobial populations.
   6. The clear differences in specificity and effectiveness of host-symbiont associations, even among related species, suggests that better knowledge of these systems at multiple spatial scales is central to understanding the factors that influence the ecology and evolution of plant and soil communities, and has potential to increase the cost-effectiveness of restoration programs.

AB Cicadas have been shown to be useful organisms for examining the effects of distribution, plant association and geographical barriers on gene flow between populations. The cicadas of the Platypleura stridula species complex are restricted to the biologically diverse Cape Floristic Region (CFR) of South Africa. They are thus an excellent study group for elucidating the mechanisms by which hemipteran diversity is generated and maintained in the CFR. Phylogeographical analysis of this species complex using mitochondrial DNA Cytochrome Oxidase I (COI) and ribosomal 16S sequence data, coupled with preliminary morphological and acoustic data, resolves six clades, each of which has specific host-plant associations and distinct geographical ranges. The phylogeographical structure implies simultaneous or near-simultaneous radiation events, coupled with shifts in host-plant associations. When calibrated using published COI and 16S substitution rates typical for related insects, these lineages date back to the late Pliocene - early Pleistocene, coincident with vegetation change, altered drainage patterns and accelerated erosion in response to neotectonic crustal uplift and cyclic Pleistocene climate change, and glaciation-associated changes in climate and sea level.

AB Serranids are important components of artisanal and commercial catch worldwide, but are highly susceptible to overfishing. In Pohnpei (Micronesia), a recent coral reef fish market survey revealed a reliance on night-time spearfishing and a serranid catch composed primarily of juveniles and small adults of practically all epinepheline species. Fishing effort was concentrated in one of five municipalities and was disproportionate to the population distribution. Lagoon areas were fished preferentially to outer reef areas, with both catch size distribution and species composition similar between the two areas. Some species were unique to a particular gear type, but catch composition did not vary substantially between spear and line fishing. Existing seasonal sales bans, meant to protect reproductively active serranids, appeared to place additional pressure on other families during ban periods. The study identified the need for a comprehensive management plan that merges traditional measures, including size limits and gear restrictions, with precautionary management tools. Specifically, the scale and scope of marine protected areas should be increased to protect juveniles and other life history stages over wider areas than currently employed.

AB In urban brownfields (derelict sites), we studied the influence of local factors (successional age, vegetation structure, soil) and landscape context (spatial arrangement of brownfields of different successional stages) on the diversity of phytophagous insects, grasshoppers and leafhoppers (Orthoptera and Hemiptera: Auchenorrhyncha). The study was conducted on a total of 246 plots in the cities of Bremen and Berlin, Germany. We used a habitat modelling approach, enabling us to predict the community from single species models (30 species in Bremen, 28 in Berlin).
   The results revealed that communities were predominantly determined by vegetation structure, followed by landscape context, soil parameters and site age. For most species, local factors were the most important. Only few species were strongly influenced by landscape context, even though some showed clear negative reactions to low proportions of brownfields in the surroundings.
   Along a successional gradient of vegetation structure, from scarce and low to dense and high vegetation, the insect community was not static. Even though species numbers remained comparatively constant, species composition changed considerably. Many species showed clear preferences for certain successional stages. Thus, maintaining the regional species pool of a city requires a mosaic of all successional stages.

AB Forest fuel reduction treatments are increasingly used by managers to reduce the risk of high-severity wildfire and to manage changes in the ecological function of forests. However, comparative ecological effects of the various types of treatments are poorly understood. We examined short-term patterns in small-mammal responses to mechanical thinning, prescribed-fire, and mechanical thinning/prescribed-fire combination treatments at eight different study areas across the United States as a part of the National Fire and Fire Surrogate (FFS) Project. Research questions included: (1) do treatments differ in their effect on small mammal densities and biomass? and (2) are effects of treatments consistent across study areas? We modeled taxa-specific densities and total small-mammal biomass as functions of treatment types and study area effects and ranked models based on an information-theoretic model selection criterion. Small-mammal taxa examined, including deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus), yellow-pine chipmunks (Tamias amoenus), and golden-mantled ground squirrels (Spermophilus lateralis), as well as all Peromyscus and Tamias species, had top-ranked models with responses varying both by treatment type and study area. In each of these cases, the top-ranked model carried between 69% and 99% of the total weight in the model set, indicating strong support for the top-ranked models. However, the top-ranked model of total small-mammal biomass was a model with biomass varying only with treatment (i.e., treated vs. untreated), not by treatment type or study area; again, this model had strong support, with 75% of the total model weight. Individual species and taxa appear to have variable responses to fuel reduction treatment types in different areas; however, total small-mammal biomass appears generally to increase after any type of fuel reduction. These results suggest that there is substantial variability in taxa-specific responses to treatments and indicate that adaptive management policies may be necessary when applying fuel reduction treatments in areas where management of small-mammal populations is of interest. Adaptive management can be used by managers who are conducting fuel reduction treatments to reduce uncertainty as to which treatments are locally optimal for meeting objectives for the management of small-mammal populations.

AB We propose a biodiversity credit system for trading endangered species habitat designed to minimize and reverse the negative effects of habitat loss and fragmentation, the leading cause of species endangerment in the United States. Given the increasing demand for land, approaches that explicitly balance economic goals against conservation goals are required. The Endangered Species Act balances these conflicts based on the cost to replace habitat. Conservation banking is a means to manage this balance, and we argue for its use to mitigate the effects of habitat fragmentation. Mitigating the effects of land development on biodiversity requires decisions that recognize regional ecological effects resulting from local economic decisions. We propose Landscape Equivalency Analysis (LEA), a landscape-scale approach similar to HEA, as an accounting system to calculate conservation banking credits so that habitat trades do not exacerbate regional ecological effects of local decisions. Credits purchased by public agencies or NGOs for purposes other than mitigating a take create a net investment in natural capital leading to habitat defragmentation. Credits calculated by LEA use metapopulation genetic theory to estimate sustainability criteria against which all trades are judged. The approach is rooted in well-accepted ecological, evolutionary, and economic theory, which helps compensate for the degree of uncertainty regarding the effects of habitat loss and fragmentation on endangered species. LEA requires application of greater scientific rigor than typically applied to endangered species management on private lands but provides an objective, conceptually sound basis for achieving the often conflicting goals of economic efficiency and long-term ecological sustainability.

AB Aims The aims were (1) to assess the species richness and structure of phytophagous Hemiptera communities along a latitudinal gradient, (2) to identify the importance of rare species in structuring these patterns, and (3) to hypothesize about how phytophagous Hemiptera communities may respond to future climate change.
   Location East coast of Australia.
   Methods Four latitudes within the 1150 km coastal distribution of Acacia falcata were selected. The insect assemblage on the host plant Acacia falcata was sampled seasonally over two years. Congeneric plant species were also sampled at the sites.
   Results Ninety-eight species of phytophagous Hemiptera were collected from A. falcata. Total species richness was significantly lower at the most temperate latitude compared to the three more tropical latitudes. We classified species into four climate change response groups depending on their latitudinal range and apparent host specificity. Pairwise comparisons between groups showed that the cosmopolitan, generalist feeders and specialists had a similar community structure to each other, but the climate generalists had a significantly different structure. Fifty-seven species were identified as rare. Most of these rare species were phloem hoppers and their removal from the dataset led to changes in the proportional representation of all guilds in two groups: the specialist and generalist feeders.
   Main conclusions We found no directional increase in phytophagous Hemiptera species richness. This indicates that, at least in the short term, species richness patterns of these communities may be similar to that found today. As the climate continues to change, however, we might expect some increases in species richness at the more temperate latitudes as species migrate in response to shifting climate zones. In the longer term, more substantial changes in community composition will be expected because the rare species, which comprise a large fraction of these communities, will be vulnerable to both direct climatic changes, and indirect effects via changes to their host's distribution.

AB Studies of domestic animals are performed on breeds, but a breed does not necessarily equate to a genetically defined population. The division of sheep from three native and four modern Baltic sheep breeds was studied using 21 microsatellite loci and applying a Bayesian clustering method. A traditional breed-wise approach was compared to that relying on the pattern of molecular diversity. In this study, a breed was found to be inconsistent with a distinct genetic population for three reasons: (i) a lack of differentiation between modern Baltic breeds, since the majority of the studied sheep formed a single population; (ii) the presence of individuals of foreign ancestry within the breed; and (iii) an undefined local Saaremaa sheep was referred to as a breed, but was shown to consist of separate populations. In the breed-wise approach, only the clearly distinct Ruhnu sheep demonstrated low within-breed variation, although the newly identified Saaremaa populations also have low variability. Providing adequate management recommendations for the Saaremaa sheep is not possible without further studies, but the potential harmful effects of inbreeding in the Ruhnu sheep could be reduced through the use of two genetically related Saaremaa populations. In other breeds, excessive crossing appears to be a larger concern than inbreeding. Assigning individuals into populations based on the pattern of genetic diversity offers potentially unbiased means of elucidating the genetic population structure of species. Combining these genetic populations with phenotypic and aetiological data will enable formulation of the most informed recommendations for gene resource management.

AB Marine sponges are an ecologically important and highly diverse component of marine benthic communities, found in all the world's oceans, at all depths. Although their commercial potential and evolutionary importance is increasingly recognized, many pivotal aspects of their basic biology remain enigmatic. Knowledge of historical biogeographic affinities and biodiversity patterns is rudimentary, and there are still few data about genetic variation among sponge populations and spatial patterns of this variation. Biodiversity analyses of tropical Australasian sponges revealed spatial trends not universally reflected in the distributions of other marine phyla within the Indo-West Pacific region. At smaller spatial scales sponges frequently form heterogeneous, spatially patchy assemblages, with some empirical evidence suggesting that environmental variables such as light and/or turbidity strongly contribute to local distributions. There are no apparent latitudinal diversity gradients at larger spatial scales but stochastic processes, such as changing current patterns, the presence or absence of major carbonate platforms and historical biogeography, may determine modern day distributions. Studies on Caribbean oceanic reefs have revealed similar patterns, only weakly correlated with environmental factors. However, several questions remain where molecular approaches promise great potential, e.g., concerning connectivity and biogeographic relationships. Studies to date have helped to reveal that sponge populations are genetically highly structured and that historical processes might play an important role in determining such structure. Increasingly sophisticated molecular tools are now being applied, with results contributing significantly to a better understanding of poriferan microevolutionary processes and molecular ecology.

AB In order to investigate the mechanisms of maize adaptation to temperate climate, we studied photosynthetic efficiency, as evaluated by means of Phi(PSII) and chloroplast ultrastructure, as well as growth and development of two inbred lines (the chilling-tolerant KW 1074 and the chilling-sensitive CM 109) under laboratory conditions. Plants were grown from seed to the 3rd leaf stage at a suboptimal temperature (14 degreesC/12 degreesC) and then the temperature was increased to 24 degreesC/22 degreesC. To verify the results obtained with the two model tines, twelve inbred lines were tested under both laboratory and field conditions.
   Initial growth at low temperature affected the chloroplast ultrastructure and photosynthetic efficiency, and this was more pronounced in CM 109 than in KW 1074 plants. The differences between the two lines were particularly pronounced in leaf 5. One week after the onset of favourable conditions, mesophyll chloroplast. grana in the CIA 109 line were small. and thylakoids were developed only poorly. Also, thylakoids in bundle sheath chloroplasts were less frequent in CM 109 than in KW 1074. However, two weeks after the temperature increase, the ultrastructure of chloroplasts of the 5th leaf no longer differed distinctly between the two lines. One should note that in both tines, only the 7th and younger leaves reached a chloroplast ultrastructure and Phi(PSII) indistinguishable from those of control plants.
   In general, the recovery of photosynthetic efficiency followed the development of leaves. It was delayed in the CM 109 more than in the KW 1074 inbred tine relative to control plants grown continuously at the optimal temperature. The growth difference of 2-3 days between the two tines persisted even after the growth temperature was elevated. This suggested that the primary factor responsible for the different chilling-sensitivities of the two model lines was leaf development and the differences in development of the photosynthetic apparatus had only a secondary role. The delay in leaf development appeared as early as the stage of the 1st leaf. The same delay was observed when only the shoot apex was cooled. The importance for further recovery of the early stages of morphogenesis was confirmed by a correlation of laboratory and field data that were obtained using a set of 12 inbred lines. Our results suggest that early stages of shoot morphogenesis determine the duration of the vegetative phase in cool regions, since the delay in growth at a tow temperature cannot be compensated for during later growth at a higher temperature.

AB Few studies have described the spatial patterns of rocky sublittoral benthic communities in Brazil, where these habitats are almost exclusively located on the southeast and south coastline. The fauna and flora were analyzed using a quadrat method, and the species abundance and distribution were determined along transects down to the bottom sand plain on 10 rocky shores at Armacao dos Buzios, Brazil. The 16 most common species accounted for around 97% of the benthos coverage and included cnidarians, algae, poriferans, and echinoderms. Cnidarians and algae were the most important groups, with abundance ranging from 13-66% and 27-68%, respectively. The species distribution indicated a clear depth zonation pattern. The algal community dominated the shallowest depths in sites more exposed to waves and steeper substrate slope, whereas the cnidarian community, divided into the zoanthidean Palythoa caribaeorum and the coral Siderastrea stellata, was more abundant from intermediate to greater (4 m) depths. Different community patterns were found between sites, demonstrating that different spatially discrete factors may be acting on each rocky shore.

AB We present six new small subunit (SSU) ribosomal DNA sequences from the heterotrophic flagellate genera Cercomonas, Heteromita, and Thaumatonionas. We aligned the sequences against 42 SSU rDNA sequences from GenBank, including organisms which previously have been demonstrated to group with Cercomonas, Heteromita, and Thaumatomonas and some additional outgroup taxa. The ribosomal secondary structure was taken into account when aligning the sequences. To compensate for unequal evolutionary rates, we subjected 1959 homologue positions (including gaps) to the process of "substitution rate calibration", resulting in a reduced dataset of evolutionarily informative positions (979 bp). We analysed the data by three different algorithms: neighbour-joining, parsimony, and maximum likelihood. The three algorithms all supported monophyly of a clade consisting of Cercomonas, Heteromita, and Thaumatomonas, chlorarachniophytes, the haplosporids, the plasmodiophorids, the euglyphids, Massisteria and Cryothecomonas. Likewise, the three algorithms strongly supported the separation of Cercomonas into two clades. Hence we suggest that some of the members of the present genus Cercomonas should be placed in a new genus Neocercomonas gen. nov. (C) 2004 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB Orissa, on the east coast of India, is one of the three mass nesting sites in the world for olive ridley turtles (Lepidochelys olivacea). This population is currently under threat as a result of fishery-related mortality; more than 100 000 olive ridleys have been counted dead in the last 10 years in Orissa. In general, the globally distributed olive ridley turtle has received significantly less conservation attention than its congener, the Kemp's ridley turtle (L. kempi), because the latter is recognized as a distinct species consisting of a single endangered population. Our study of mitochondrial DNA haplotypes suggests that the ridley population on the east coast of India is panmictic, but distinct from all other populations including Sri Lanka. About 96% of the Indian population consisted of a distinct 'K' clade with haplotypes not found in any other population. Nested clade analysis and conventional analysis both supported range expansions and/or long-distance colonization from the Indian Ocean clades to other oceanic basins, which suggested that these are the ancestral source for contemporary global populations of olive ridley turtles. These data support the distinctiveness of the Indian Ocean ridleys, suggesting that conservation prioritization should be based on appropriate data and not solely on species designations.

AB Biodiversity is a valuable, but poorly understood, natural resource, which is being lost at an accelerating rate as a result of human actions. We present a broad, introductory review of biodiversity concepts. Biodiversity is first defined at the species and community levels. Available methods and approaches for quantifying biodiversity are discussed with specific reference to the spatial scales over which these measures can be applied. Dominant threats to biodiversity are reviewed. Fundamental patterns and processes that underlie ecological production functions are outlined. Differing rationales for biodiversity conservation are given and compared. Finally, the Current suite of approaches employed in biodiversity conservation is discussed. Our aim in writing this review is to encourage further, much needed, inter-disciplinary collaboration among economists and ecologists on biodiversity questions. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

AB Phylogenetic relationships among 8 species of white-toothed shrews (Crocidurinae, Mammalia) in East and Central Asia were evaluated based on mitochondrial cytochrome-b gene sequences. The taxon formerly regarded as Crocidura suaveolens in East Asia phylogenetically is distinct from that of true C. suaveolens in Europe, suggesting that specimens in East Asia should be considered a distinct species, C. shantungensis. All shrews from Central Asia were regarded as C. sibirica, although phylogenetic comparison with the unsampled C. gmelini is needed to confirm its taxonomic status. C. shantungensis, C. suaveolens, and C. sibirica formed a well-supported monophyletic group. C. dsinezumi, C. lasiura, C. kurodai, and C. watasei also formed a well-supported monophyletic group. Within C. dsinezumi, there were 2 clusters, referable to western and eastern Japan. Based on low genetic divergence, C. dsinezumi on Cheju and Hokkaido islands appear to be the result of a recent introduction from western Japan and northern-eastern Honshu, respectively.

DT Article
AB Biological reserves are set aside to conserve species in dynamic, human-dominated landscapes; however, most reserve systems protect only small, potentially biased samples of environmental conditions across the range of individual species or habitat types. Such biases can result in counter-intuitive distributions of environmental conditions under combinations of climate change and habitat loss. This study outlines the potential range of interactions and presents a case study investigating vernal pool wetlands in California, USA. The results indicate that future distributions of environmental conditions will be determined as much by land-use decisions as by atmospheric emissions.

AB Overexploitation and habitat degradation threaten small-scale, artisanal fisheries around the world. Management of these fisheries is often inadequate or absent, partly because they are data poor. We here present the development of management options for such a fishery, using collaborative input from a variety of interested groups. Qualitative and semi-quantitative assessments of seahorse populations in central Philippines suggest that they are overfished. Management objectives focus on rebuilding seahorse stocks, maintaining income for fishers and ensuring long-term persistence of seahorse populations. We developed a list of 11 management options at a workshop of fisheries experts from a variety of backgrounds. We then undertook an iterative process of consultation involving fishers, traders, consumers, conservationists, aquarists, national and international policy groups. The creation of no-take Marine Protected Areas and minimum size limits for seahorses were strongly supported by all groups, emerging as the preferred options. Tenure over marine estate was strongly supported but may prove difficult to implement in the Philippines. Sex-selective fishing (leaving pregnant males) had moderate support across all groups but may be relatively easy to introduce because of fisher acceptance. In collaboration with international efforts to ensure sustainable trade in seahorses we recommend that a minimum size limit of 10 cm height and more no-take Marine Protected Areas be implemented as soon as possible to help restore this seahorse fishery in the Philippines.

AB Homoplasy among morphological characters has hindered inference of higher level rodent phylogeny for over 100 years. Initial molecular studies, based primarily on single genes, likewise produced little resolution of the deep relationships among rodent families. Two recent molecular studies (Huchon et al., 2002, Mol. Biol. Evol. 19: 1053-1065; Adkins et al., 2003, Mol. Phylogenet. Evol. 26: 409-420), using larger samples from the nuclear genome, have produced phylogenies that are generally concordant with each other, but many of the deep superfamilial nodes were still lacking substantial statistical support. Data are presented here for a total of approximately 3,600 base pairs from portions of three different nuclear protein-coding genes, CB1, IRBP, and RAG2, from 19 rodents and three outgroups. Separate analyses, with data partitioned according to both genes and codon position, produced conflicting results. Trees obtained from all partitions of CB1 and RAG2 and those obtained from the first-plus second-position sites of IRBP were generally concordant with each other and the trees from the two recent studies, whereas trees obtained from the third-position sites of IRBP were not. Although the IRBP third-position sites represent only 1/9 of the total data set, combined analyses using either parsimony or likelihood resulted in trees in agreement with the IRBP third-position sites and in disagreement with the remaining 8/9 of the sites from this data set and the two recent multigene studies. In contrast, maximum-likelihood analysis using a site-specific rates model did recover a tree that is highly congruent with the trees in the two recent studies. If the IRBP third-position sites are removed from the current data set, then combined likelihood analyses obtain a tree that is highly congruent with those of the two recent studies. This analysis also provides, for the first time in a study of rodent phylogeny, robust statistical support for every bipartition, with just one exception. This tree divides rodents into two major clades. The first contains Myodonta (Muroidea plus Dipodidae) and the only unresolved trichotomy, from which descend Geomyoidea, Pedetidae, and Castoridae. On the other side of the root is a clade containing Sciuroidea plus Gliridae, and Hystricognathi. Some uncertainty remains on the placement of the root. Trees on which the Hystricognathi are the basal sister group to Myodonta, Geomyoidea, Pedetidae, and Castoridae are also found within a Bayesian 95% credible set, as estimated by Metropolis-coupled Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling.

AB Genetic variability is one of the major survival strategies developed by symbiotic fungi. We focused on the ectomycorrhizal fungus Tuber uncinatum Chatin that produces edible ascomata. In order to understand the degree of its variability and its relatedness to another morphologically-similar truffle, T. aestivum Vittad., ascomata of T. uncinatum were collected from a single natural truffle-ground located in the north of Italy and compared with samples from other Italian sites, as well as with T. aestivum ascomata from other European regions.
   We used multi-locus approaches, such as microsatellite-primed PCR (polymerase chain reaction), and single locus markers, such as mitochondrial and nuclear ribosomal DNA on 30 samples. The results demonstrate that the level of genetic polymorphism among isolates of T. uncinatum was higher than in other Tuber species, like T. melanosporum . Neighbour-joining analyses were carried out on a binary data matrix on 12 ascomata of T. uncinatum and T. aestivum, and on 15 internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences of these species and 5 from other Tuber species. Taken together, they clustered T. uncinatum and T. aestivum in two separate groups. The mitochondrial rDNA primers, NMS1 and NMS2, were not able to differentiate morphologically related and unrelated truffles. Moreover, a pair of primers, intentionally designed to differentiate isolates of T. aestivum and T. uncinatum from other Tuber species, successfully amplified DNA from all the samples of T. aestivum and T. uncinatum considered in our analysis. In conclusion, different molecular approaches separate T. aestivum and T. uncinatum according to their spore reticulum and their taste and smell.

AB For 3 years aspects of the population dynamics, growth, and bioactivity (measure of biologically active metabolite biosynthesis) of the Demospongiae Latrunculia sp. nov. and Polymastia croceus (Kelly-Borges & Bergquist) were examined on a subtidal reef on the Wellington south coast, New Zealand. For both species, survival of adult sponges was high in all seasons, whereas juvenile sponges had poor survival. Recruitment of Latrunculia sp. nov. occurred in all seasons indicating that this species is reproductively active throughout the year. P. croceus recruited mostly in autumn, supporting previous work that found the sponge to be reproductively active in summer and early autumn only. For both sponge species, growth rates varied greatly between individuals and were unaffected by initial sponge size within the range examined. Sponges generally grew during winter and spring as the water temperature rose, and shrank during summer and autumn as the water temperature fell. This growth pattern may relate to seasonal variation in food abundance, and for P. croceus it may result also from seasonal differences in reproductive investment. After 2 years, Latrunculia sp. nov. and P. croceus had on average, halved and doubled in size, respectively. Latrunculia sp. nov. showed a seasonal pattern of bioactivity, being most active in spring possibly to prevent the surface overgrowth of fouling organisms. P. croceus had no seasonal pattern of bioactivity, but individuals were either very active or inactive. The bioactive metabolites in both species possibly aid in competitive interactions and prevent predation and biofouling.

AB The ability to link breeding and wintering sites of declining or threatened species is fundamental to their effective conservation, but previous conventional methods such as banding have proved largely unsuccessful at the population level, New approaches to tracking migratory birds in North America, using stable isotope measurements of feathers, can assist in determining where feathers were grown and, hence, the origins of migrants on wintering grounds or stopover sites. Moreover, this approach is applicable to the use of metabolically inactive tissues of migratory animals other than birds. Here, we demonstrate how stable isotopes can be used to investigate the origins of a wintering population of a threatened species. The Loggerhead Shrike (Lanius ludovicianus) is declining throughout most of its range, but various factors may operate on different subpopulations. We used the stable-carbon (delta C-13) and hydrogen (deltaD) isotope values in the outer tail feather of Loggerhead Shrikes wintering in Texas (n = 70), Florida (n = 121), and Georgia (n = 24) in 1997-1998, and northern Mexico (n = 72) in 1999, in order to ascertain the minimum percentage of wintering birds that were northern migrants. For comparative purposes, we also measured stable isotopic compositions of feathers from nestling shrikes from Manitoba (n = 6) and from known resident shrikes from Texas (n = 16). As expected, shrikes from Manitoba were more depleted in deuterium than shrikes from Texas, providing a clear isotopic gradient with which to compare the wintering population structure. Of wintering shrikes in Florida, similar to 10% were northern migrants, compared with 8% for the Mexican sample and only 4% of the Texas population. We detected no northern migrants in the Georgia population. Most U.S. wintering shrikes had deltaD values around -30 parts per thousand, indicative of southern latitudes. but a broader range in deltaD values was found for shrikes in northern Mexico. Shrikes wintering in Mexico may be composed largely of individuals originating from the eastern Rockies and central regions of the breeding range. The considerable variation in delta C-13 values indicated a broad range of C-3- to C-4-based food webs used by shrikes. Our study indicates that the stable isotopic technique answers a number of longstanding and fundamental questions concerning the breeding or natal origins of wintering populations of Loggerhead Shrikes and thereby provides a template for isotopic approaches to ecological investigations of other migratory species.

AB Large-scale biodiversity assessment of faunal distribution is needed in poorly sampled areas. In this paper, Scarabaeinae dung beetle species richness in Portugal is forecasted from a model built with a data set from areas identified as well sampled. Generalized linear models are used to relate the number of Scarabaeinae species in each Portuguese UTM 50 x 50 grid square with a set of 25 predictor variables (geographic, topographic, climatic and land cover) extracted from a geographic information system (GIS). Between-squares sampling effort unevenness, spatial autocorrelation of environmental data, non-linear relationships between variables and an assessment of the models' predictive power, the main shortcomings in geographic species richness modelling, are addressed. This methodological approach has proved to be reliable and accurate enough in estimating species richness distribution, thus providing a tool to identify areas as potential targets for conservation policies in poorly inventoried countries.

AB The effects of different intensities and durations of soil drought and re-watering on the nitrate uptake ability of maize roots were studied. Plants were grown in split-root containers with one part of the root system subjected to different intensities and durations of soil drought and re-watering while the other part of the root system was continuously watered to 23% (w/w) soil water content (70% water capacity). Experiments were performed in split-root containers to maintain a high growth rate, thus ensuring high nutrient demand of the shoot irrespective of the soil water regime. To avoid limitation of nitrate uptake by transport processes in the dry soil, and to ensure a uniform N-14/N-15 ratio at the root surface, N-15 was applied to the roots by placing them into an aerated nutrient solution with 0.5 mM Ca((NO3)-N-15)(2). Shoot elongation and biomass were only slightly affected by drought in one root compartment when the soil in the other root compartment was kept wet. Therefore, the growth-related nutrient demand of the shoot remained at a high level. At moderate levels of soil drought (10% w/w water content) the ability of the roots for N-uptake was not affected even after 10 d of drought. N-uptake ability was reduced to about 20% of the well-watered control only when the soil water content was decreased to 5%. Total soluble sugar content of the roots increased with increasing soil drought, indicating that low N-uptake ability of roots subjected to severe soil drought was not caused by low assimilate supply from the shoot. Nitrate uptake ability of roots maintained in very dry soil (5% soil water content w/w) even for a prolonged period of 8 d, recovered within 3 d following re-watering. Root growth increased one day after re-watering. A short-term experiment with excised roots formerly subjected to severe soil drought showed that nitrate uptake ability recovered in old and young root segments after 2 d of re-watering. Obviously, the increase in N-uptake ability after re-watering was caused not only by new root growth but also by recovery of the uptake ability of formerly stressed roots.

AB The literature on environmental effects on dry matter partitioning in higher plants, in particular crop plants, is reviewed focussing on changes in shoot to root dry weight ratio (S:R). Of particular consistency is the finding that S:R increases with increased nitrogen (N) supply. Relations between nitrogen (N) supply, growth, S:R and tissue N and protein concentration are examined. In some cases, the increase in S:R with increased N supply is likely to have been at leaf in part an effect on growth and development, but there is unequivocal evidence that N affects S:R independently of growth and development. A positive correlation between S:R and leaf protein concentration is highlighted. It is argued that the N effect on S:R outside the effect on growth and development is related to increased shoot protein concentration. Specifically, shoot and root growth are colimited by local carbon (C) and N (primarily protein) substrate concentrations and shoot growth will increase relative to root growth with increased N substrate availability due to the proximity of the shoot to the C source. It is further argued that results in the literature are consistent with the proposal that macronutrient, water, irradiance, CO2 and temperature effects on S:R are often primarily mediated through their effects on growth and development, and shoot protein concentration and hence shoot growth.

AB Carefully collected molecular data and rigorous analyses are revolutionizing today's phylogenetic studies. Although molecular data have been used to estimate various invertebrate phylogenies for more than a decade, this study is the first survey of different regions of mitochondrial DNA in isopod crustaceans assessing sequence divergence and hence the usefulness of these regions to infer phylogeny at different hierarchical levels. I evaluate three loci from the mitochondrial genome (two ribosomal RNAs (12S, 16S) and one protein-coding (COI)) for their appropriateness in inferring isopod phylogeny at the suborder level and below. The patterns are similar for all three loci with the most speciose suborders of isopods also having the most divergent mitochondrial nucleotide sequences. Recommendations for designing an order- or suborder-level molecular study in previously unstudied groups of Crustacea would include: (I) collecting a minimum of two-four species or genera thought to be most divergent, (2) sampling across the group of interest as equally as possible in terms of taxonomic representation and the distribution of species, (3) surveying several genes, and (4) carrying out preliminary alignments, checking data for nucleotide bias, transition/transversion ratios, and saturation levels before committing to a large-scale sequencing effort.

AB DNA sequence variation at the hypervariable 5' end of the mitochondrial control region was examined in 247 individuals to detect genetic divergence among 14 populations of red grouse (Lagopus lagopus scoticus) in northeastern Scotland. Ten haplotypes were resolved, several of which were shared among populations. Analysis of molecular variance, Nei's gamma(ST), and a cladistic estimate of the amount of gene flow indicated a lack of overall population differentiation. Patterns of overall panmixia are in stark contrast to previous reports of localized subdivision among the same set of populations detected using hypervariable microsatellite markers. Because grouse cocks are territorial and show extreme natal philopatry and females are the dispersing sex, such discordance could be explained by sex-biased dispersal, with extensive female-mediated gene flow preventing mitochondrial DNA divergence. However, it is difficult to reconcile how effective dispersal of females would not homogenize both mitochondrial and nuclear structure simultaneously. We use a model that examines the spatial and temporal dynamics of diparentally and uniparentally inherited genes to show that, under realistic ecological scenarios and with specitic differences in the dispersal of males and females, the local effective size of the nuclear genome can be less than that of the mitochondrial and the patterns of structuring we observe are meaningful.

AB In this paper, we present a variability map of the eukaryotic large subunit ribosomal RNA, showing the distribution of variable and conserved sites in this molecule. The variability of each site in this map is indicated by means of a colored dot. Construction of the variability map was based on the substitution rate calibration (SRC) method, in which the substitution rate of each nucleotide site is computed by looking at the frequency with which sequence pairs differ at that site as a function of their evolutionary distance. Variability maps constructed by this method provide a much more accurate acid objective description of site-to-site variability than visual inspection of sequence alignments.

AB Bull trout, Salvelinus confluentus (Salmonidae), are distributed in northwestern North America from Nevada to Yukon Territory, largely in interior drainages. The species is of conservation concern owing to declines in abundance, particularly in southern portions of its range. To investigate phylogenetic structure within bull trout that might form the basis for the delineation of major conservation units, we conducted a mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) survey in bull trout from throughout its range. Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of four segments of the mtDNA genome with 11 restriction enzymes resolved 21 composite haplotypes that differed by an average of 0.5% in sequence. One group of haplotypes predominated in 'coastal' areas (west of the coastal mountain ranges) while another predominated in 'interior' regions (east of the coastal mountains). The two putative lineages differed by 0.8% in sequence and were also resolved by sequencing a portion of the ND1 gene in a representative of each RFLP haplotype. Significant variation existed within individual sample sites (12% of total variation) and among sites within major geographical regions (33%), but most variation (55%) was associated with differences between coastal and interior regions. We concluded that: (i) bull trout are subdivided into coastal and interior lineages; (ii) this subdivision reflects recent historical isolation in two refugia south of the Cordilleran ice sheet during the Pleistocene: the Chehalis and Columbia refugia; and (iii) most of the molecular variation resides at the interpopulation and infer-region levels. Conservation efforts, therefore, should focus on maintaining as many populations as possible across as many geographical regions as possible within both coastal and interior lineages.

AB 1, The photosynthetic response to elevated CO2 and nutrient stress was investigated in Agrostis capillaris, Lolium perenne and Trifolium repens grown in an open-top chamber facility for 2 years under two nutrient regimes. Acclimation was evaluated by measuring the response of light-saturated photosynthesis to changes in the substomatal CO2 concentration.
   2. Growth at elevated CO2 resulted in reductions in apparent Rubisco activity in vivo in all three species, which were associated with reductions of total leaf nitrogen content on a unit area basis for A. capillaris and L. perenne. Despite this acclimation, photosynthesis was significantly higher at elevated CO2 for T. repens and A. capillaris, the latter exhibiting the greatest increase of carbon uptake at the lowest nutrient supply.
   3. The photosynthetic nitrogen-use efficiency (the rate of carbon assimilation per unit leaf nitrogen) increased at elevated CO2, Mot purely owing to higher values of photosynthesis at elevated CO2, but also as a result of lower leaf nitrogen contents.
   4. Contrary to most previous studies, this investigation indicates that elevated CO2 can stimulate photosynthesis under a severely limited nutrient supply. Changes in photosynthetic nitrogen-use efficiency may be a critical determinant of competition within low nutrient ecosystems and low input agricultural systems.

AB We tested the hypothesis that, in tropical pioneer tree species, vertical leaf angle contributes to high carbon gain because it minimizes damage caused by high irradiances. Diurnal changes in leaf gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence were measured in east-facing (EL), west-facing (WL) leaves, and in leaves artificially held horizontal (HL) in the uppermost canopy of Macaranga conifera (Zoll.) Muell. Arg. Maximum values of net photosynthetic rate (P-n) for EL and HL reached 12 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), whereas maximum P-n for WL was only 6 mu mol m(-2) s(-1). Midday depressions of P-n and stomatal conductance occurred at high photosynthetic photon flux densities (PPFD), especially for HL, Photosystem IT quantum yield (Delta F/F-m') of HL for a given PPFD at the leaf surface was lower in the afternoon than in the morning. Values of Delta F/F-m' for HL measured at dusk were lower than those measured just before dawn, suggesting that HL suffered from high light and heat load. Variations in the morphology and physiology of the canopy leaves were associated with different light environments, and there was circumstantial evidence of a transitional point at a PPFD of about 20-30% of full sunlight. Maximum P-n and nitrogen (N) content were higher in upper canopy leaves than in lower canopy leaves, and the differences were mainly associated with differences in lamina thickness. We conclude that the vertical leaf angle and thick lamina of the top canopy leaves contributed to enhance total carbon gain of the whole plant.

AB Determining evolutionarily significant units in endangered species is one of the most significant challenges facing conservation biology Often genetic information has been used as the primary basis of recommendations for evolutionarily significant units, but these data should be evaluated carefully and used in conjunction with other information. The endangered Gila topminnow (Poeciliopsis. o. occidentalis) has been the subject of extensive conservation biology research and genetic investigation. We extended these data to highly variable genetic markers, examined variation in microsatellite loci, and compared it with previous measures of genetic diversity for the Gila topminnow from the four watersheds in Arizona in which they are still naturally extant. Fish from Monkey Spring were the most highly differentiated from the other populations. Overall, the amounts and patterns of genetic variation were consistent with known historical and physical differences among sites. the four watersheds are highly physically isolated from one another and differ in a number of important factors in their physical habitat biota, and the life-history of the topminnows. Based on these geographic patterns and the genetic results, we recommend that the four watersheds all be managed and conserved separately.

AB Variable internal plant nutrient content may confound plant response to environmental stress. Plant nutrient content may be controlled with relative addition rate techniques in solution culture. However, because raising large numbers of plants in flowing solution culture is difficult, we investigated the feasibility of raising plants in soil mix using relative fertilizer additions. Aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) clones (216, 259 and 271) planted in pots containing a peat, sand and vermiculite (2:1:1, v/v/v) soil mix were grown with exponentially increasing fertilizer concentrations and harvested periodically to assess growth. Addition rate treatments ranged from 0.01 to 0.05 day(-1). The lag phase of growth, in which plants adjusted to the fertilizer regime, lasted 40 days after which plants entered the experimental period characterized by constant relative growth rates equivalent to applied fertilizer addition rates. Total plant nutrient concentration was (1) unique for each addition rate, (2) linearly related to addition rate and growth rate, and (3) tended to increase at the highest, and decrease at the lowest addition rates. Regardless, the plants appeared to have attained steady-stale conditions. Allocation of carbon to roots increased with lower addition rate treatments and was not dependent upon ontogeny. There were no treatment differences in growth response among aspen clones. Yet there were treatment differences in leaf chlorophyll and photosynthesis within the clones. For the 0.05 day(-1) addition rate treatment, chlorophyll, leaf N concentration and photosynthetic rate were strongly correlated with one another, were at a maximum in recently mature leaves, and rapidly declined with leaf age. The rate of decline in these leaf characteristics was slowest in clone 271, consistent with the leaf longevity stress response reported elsewhere. Plant responses from these relative fertilizer addition trials in soil mix agree closely with those run in hydroponics, indicating that steady-state nutrition can be achieved with a technically simple experimental assemblage.

AB Allozyme electrophoresis was used to examine genetic diversity within live-bearing Peripatopsid Onychophora from the North Island of New Zealand. Specimens of two previously described morpho-species that differ in leg number (Peripatoides suteri and P novaezealandiae) were found to be genetically diverse. P. suteri showed little intraspecific genetic variation but were very distinct from specimens assignable to II novaezealandiae. Within P. novaezealandiae five genetically differentiated species were identified although none showed any consistent morphological differentiation, thus P. novaezealandiae (Hutton) is a species complex. All of these species occur in sympatry or parapatry (in one instance) with other cryptic species of the P. novaezealandiae group or with P suteri. Four new species are described on the basis of this genetic evidence; they are P. morgani, P. aurorbis, P. kawekaensis and P. sympatrica. Other genotypes encountered indicate further cryptic species remain unrecognized. Among the North Island species, P. suteri and P. aurorbis sp. nov. are both more closely related to undescribed species from the South Island than to others examined from the North Island. P. sympatrica sp. nov. exists in sympatry with at least three other species in different parts of its range. The complexity of relationships and distributions probably arose through the interaction of low vagility in peripatus and the active geophysical history of the region. How these cryptic species persist in sympatry is not known but may be linked to differences in ecology not evident in their morphology, and/or may indicate recent dispersal from allopatry.

AB Sequence variation at a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) gene, assumed to be involved in parasite and pathogen resistance, was examined in the endangered Gila topminnow (Poeciliopis o. occidentalis), from the four watersheds where they remain in the United States. This is the first estimate of variation in MHC genes in natural populations of an endangered species. The population that has experienced the most bottlenecks historically was monomorphic for MHC variation. Another population, which earlier had been found to be the only population polymorphic for allozymes, had five MHC alleles, four different from those found in the other populations. Overall, nine different alleles were found. The four populations were highly divergent at MHC with four of the six population pairs not sharing any alleles. However, the magnitude of differentiation between populations on the amino-acid level varied fivefold for the populations that shared no alleles. Using single-stranded conformational polymorphism (SSCP), these alleles segregated consistently with Mendelian expectations in families. Because of the high genetic differentiation between these populations for a potentially adaptive gene, we recommend that the four watersheds be examined further for separate conservation and management.

AB The principal objective of this study was to describe the pattern of genetic exchange and isolation of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) populations among geographical regions of the province of Quebec, Canada. Seven riverine populations, associated with three putative regional metapopulations (North Share, Gaspe Peninsula, and Ungava), were analyzed using microsatellites. Our results did not support the putative metapopulation structure. Significant heterogeneity in allelic frequency was observed among most rivers independently of their location or group subdivision. Interpopulation genetic variance (phi(ST)) indicates less heterogeneity among rivers than chi(2) analysis and was mainly associated with the geographical distance of the most isolated rivers, the Natashquan and the Koksoak. Even with low genetic variance among populations, the overall significant allelic heterogeneity among rivers strongly suggests that each population, whether separated by thousands or tens of kilometres, should be considered and managed as a specific stock.

AB 1. The geographical aspects in photosynthetic light response and stomatal conductance in the shoots of Pious sylvestris were studied together with structural properties of shoots and needles. Seven stands within the natural distribution area of P. sylvestris in Europe were chosen. CO2 exchange, irradiance and stomatal conductance (g(s)) for water vapour were measured and the maximum photosynthetic rate (P-m) was determined from the CO2 exchange measurements.
   2. There was a clear pattern in the average values of P-m along the latitudinal gradient. Highest values of P-m were found in the middle parts of the distribution area and they decreased towards both ends of the transect. The highest value was almost twice as high as the lowest one.
   3. The between-site variation explained 70% of the total variation in the maximum photosynthetic rate. P-m was not clearly correlated with any single climatic variable or nitrogen concentration in the needles.
   4. P-m was closely coupled with stomatal conductance (r(2)=0.74). The differences in P-m and g(s) between the sites is likely to reflect adaptation and acclimation to different climates.

AB Recruitment and population density of coral reef fishes were studied on artificial and natural reefs on the west coast of Barbados. Recruitment of all species combined and of 3 common species (Thalassoma bifasciatum, Stegastes partitus and Halichoeres garnoti) occurred mostly from May to November. Recruitment rate varied little across reef types and reef locations. Population density of all species combined and of the 3 common species varied little throughout the year, but did vary across reefs and locations. The observation that patterns of seasonal and spatial variation in densities did not reflect the patterns of seasonal and spatial variation in recruitment suggests that reef fish populations in Barbados may be primarily regulated by post-settlement events. Recruitment of all species combined and of the 3 common species was not affected by the density of all species combined. No evidence could be found for interspecific competition, i.e. a negative relationship between the density of one species and the recruitment of another. However, recruitment of H. garnoti was inhibited on some reefs by high densities of conspecifics. Post-recruitment mortality of all species combined was not affected by density of all species. However, post-recruitment mortality of T. bifasciatum and S. partitus was higher on reefs of higher conspecific density. These results provide evidence for the regulation of reef fish populations in Barbados by post-settlement processes, and suggest that intraspecific interactions may be particularly important in limiting population size.

AB In vegetative canopies of many species, the vertical gradient of lamina nitrogen concentration (NW) parallels the profile of light distribution in such a way that the actual nitrogen partitioning approaches the optimum pattern for canopy photosynthesis. This paper evaluates the hypothesis that a strong sink for nitrogen, viz. growing grain, affects the pattern of lamina nitrogen distribution usually described for vegetative canopies. The light and NW profiles of sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) crops were characterised from anthesis to physiological maturity. The factorial combination of two plant populations (2.4 and 4.8 plants M-2) and two levels of nitrogen supply (0 and 5 g N m-2) were the sources of variation for NW and light profiles. Before the onset of nitrogen accumulation in grain, the pattern of NW was similar to that described for other species and it was related to the distribution of light in the canopy. Important changes in the profile of NW occurred during grain filling that were unrelated to the light regime. Nitrogen was mobilised from leaves in all positions in the canopy and the rate of NW change was greater in leaves closer to the grain, which were also the leaves where nitrogen was more concentrated. It is concluded that the physiological mechanisms involved in determining the distribution of leaf nitrogen in vegetative canopies do not apply to sunflower during grain filling.

   MORTALITY; POPULATIONS; LARVAE; DAMSELFISH; STRATEGIES; SETTLEMENT
AB It is generally accepted that the intensity of recruitment of pelagic young of temperate marine fishes is determined primarily by events that affect young as larvae, and that pelagic processes substantially increase variation in recruitment over the level expected from variation in spawning output alone. Spawning and recruitment of 6 species of Caribbean damselfishes were monitored monthly at a site in Panama for 1 to 3 yr (1983 to 1987) and 7 to 10 yr (1980 to 1989), respectively. Intermensual variation in recruitment strength exceeded corresponding variation in spawning output by average factors of at least 1.5 to 3.0 (and perhaps as much as 4 to 20) among those species. Serial changes in seasonally-adjusted monthly spawning output and 'resultant' recruitment strength were not correlated in any species. Thus, regardless of whether or not local populations are self-recruiting, pelagic processes evidently do largely control, and substantially enhance, short-term variability in recruitment strength in these fishes. Interannual variation in recruitment was low in all but one species, in which it also exceeded variation in spawning. Thus control of variation in recruitment strength by short-term pelagic processes had little or no net effect on interannual variation in recruitment in most cases. Interspecific differences in recruitment seasonality and in levels of variation in mensual and annual recruitment strength (but not mensual and annual spawning output) indicate that pelagic processes affect recruitment of some of these closely related species to different degrees and in different temporal patterns.

AB Transparent plastic minirhizotron tubes have been used to evaluate spatial and temporal growth activities of plant root systems. Root number was estimated from video recordings of roots intersecting minirhizotron tubes and of washed roots extracted from monoliths of the same soil profiles at the physiological maturity stage of a maize (Zea mays L.) crop Root length was measured by the line intercept (LI) and computer image processing (CIP) methods from the monolith samples.
   There was a slight significant correlation (r = 0.28, p < 0.005) between the number of roots measured by minirhizotron and root lengths measured by the LI method, however, no correlation was found with the CIP method. Using a single regression line, root number WaS underestimated by the minirhizotron method at depths between 0-7.6 cm. A correlation was found between root length estimated by LI and CIP. The slope of estimated RLD was significant with depth for these two methods. Root length density (RLD) measured by CIP showed a more erratic decline with distance from the plant row and soil surface than the LI method.

AB We conducted a field experiment to assess interrelationships between leaf-tissue secondary chemistry, avian predation, and the abundance and diversity of arthropods occurring on sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata) in central Oregon. Arthropods were removed from individual shrubs, some of which were then caged to exclude birds. Secondary chemistry and arthropods were sampled at intervals up to 56 wk following the defaunation/caging treatment.
   Recovery rates differed among arthropod taxa and functional groups. Several sap-sucking homopterans and hemipterans reached control levels within 2-4 wk of the treatment, whereas abundances of parasitoids and predators recovered to match control numbers only 6 wk after defaunation. Abundances of several herbivorous leaf-chewing taxa (primarily lepidopteran larvae) remained significantly depressed even 56 wk after the treatment. Fungivores (oribatid mites) reached greater abundances on defaunated than on control shrubs by the end of the experiment. There were also significant changes in the concentrations or frequency of occurrence of several chemical compounds following the defaunation treatment. Several hydrocarbons, sesquiterpenes, and monoterpenes that were present in most shrubs exhibited sharply reduced concentrations in leaf tissues within 4 wk of the treatment, whereas some alcohols and ketones (linalool, borneol, thujone), which occurred at relatively low frequencies among control plants, increased dramatically in their frequencies of occurrence following arthropod removal. Both changes persisted for the duration of the experiment. We found several significant associations between the abundance or occurrence of arthropod taxa or groups and concentrations or frequencies of secondary compounds, but these were most prevalent among the leaf-chewing lepidopterans. We suggest that the shrubs responded to the removal of herbivorous, leaf-chewing arthropods by altering chemical allocation patterns; the changes in chemistry persisted for over a year because recolonization of the defaunated plants by these herbivores was slow.
   Effects of the caging treatment were much less obvious. The recovery of the diversity of arthropods known to constitute prey for birds in this system was slower on shrubs protected from avian predation than on exposed shrubs, but a year after defaunation diversity had increased to higher levels on the protected shrubs. Few arthropod taxa or functional groups differed in abundance or frequency of occurrence between caged and uncaged shrubs, although fungivores (which are not eaten by birds) increased to levels on protected shrubs that were nearly twice those on the uncaged controls by the end of the experiment. Between-shrub variance in the abundance and diversity of bird-prey taxa was greater among exposed than protected shrubs, possibly reflecting the effects of area-restricted searching by the birds. There were no differences in leaf-tissue secondary chemistry between caged and uncaged shrubs.

AB The unprecedented rate of extinction calls for efficient use of genetics to help conserve biodiversity. Several recent genomic and simulation-based studies have argued that the field of conservation biology has placed too much focus on conserving genome-wide genetic variation, and that the field should instead focus on managing the subset of functional genetic variation that is thought to affect fitness. Here, we critically evaluate the feasibility and likely benefits of this approach in conservation. We find that population genetics theory and empirical results show that conserving genome-wide genetic variation is generally the best approach to prevent inbreeding depression and loss of adaptive potential from driving populations toward extinction. Focusing conservation efforts on presumably functional genetic variation will only be feasible occasionally, often misleading, and counterproductive when prioritized over genome-wide genetic variation. Given the increasing rate of habitat loss and other environmental changes, failure to recognize the detrimental effects of lost genome-wide genetic variation on long-term population viability will only worsen the biodiversity crisis.

AB This study analyzes the relationship between globalization, energy consumption, and economic growth among selected South Asian countries. This study also finds causal association between energy growth and nexus of CO2 emissions, and employed the premises of the EKC framework. The study used annual time series analysis, starting from 1972 to 2017. The data set has been collected from the world development indicator (WDI). The result of a fully modified ordinary least square (FMOLS) method describes a significantly worsen the quality environment in the south Asian region. The individual country as Bangladesh shows a positively significant impact on the CO2 emissions and destroying the level of environment regarding non-renewable energy and globalization index. However, negative and positive growth level (GDP) and square of GDP confirm the EKC hypothesis in this region. This study has identified the causality between GDP growth and carbon emission and found bidirectional causality between economic growth and energy use.

AB Functional traits are frequently used to evaluate plant adaptation across environments. Yet, traits tend to have multiple functions and interactions, which cannot be accounted for in traditional correlation analyses. Plant trait networks (PTNs) clarify complex relationships among traits, enable the calculation of metrics for the topology of trait coordination and the importance of given traits in PTNs, and how they shift across communities. Recent studies of PTNs provide new insights into some important topics, including trait dimensionality, trait spectra (including the leaf economic spectrum), stoichiometric principles, and the variation of phenotypic integration along gradients of resource availability. PTNs provide improved resolution of the multiple dimensions of plant adaptation across scales and responses to shifting resources, disturbance regimes, and global change.

AB Motivation Trait data are fundamental to the quantitative description of plant form and function. Although root traits capture key dimensions related to plant responses to changing environmental conditions and effects on ecosystem processes, they have rarely been included in large-scale comparative studies and global models. For instance, root traits remain absent from nearly all studies that define the global spectrum of plant form and function. Thus, to overcome conceptual and methodological roadblocks preventing a widespread integration of root trait data into large-scale analyses we created the Global Root Trait (GRooT) Database. GRooT provides ready-to-use data by combining the expertise of root ecologists with data mobilization and curation. Specifically, we (a) determined a set of core root traits relevant to the description of plant form and function based on an assessment by experts, (b) maximized species coverage through data standardization within and among traits, and (c) implemented data quality checks. Main types of variables contained GRooT contains 114,222 trait records on 38 continuous root traits. Spatial location and grain Global coverage with data from arid, continental, polar, temperate and tropical biomes. Data on root traits were derived from experimental studies and field studies. Time period and grain Data were recorded between 1911 and 2019. Major taxa and level of measurement GRooT includes root trait data for which taxonomic information is available. Trait records vary in their taxonomic resolution, with subspecies or varieties being the highest and genera the lowest taxonomic resolution available. It contains information for 184 subspecies or varieties, 6,214 species, 1,967 genera and 254 families. Owing to variation in data sources, trait records in the database include both individual observations and mean values. Software format GRooT includes two csv files. A GitHub repository contains the csv files and a script in R to query the database.

AB Understanding and predicting biological invasions is challenging because of the complexity of many interacting players. A holistic approach is needed with the potential to simultaneously consider all relevant effects and effectors. Using networks to describe the relevant anthropogenic and ecological factors, from community-level to global scales, promises advances in understanding aspects of invasion from propagule pressure, through establishment, spread, and ecological impact of invaders. These insights could lead to development of new tools for prevention and management of invasions that are based on species' network characteristics and use of networks to predict the ecological effects of invaders. Here, we review the findings from network ecology that show the most promise for invasion biology and identify pressing needs for future research.

AB Understanding how introduced species succeed and become widely distributed within non-native areas is critical to reduce the threats posed by them. Our goal was to reconstruct the main invasion routes and invasion dynamics of a global freshwater invader, the red swamp crayfish, Procambarus clarkii, through the analysis of its genetic variability in both native and invasive ranges. We inferred invasion routes and population structure from the analysis of a fragment (608 base pairs) of the mitochondrial marker cytochrome c oxidase subunit I from 1,062 individuals of P. clarkii in addition to 354 GenBank sequences, for a total of 122 populations (22 natives and 100 invaded). Genetic structure was assessed using analysis of molecular variance and non-metric multidimensional scaling analyses. We analysed haplotype frequencies for the genetic variability in each locality and region. The haplotype network was depicted by using PopART software. A high haplotype diversity was found in the native range (haplotype diversity [Hd]: 0.90), but also in some non-native areas, such as western U.S.A. (Hd: 0.80), areas of Mexico (Hd: 0.78), and some hotspots in Europe (e.g. southern Spain or Italy), suggesting a complex pattern of multiple introductions. We grouped all localities in five differentiated groups according to biogeographic origin: the native area, west Americas, east U.S.A., Asia, and Europe. Additionally, the identification of 15 haplotypes shared between at least two localities, the phylogenetic network estimation and indices of genetic differentiation among localities allowed us to identify a large genetic admixture in the native range; the two independent invasion routes (i.e. westwards and eastwards) in U.S.A. from the native range (Louisiana and Texas) with translocations within each area; a stepping-stone introduction from U.S.A. to Japan (involving few individuals) themselves introduced to China afterwards; the entry of P. clarkii from Louisiana (U.S.A.) into southern Spain and their multiple secondary introductions over Europe as well as other possible introductions in central Europe. Our study emphasises the need for unravelling the global invasion routes and the demographic processes underlying the introduction of exotic species (i.e. admixture, bridgehead invasion effect, and propagule pressure) to control the spread of invasive species. Our findings highlight the value of genetic analyses to identify the geographic origin of source populations as well as the variability of invaded areas in order to reconstruct invasion dynamics and facilitate management of invasive species (e.g. through environmental DNA monitoring).

AB The vast majority of measurements in the field of plant hydraulics have been on small-diameter branches from woody species. These measurements have provided considerable insight into plant functioning, but our understanding of plant physiology and ecology would benefit from a broader view, because branch hydraulic properties are influenced by many factors. Here, we discuss the influence that other components of the hydraulic network have on branch vulnerability to embolism propagation. We also modelled the impact of changes in the ratio of root-to-leaf areas and soil texture on vulnerability to hydraulic failure along the soil-to-leaf continuum and showed that hydraulic function is better maintained through changes in root vulnerability and root-to-leaf area ratio than in branch vulnerability. Differences among species in the stringency with which they regulate leaf water potential and in reliance on stored water to buffer changes in water potential also affect the need to construct embolism resistant branches. Many approaches, such as measurements on fine roots, small individuals, combining sap flow and psychrometry techniques, and modelling efforts, could vastly improve our understanding of whole-plant hydraulic functioning. A better understanding of how traits are coordinated across the whole plant will improve predictions for plant function under future climate conditions.

AB Anthropogenic activities have caused profound changes globally in biodiversity, species interactions and ecosystem functions and services. In terrestrial systems, restoration has emerged as a useful approach to mitigate these changes, and is increasingly recognised as a tool to fortify ecosystems against future disturbances. In marine systems, restoration is also gaining traction as a management tool, but it is still comparatively scant and underdeveloped relative to terrestrial environments. Key coastal habitats, such as seaweed forests and seagrass meadows are showing widespread patterns of decline around the world. As these important ecosystems increasingly become the target of emerging marine restoration campaigns, it is important not only to address current environmental degradation issues, but also to focus on the future. Given the rate at which marine and other environments are changing, and given predicted increases in the frequency and magnitude of multiple stressors, we argue for an urgent need for subtidal marine macrophyte restoration efforts that explicitly incorporate future-proofing in their goals. Here we highlight emerging scientific techniques that can help achieve this, and discuss changes to managerial, political and public frameworks that are needed to support scientific innovation and restoration applications at scale.

AB Upland buzzard (Buteo hemilasius), Saker falcon (Falco cherrug), and Himalayan vulture (Gyps himalayensis) are three common large raptors in the Sanjiangyuan National Park (SNP), China's first national park. Among them, Upland buzzard and Saker falcon play a significant role in controlling plateau rodent populations and reducing the transmission of pathogens carried by rodents. The Himalayan vulture can provide services for the redistribution and recycling of nutrients in the ecosystem, and play an irreplaceable role in the celestial burial culture of Tibetans in China. Exploring their habitat suitability is important for the protection of the three raptors. Our research was based on the current distribution of Upland buzzard, Saker falcon, and Himalayan vulture that we had extensively surveyed in the Sanjiangyuan National Park from 2016 to 2017. Combined with the correlation analysis of environmental variables, we utilized maximum entropy model (MaxEnt) to evaluate and compare the habitat suitability of the three species in the Sanjiangyuan National Park. Elevation, climate, and human disturbance factors, which had direct or indirect effects on species survival and reproduction, were all included in the model. Among them, elevation was the most important environmental variables affecting the suitability of habitats of three species. Temperature-related factor was another important predictor. The high (>60%) suitable habitat areas for Upland buzzard, Saker falcon, and Himalayan vulture were 73,017.63, 40,732.78, and 61,654.33 km(2), respectively, accounted for 59.32%, 33.09%, and 50.08% of the Sanjiangyuan National Park and their total suitable area (i.e., the sum area of high and moderate habitats) reached 96.07%, 60.59%, and 93.70%, respectively. Besides, the three species have overlapping areas for the suitable habitats, which means that overlapping areas should be highly valued and protected. Therefore, understanding the distribution of suitable habitats of the three raptors can provide useful information and reasonable reference for us to put forward suggestions for their protection and regional management.

AB Competition plays a central role in the maintenance of biodiversity. A backbone of classic niche theory is that local coexistence of competitors is favoured by the contraction or divergence of species' niches. However, this effect should depend on the diversity of resources available in the local environment, particularly when resources vary in multiple ecological dimensions. Here, we investigated how available resource breadth (i.e. prey diversity) and competition together shape multidimensional niche variation (between and within individuals) and interspecific niche overlap in 42 populations of congeneric tropical frog species. We modelled realized niches in two key trophic dimensions (prey size and carbon stable isotopes) and sampled available food resources to quantify two-dimensional resource breadth. We found a 14-fold variation in multidimensional population niche width across populations, most of which was accounted for by within-individual diet variation. This striking variation was predicted by an interaction whereby individual niche breadth increased with resource breadth and decreased with the number of congeneric competitors. These ecological gradients also interact to influence the degree of niche overlap between species, which surprisingly decreased with population total niche width, providing novel insights on how similar species can coexist in local communities. Together, our results emphasize that patterns of exploitation of resources in multiple dimensions are driven by both competitive interactions and extrinsic factors such as local resource breadth.

AB Obtaining reliable species observations is of great importance in animal ecology and wildlife conservation. An increasing number of studies use camera traps (CTs) to study wildlife communities, and an increasing effort is made to make better use and reuse of the large amounts of data that are produced. It is in these circumstances that it becomes paramount to correct for the species- and study-specific variation in imperfect detection within CTs. We reviewed the literature and used our own experience to compile a list of factors that affect CT detection of animals. We did this within a conceptual framework of six distinct scales separating out the influences of (a) animal characteristics, (b) CT specifications, (c) CT set-up protocols, and (d) environmental variables. We identified 40 factors that can potentially influence the detection of animals by CTs at these six scales. Many of these factors were related to only a few overarching parameters. Most of the animal characteristics scale with body mass and diet type, and most environmental characteristics differ with season or latitude such that remote sensing products like NDVI could be used as a proxy index to capture this variation. Factors that influence detection at the microsite and camera scales are probably the most important in determining CT detection of animals. The type of study and specific research question will determine which factors should be corrected. Corrections can be done by directly adjusting the CT metric of interest or by using covariates in a statistical framework. Our conceptual framework can be used to design better CT studies and help when analyzing CT data. Furthermore, it provides an overview of which factors should be reported in CT studies to make them repeatable, comparable, and their data reusable. This should greatly improve the possibilities for global scale analyses of (reused) CT data.

AB Human-induced environmental change and habitat fragmentation pose major threats to biodiversity and require active conservation efforts to mitigate their consequences. Genetic rescue through translocation and the introduction of variation into imperiled populations has been argued as a powerful means to preserve, or even increase, the genetic diversity and evolutionary potential of endangered species [1-4]. However, factors such as outbreeding depression [5, 6] and a reduction in available genetic diversity render the success of such approaches uncertain. An improved evaluation of the consequence of genetic restoration requires knowledge of temporal changes to genetic diversity before and after the advent of management programs. To provide such information, a growing number of studies have included small numbers of genomic loci extracted from historic and even ancient specimens [7, 8]. We extend this approach to its natural conclusion, by characterizing the complete genomic sequences of modern and historic population samples of the crested ibis (Nipponia nippon), an endangered bird that is perhaps the most successful example of how conservation effort has brought a species back from the brink of extinc-tion. Though its once tiny population has today recovered to >2,000 individuals [9], this process was accompanied by almost half of ancestral loss of genetic variation and high deleterious mutation load. We furthermore show how genetic drift coupled to inbreeding following the population bottleneck has largely purged the ancient polymor-phisms from the current population. In conclusion, we demonstrate the unique promise of exploiting genomic information held within museum samples for conservation and ecological research.

AB Aim To investigate how the potential bias from isolation by distance (IBD) in inferences of population structure has been addressed, in studies aiming biodiversity conservation. Location Methods Global. We reviewed the literature on the impact of IBD on the performance of the widely used software structure. We also performed a literature survey in the Web of Knowledge to assess how data have been analysed in biodiversity conservation studies when IBD is detected. Results Main conclusions By reviewing the literature on structure performance in IBD data sets, we found a high number of studies showing that structure outputs are extremely affected by IBD. This misleading inference results principally in the detection of artificial genetic clusters. The literature survey showed that IBD was present in most data sets (60.56%) and that a substantial number of the articles only tested IBD by Mantel tests (82.21%). The most concerning result is that several articles have been using structure even after detecting IBD (57.99%), and a substantial number of them are drawing formal conservation strategies, notwithstanding the potentially biased results (51.49%). Our results are of great concern, as conservation strategies may be distinct under different population structure, and its success can be affected by the incorrect identification of populations. We recommend possible stages to be considered in the presence of IBD, which can help conservation investigators before the proposition of explicit conservation strategies.

AB Aim: Accurate predictions of cetacean distributions are essential to their conservation but are limited by statistical challenges and a paucity of data. This study aimed at comparing the capacity of various statistical algorithms to deal with biases commonly found in nonsystematic cetacean surveys and to evaluate the potential for citizen science data to improve habitat modelling and predictions. An endangered population of humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) in their breeding ground was used as a case study.
   Location: New Caledonia, Oceania.
   Methods: Five statistical algorithms were used to model the habitat preferences of humpback whales from 1,360 sightings collected over 14 years of nonsystematic research surveys. Three different background sampling approaches were tested when developing models from 625 crowdsourced sightings to assess methods accounting for citizen science spatial sampling bias. Model evaluation was conducted through cross-validation and prediction to an independent satellite tracking dataset.
   Results: Algorithms differed in complexity of the environmental relationships modelled, ecological interpretability and transferability. While parameter tuning had a great effect on model performances, GLMs generally had low predictive performance, SVMs were particularly hard to interpret, and BRTs had high descriptive power but showed signs of overfitting. MAXENT and especially GAMs provided a valuable complexity trade-off, accurate predictions and were ecologically intelligible. Models showed that humpback whales favoured cool (22-23 degrees C) and shallow waters (0-100 m deep) in coastal as well as offshore areas. Citizen science models converged with research survey models, specifically when accounting for spatial sampling bias.
   Main conclusions: Marine megafauna distribution models present specific challenges that may be addressed through integrative evaluation, independent testing and appropriately tuned statistical algorithms. Specifically, controlling overfitting is a priority when predicting cetacean distributions for large-scale conservation perspectives. Citizen science data appear to be a powerful tool to describe cetacean habitat.

AB Socio-ecological systems maintain reciprocal interactions between biophysical and socioeconomic structures. As a result of these interactions key essential services for society emerge. Urban expansion is a direct driver of land change and cause serious shifts in socio-ecological relationships and the associated lifestyles. The framework of rural-urban gradients has proved to be a powerful tool for ecological research about urban influences on ecosystems and on sociological issues related to social welfare. However, to date there has not been an attempt to achieve a classification of municipalities in rural-urban gradients based on socio-ecological interactions. In this paper, we developed a methodological approach that allows identifying and classifying a set of socio-ecological network configurations in the Region of Madrid, a highly dynamic cultural landscape considered one of the European hotspots in urban development. According to their socio-ecological links, the integrated model detects four groups of municipalities, ordered along a rural-urban gradient, characterized by their degree of biophysical and socioeconomic coupling and different indicators of landscape structure and social welfare. We propose the developed model as a useful tool to improve environmental management schemes and land planning from a socio-ecological perspective, especially in territories subject to intense urban transformations and loss of rurality.

AB Plant and animal diversity generally increases with increasing environmental heterogeneity. Here, we test whether this relationship also holds for bacterial communities in soil. Specifically, we investigate whether invasive annual grasslands have reduced soil heterogeneity and, thereby, decreased bacterial alpha- and beta-diversity. Soils were sampled at nine sites within a 5-km stretch of Southern California, at five depths in three habitats, including non-native invasive annual grassland, native oak woodland, and native coastal sage scrub. We characterized soil heterogeneity as well as bacterial alpha- and beta-diversity by 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing. We found that invasive annual grasslands harbored less soil heterogeneity and reduced bacterial alpha-diversity relative to the two native woody habitats. Further, across all habitats and depths, bacterial alpha- and beta-diversity was positively related to soil heterogeneity. These results suggest that plant invasions associated with soil homogenization may lead to reduced microbial diversity.

AB Severe drought has the potential to cause selective mortality within a forest, thereby inducing shifts in forest species composition. The southern Sierra Nevada foothills and mountains of California have experienced extensive forest dieback due to drought stress and insect outbreak. We used high-fidelity imaging spectroscopy (HiFIS) and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) from the Carnegie Airborne Observatory (CAO) to estimate the effect of forest dieback on species composition in response to drought stress in Sequoia National Park. Our aims were (1) to quantify site-specific conditions that mediate tree mortality along an elevation gradient in the southern Sierra Nevada Mountains, (2) to assess where mortality events have a greater probability of occurring, and (3) to estimate which tree species have a greater likelihood of mortality along the elevation gradient. A series of statistical models were generated to classify species composition and identify tree mortality, and the influences of different environmental factors were spatially quantified and analyzed to assess where mortality events have a greater likelihood of occurring. A higher probability of mortality was observed in the lower portion of the elevation gradient, on southwest-and west-facing slopes, in areas with shallow soils, on shallower slopes, and at greater distances from water. All of these factors are related to site water balance throughout the landscape. Our results also suggest that mortality is species-specific along the elevation gradient, mainly affecting Pinus ponderosa and Pinus lambertiana at lower elevations. Selective mortality within the forest may drive long-term shifts in community composition along the elevation gradient.

AB River systems have critical roles in the natural water environment and the transportation of nutrients. Anthropogenic activities, including wastewater discharge and river damming, raise adverse impacts on ecosystem and continuum of rivers. An increasing amount of attention has been paid to riverine bacterioplankton as they make vital contributions to biogeochemical nutrient cycle. A comprehensive study was conducted on the bacterioplankton community along the Yarlung Tsangpo River, which is the longest plateau river in China and is suffering from various anthropogenic impacts. The results indicated that nutrient variations corresponded to anthropogenic activities, and silica, nitrogen and phosphorus were retained by the dam. River damming influenced the biomass and diversity of the bacterioplankton, but significant alterations in the community structure were not observed between upstream and downstream of the dam. Moreover, the spatial distribution of the bacterioplankton community changed gradually along the river, and the dominant bacterioplankton in the upstream, midstream and downstream portions of the river were Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria, respectively. Soluble reactive phosphorus, elevation, ammonium nitrogen, velocity and turbidity were the main environmental factors that shape the bacterioplankton community. Our study offers the first insights into the variation of a bacterioplankton community of a large river in plateau region.

AB Considerable uncertainty surrounds the impacts of anthropogenic climate change on the composition and structure of Amazon forests. Building upon results from two large-scale ecosystem drought experiments in the eastern Brazilian Amazon that observed increases in mortality rates among some tree species but not others, in this study we investigate the physiological traits underpinning these differential demographic responses. Xylem pressure at 50% conductivity (xylem-P-50), leaf turgor loss point (TLP), cellular osmotic potential (pi(o)), and cellular bulk modulus of elasticity (epsilon), all traits mechanistically linked to drought tolerance, were measured on upper canopy branches and leaves of mature trees from selected species growing at the two drought experiment sites. Each species was placed a priori into one of four plant functional type (PFT) categories: drought-tolerant versus drought-intolerant based on observed mortality rates, and subdivided into early-versus late-successional based on wood density. We tested the hypotheses that the measured traits would be significantly different between the four PFTs and that they would be spatially conserved across the two experimental sites. Xylem-P-50, TLP, and pi(o), but not epsilon, occurred at significantly higher water potentials for the drought-intolerant PFT compared to the drought-tolerant PFT; however, there were no significant differences between the early-and late-successional PFTs. These results suggest that these three traits are important for determining drought tolerance, and are largely independent of wood density-a trait commonly associated with successional status. Differences in these physiological traits that occurred between the drought-tolerant and drought-intolerant PFTs were conserved between the two research sites, even though they had different soil types and dry-season lengths. This more detailed understanding of how xylem and leaf hydraulic traits vary between co-occuring drought-tolerant and drought-intolerant tropical tree species promises to facilitate a much-needed improvement in the representation of plant hydraulics within terrestrial ecosystem and biosphere models, which will enhance our ability to make robust predictions of how future changes in climate will affect tropical forests.

AB In seasonally dry tropical forest regions, drought avoidance during the dry season coupled with high assimilation rates in the wet season is hypothesized to be an advantageous strategy for forest trees in regions with severe and long dry seasons. In contrast, where dry seasons are milder, drought tolerance coupled with a conservative resource-use strategy is expected to maximize carbon assimilation throughout the year. Tests of this hypothesis, particularly at the intraspecific level, have been seldom conducted. In this study, we tested the extent to which drought resistance mechanisms and rates of carbon assimilation have evolved under climates with varying dry season length and severity within Quercus oleoides Cham. and Schlect., a tropical dry forest species that is widely distributed in Central America. For this purpose, we conducted a greenhouse experiment where seedlings originating from five populations that vary in rainfall patterns were grown under different watering treatments. Our results revealed that populations from xeric climates with more severe dry seasons exhibited large mesophyllous leaves (with high specific leaf area, SLA), and leaf abscission in response to drought, consistent with a drought- avoidance strategy. In contrast, populations from more mesic climates with less severe dry seasons had small and thick sclerophyllous leaves with low SLA and reduced water potential at the turgor loss point (ptlp), consistent with a drought- tolerance strategy. Mesic populations also showed high plasticity in ptlp in response to water availability, indicating that osmotic adjustment to drought is an important component of this strategy. However, populations with mesophyllous leaves did not have higher maximum carbon assimilation rates under well- watered conditions. Furthermore, SLA was negatively associated with mass- based photosynthetic rates, contrary to expectations of the leaf economics spectrum, indicating that drought- resistance strategies are not necessarily tightly coupled with resource- use strategies. Overall, our study demonstrates the importance of considering intraspecific variation in analyses of the vulnerability of tropical trees to climate change.

AB Background: Taxonomy offers precise species identification and delimitation and thus provides basic information for biological research, e.g. through assessment of species richness. The importance of molecular taxonomy, i.e., the identification and delimitation of taxa based on molecular markers, has increased in the past decade. Recently developed exploratory tools now allow estimating species-level diversity in multi-locus molecular datasets.
   Results: Here we use molecular species delimitation tools that either quantify differences in intra- and interspecific variability of loci, or divergence times within and between species, or perform coalescent species tree inference to estimate species-level entities in molecular genetic datasets. We benchmark results from these methods against 14 morphologically readily differentiable species of a well-defined subgroup of the diverse Drusinae subfamily (Trichoptera, Limnephilidae). Using a 3798 bp (6 loci) molecular data set we aim to corroborate a geographically isolated new species by integrating comparative morphological studies and molecular taxonomy.
   Conclusions: Our results indicate that only multi-locus species delimitation provides taxonomically relevant information. The data further corroborate the new species Drusus zivici sp. nov. We provide differential diagnostic characters and describe the male, female and larva of this new species and discuss diversity patterns of Drusinae in the Balkans. We further discuss potential and significance of molecular species delimitation. Finally we argue that enhancing collaborative integrative taxonomy will accelerate assessment of global diversity and completion of reference libraries for applied fields, e.g., conservation and biomonitoring.

AB Xylella fastidiosa is an important plant pathogen that attacks several plants of economic importance. Once restricted to the Americas, the bacterium, which causes olive quick decline syndrome, was discovered near Lecce, Italy in 2013. Since the initial outbreak, it has invaded 23,000 ha of olives in the Apulian Region, southern Italy, and is of great concern throughout Mediterranean basin. Therefore, predicting its spread and estimating the efficacy of control are of utmost importance. As data on this invasive infectious disease are poor, we have developed a spatially-explicit simulation model for X. fastidiosa to provide guidance for predicting spread in the early stages of invasion and inform management strategies. The model qualitatively and quantitatively predicts the patterns of spread. We model control zones currently employed in Apulia, showing that increasing buffer widths decrease infection risk beyond the control zone, but this may not halt the spread completely due to stochastic long-distance jumps caused by vector dispersal. Therefore, management practices should aim to reduce vector long-distance dispersal. We find optimal control scenarios that minimise control effort while reducing X. fastidiosa spread maximally-suggesting that increasing buffer zone widths should be favoured over surveillance efforts as control budgets increase. Our model highlights the importance of non-olive hosts which increase the spread rate of the disease and may lead to an order of magnitude increase in risk. Many aspects of X. fastidiosa disease invasion remain uncertain and hinder forecasting; we recommend future studies investigating quantification of the infection growth rate, and short and long distance dispersal.

AB Succulent plants are iconic components of the florae of many terrestrial ecosystems, but despite having caused fascination and prompted investigation for centuries, they still harbour many secrets in terms of physiological function and evolution. Tackling these mysteries is important, as this will not only provide insights into the dynamics and details of the convergent evolution of a major adaptive syndrome, but also inform efforts to conserve endangered biodiversity and utilize the unique physiological characteristics of succulents for biofuel and biomass production. Here I review advances in the phylogeny and organismal biology of succulent plants, and discuss how insights from recent work in the wider fields of plant hydraulics and photosynthetic physiology may relate to succulents. The potential for the exploration of mechanistic relationships between anatomical structure and physiological function to improve our understanding of the constraints that have shaped the evolution of succulence is highlighted. Finally, attention is drawn to how new methodologies and technologies provide exciting opportunities to address the wide range of outstanding questions in succulent plant biology.

AB Bycatch is a common occurrence in heavily fished areas such as the Fraser River, British Columbia, where fisheries target returning adult Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) en route to spawning grounds. The extent to which these encounters reduce fish survival through injury and physiological impairment depends on multiple factors including capture severity, river temperature and infectious agents. In an effort to characterize the mechanisms of post-release mortality and address fishery and managerial concerns regarding specific regulations, wild-caught Early Stuart sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) were exposed to either mild (20 s) or severe (20 min) gillnet entanglement and then held at ecologically relevant temperatures throughout their period of river migration (mid-late July) and spawning (early August). Individuals were biopsy sampled immediately after entanglement and at death to measure indicators of stress and immunity, and the infection intensity of 44 potential pathogens. Biopsy alone increased mortality (males: 33%, females: 60%) when compared with nonbiopsied controls (males: 7%, females: 15%), indicating high sensitivity to any handling during river migration, especially among females. Mortality did not occur until 5-10 days after entanglement, with severe entanglement resulting in the greatest mortality (males: 62%, females: 90%), followed by mild entanglement (males: 44%, females: 70%). Infection intensities of Flavobacterium psychrophilum and Ceratonova shasta measured at death were greater in fish that died sooner. Physiological indicators of host stress and immunity also differed depending on longevity, and indicated anaerobic metabolism, osmoregulatory failure and altered immune gene regulation in premature mortalities. Together, these results implicate latent effects of entanglement, especially among females, resulting in mortality days or weeks after release. Although any entanglement is potentially detrimental, reducing entanglement durations can improve post-release survival.

AB The involvement of ecological theory in habitat restoration has significantly increased in the past decade. However, despite the fact that the field of restoration ecology has grown academically strong in recent years, there are still visible gaps between the advancing discipline of theoretical ecology and current approaches of habitat restoration. We propose bridging these gaps by linking recent developments in theoretical plant ecology with the main questions every restoration practitioner should ask, namely: Q1) How to identify target species and baseline conditions for restoration of the selected habitat?; Q2) When can one count on spontaneous dispersal and when are additional efforts required for facilitating dispersal of desired species?; Q3) Which factors determine the successful establishment of target species and assembly of target communities?; and Q4) What time-scale needs to be considered for the evaluation of species colonisation and restoration success? Knowledge and experience accumulated in practical restoration can considerably benefit theoretical ecology for example by improving the understanding on (i) temporal changes in community, (ii) species assembly, (iii) species dispersal and establishment and (iv) landscape-scale dynamics of biodiversity. We emphasise that to improve joint thinking of practical restoration and theoretical ecology, restoration-problem-driven theoretical research is necessary. We suggest either (i) to translate and link the current findings of theoretical ecology to restoration strategies; and/or (ii) to summarise practical restoration needs by formulation of questions and testable hypotheses based on theory.

AB Nitrogen content per unit leaf area (N-area) is a key variable in plant functional ecology and biogeochemistry. Narea comprises a structural component, which scales with leaf mass per area (LMA), and a metabolic component, which scales with Rubisco capacity. The co-ordination hypothesis, as implemented in LPJ and related global vegetation models, predicts that Rubisco capacity should be directly proportional to irradiance but should decrease with increases in c(i) : c(a) and temperature because the amount of Rubisco required to achieve a given assimilation rate declines with increases in both. We tested these predictions using LMA, leaf delta C-13, and leaf N measurements on complete species assemblages sampled at sites on a north-south transect from tropical to temperate Australia. Partial effects of mean canopy irradiance, mean annual temperature, and c(i) : c(a) (from delta C-13) on N-area were all significant and their directions and magnitudes were in line with predictions. Over 80% of the variance in community-mean (ln) N-area was accounted for by these predictors plus LMA. Moreover, N-area could be decomposed into two components, one proportional to LMA slightly steeper in N-fixers), and the other to Rubisco capacity as predicted by the co-ordination hypothesis. Trait gradient analysis revealed c(i) : c(a) to be perfectly plastic, while species turnover contributed about half the variation in LMA and N-area.
   Interest has surged in methods to predict continuous leaftrait variation from environmental factors, in order to improve ecosystem models. Coupled carbon-nitrogen models require a method to predict Narea that is more realistic than the widespread assumptions that Narea is proportional to photosynthetic capacity, and/or that Narea (and photosynthetic capacity) are determined by N supply from the soil. Our results indicate that Narea has a useful degree of predictability, from a combination of LMA and c(i) : c(a)-themselves in part environmentally determined-with Rubisco activity, as predicted from local growing conditions. This finding is consistent with a "plant-centred" approach to modelling, emphasizing the adaptive regulation of traits. Models that account for biodiversity will also need to partition community-level trait variation into components due to phenotypic plasticity and/or genotypic differentiation within species vs. progressive species replacement, along environmental gradients. Our analysis suggests that variation in Narea is about evenly split between these two modes.

AB El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is the main mode controlling the variability in the ocean-atmosphere system in the South Pacific. While the ENSO influence on rainfall regimes in the South Pacific is well documented, its role in driving spatiotemporal trends in fire activity in this region has not been rigorously investigated. This is particularly the case for the highly flammable and densely populated southeast Australian sector, where ENSO is a major control over climatic variability. Here we conduct the first region-wide analysis of how ENSO controls fire activity in southeast Australia. We identify a significant relationship between ENSO and both fire frequency and area burnt. Critically, wavelet analyses reveal that despite substantial temporal variability in the ENSO system, ENSO exerts a persistent and significant influence on southeast Australian fire activity. Our analysis has direct application for developing robust predictive capacity for the increasingly important efforts at fire management.

AB Theory predicts that sexual reproduction is difficult to maintain if asexuality is an option, yet sex is very common. To understand why, it is important to pay attention to repeatably occurring conditions that favour transitions to, or persistence of, asexuality. Geographic parthenogenesis is a term that has been applied to describe a large variety of patterns where sexual and related asexual forms differ in their geographic distribution. Often asexuality is stated to occur in a habitat that is, in some sense, marginal, but the interpretation differs across studies: parthenogens might not only predominate near the margin of the sexuals' distribution, but might also extend far beyond the sexual range; they may be disproportionately found in newly colonizable areas (e.g. areas previously glaciated), or in habitats where abiotic selection pressures are relatively stronger than biotic ones (e.g. cold, dry). Here, we review the various patterns proposed in the literature, the hypotheses put forward to explain them, and the assumptions they rely on. Surprisingly, few mathematical models consider geographic parthenogenesis as their focal question, but all models for the evolution of sex could be evaluated in this framework if the (often ecological) causal factors vary predictably with geography. We also recommend broadening the taxa studied beyond the traditional favourites.
   This article is part of the themed issue 'Weird sex: the underappreciated diversity of sexual reproduction'.

AB 1. The functional structure of plant communities can be altered by grazing through two main mechanisms: species turnover (i.e. changes in species occurrence and relative abundance) and intraspecific trait variability (ITV), which is driven by phenotypic responses of individual plants and shifts in the relative abundance of genotypic variants within species. Studies of grassland ecosystem function under grazing often focus on community changes induced by species turnover, which ignores the effects of ITV on biomass productivity, soil carbon or nutrient availability. By quantifying the relative contribution of both effects on shifts in community -wide traits, we highlight the role of ITV in community functional response to grazing and its implications for ecosystem function in Tibetan alpine meadows.
   2. We measured three chemical traits (LC: leaf carbon, LN: leaf nitrogen and LP: leaf phosphorus concentrations) and two morphological traits (SLA: specific leaf area, LDMC: leaf dry matter content) that are critical components of plant production and forage quality in grazed and ungrazed plots. Using variance decomposition of community-weighted means (CWM) for these foliar traits, we distinguished the relative importance of ITV vs. change in species occurrence and abundance in response to grazing and the associated changes in soil carbon and nutrient availability.
   3. The CWM for foliar nutrients and SLA(CWM) increased in response to grazing together with decreases in soil carbon and nutrient stores, especially LPCWM enrichment and loss of available soil P. The LPCWM was strongly negatively correlated with LDMCCWM, which was significantly higher in ungrazed plots. These community-wide trait responses to grazing were generally best captured by ITV and not changes in species occurrence and abundance, although ITV was consistently correlated with species turnover for all traits.
   4. Synthesis and applications. In response to continuous grazing, plants in Tibetan alpine meadows increase specific leaf area and foliar nutrients but tend to have lower leaf dry matter content, a response consistent with faster growth and regrowth under grazing. This intraspecific trait variability response drives a shift in community function from conservative, slow-growing resource use in ungrazed meadows to exploitative resource use under grazing. This community-wide functional response enhances forage quality, in turn favouring the secondary productivity of small herbivorous mammal communities, but also contributes to accelerated depletion of soil available phosphorus. We discuss the implications of these results for biodiversity conservation, ecosystem function and rangeland sustainability in the Qinghai Tibetan Plateau, especially with regard to managing grazing rotation to strike a balance between favouring secondary productivity of domesticated stock vs. small herbivorous mammals

AB Water relations represent a pivotal nexus in plant biology due to the multiplicity of functions affected by water status. Hydraulic properties of plant parts are therefore likely to be relevant to evolutionary trends in many taxa. Bromeliaceae encompass a wealth of morphological, physiological and ecological variations and the geographical and bioclimatic range of the family is also extensive. The diversification of bromeliad lineages is known to be correlated with the origins of a suite of key innovations, many of which relate directly or indirectly to water relations. However, little information is known regarding the role of change in morphoanatomical and hydraulic traits in the evolutionary origins of the classical ecophysiological functional types in Bromeliaceae or how this role relates to the diversification of specific lineages. In this paper, I present a synthesis of the current knowledge on bromeliad water relations and a qualitative model of the evolution of relevant traits in the context of the functional types. I use this model to introduce a manifesto for a new research programme on the integrative biology and evolution of bromeliad water-use strategies. The need for a wide-ranging survey of morphoanatomical and hydraulic traits across Bromeliaceae is stressed, as this would provide extensive insight into structure-function relationships of relevance to the evolutionary history of bromeliads and, more generally, to the evolutionary physiology of flowering plants.

AB A common theme in plant physiological research is the trade-off between stress tolerance and growth; an example of this trade-off at the tissue level is the safety vs efficiency hypothesis, which suggests that plants with the greatest resistance to hydraulic failure should have low maximum hydraulic conductance.
   Here, we quantified the leaf-level drought tolerance of nine C-4 grasses as the leaf water potential at which plants lost 50% (P-50 (x) (RR)) of maximum leaf hydraulic conductance (K-sat), and compared this trait with other leaf-level and whole-plant functions.
   We found a clear trade-off between Ksat and P-50 x RR when Ksat was normalized by leaf area and mass (P = 0.05 and 0.01, respectively). However, no trade-off existed between P-50 x RR and gas-exchange rates; rather, there was a positive relationship between P-50 x RR and photosynthesis (P = 0.08). P-50 x RR was not correlated with species distributions based on precipitation (P = 0.70), but was correlated with temperature during the wettest quarter of the year (P < 0.01).
   These results suggest a trade-off between safety and efficiency in the hydraulic system of grass leaves, which can be decoupled from other leaf-level functions. The unique physiology of C-4 plants and adaptations to pulse-driven systems may provide mechanisms that could decouple hydraulic conductance from other plant functions.

AB Crops experience different climate stresses during development. The magnitude of damage will depend on the phenological stage of the crop and the stress duration. Climate change could intensify some or all of these stresses, thus negatively impacting agriculture. An assessment of staple crop productivity, quality and climatically suitable areas under climate change conditions is necessary to undertake any global initiatives to tackle food security issues. The common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) is a staple crop and the main source of proteins and nutrients in Africa and Latin America. The purpose of this study is to develop a process-oriented niche model to assess the impacts of climate change on the current and future potential distribution of common bean and to use this model to investigate the changes in heat, cold, dry and wet stresses under climate change. We used A2 and A1B emission scenarios and two different global climate models, CSIRO-Mk3.0 and MIROC-H, for the years 2050 and 2100. Our results indicate future climate conditions are more favorable for common bean cultivation in the Northern Hemisphere, but are less favorable in the Southern Hemisphere. Heat and dry stresses are the main factors limiting and reducing common bean distribution under current and future projected conditions. Africa and Latin America are projected to decrease with respect to suitability for common bean cultivation. The model projections indicate that a shift in the common bean productive areas is highly likely with a loss of suitability of the current common bean cultivation areas and an increase in cold regions such as Canada, the Nordic countries and Russia. The results indicate the likelihood of changes in climatic suitability and the distribution of common bean at a global scale under a future climate, which will affect regions where this legume is a staple crop and an important source of household income. Regions in the Northern Hemisphere could take advantage of the increase in suitability by increasing the production and exportation of this grain. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi, as important plant mutualists, can protect host plants against environmental stresses, including heavy metal contaminations. It is generally accepted that improvement of plant P nutrition by AM symbiosis plays an important role in plant tolerance to heavy metals. In the present study, we tested if exogenous P amendment to the chromium (Cr) contaminated soil could match the positive effects of AM symbiosis on plant Cr tolerance for the highly mycorrhizal dependent plant dandelion (Taraxacum platypecidum Diels.). Experimental results showed that P addition could not enhance plant growth as well as AM symbiosis did. AM fungi could immobilize Cr in mycorrhizal roots besides enhancing plant P acquisition. Cr distribution pattern in principal roots as revealed by synchrotron radiation micro-focused X-ray fluorescence (SR mu-XRF) analysis supported the stabilization of Cr in mycorrrihzal roots. Furthermore, by using a three-compartment cultivation system, we demonstrated that extraradical mycelium (ERM) could take up and transport Cr to mycorrhizal roots, but restrained Cr translocation from roots to shoots, and thus contributed to Cr immobilization in roots and relieved Cr phytotoxicity.

AB To fully understand macroevolutionary patterns and processes, we need to include both extant and extinct species in our models. This requires phylogenetic trees with both living and fossil taxa at the tips. One way to infer such phylogenies is the Total Evidence approach which uses molecular data from living taxa and morphological data from living and fossil taxa.
   Although the Total Evidence approach is very promising, it requires a great deal of data that can be hard to collect. Therefore this method is likely to suffer from missing data issues that may affect its ability to infer correct phylogenies.
   Here we use simulations to assess the effects of missing data on tree topologies inferred from Total Evidence matrices. We investigate three major factors that directly affect the completeness and the size of the morphological part of the matrix: the proportion of living taxa with no morphological data, the amount of missing data in the fossil record, and the overall number of morphological characters in the matrix. We infer phylogenies from complete matrices and from matrices with various amounts of missing data, and then compare missing data topologies to the "best" tree topology inferred using the complete matrix.
   We find that the number of living taxa with morphological characters and the overall number of morphological characters in the matrix, are more important than the amount of missing data in the fossil record for recovering the "best" tree topology. Therefore, we suggest that sampling effort should be focused on morphological data collection for living species to increase the accuracy of topological inference in a Total Evidence framework. Additionally, we find that Bayesian methods consistently outperform other tree inference methods. We therefore recommend using Bayesian consensus trees to fix the tree topology prior to further analyses. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Predicting the effects of fire on biota is important for biodiversity conservation in fire-prone landscapes. Time since fire is often used to predict the occurrence of fauna, yet for many species, it is a surrogate variable and it is temporal change in resource availability to which animals actually respond. Therefore prediction of fire fauna relationships will be uncertain if time since fire is not strongly related to resources. In this study, we used a space-for-time substitution across a large diverse landscape to investigate interrelationships between the occurrence of ground-dwelling mammals, time since fire, and structural resources. We predicted that much variation in habitat structure would remain unexplained by time since fire and that habitat structure would predict species' occurrence better than time since fire. In line with predictions, we found that time since fire was moderately correlated with habitat structure yet was a poor surrogate for mammal occurrence. Variables representing habitat structure were better predictors of occurrence than time since fire for all species considered. Our results suggest that time since fire is unlikely to be a useful surrogate for ground-dwelling mammals in heterogeneous landscapes. Faunal conservation in fire-prone landscapes will benefit from a combined understanding of fauna-resource relationships and the ways in which fire (including planned fires and wildfires) alters the spatial and temporal distribution of faunal resources.

AB Identifying spatiotemporal hotspots is important for understanding basic ecological processes, but is particularly important for species at risk. A number of terrestrial and aquatic species are indirectly affected by anthropogenic impacts, simply because they tend to be associated with species that are targeted for removals. Using newly developed statistical models that allow for the inclusion of time-varying spatial effects, we examine how the co-occurrence of a targeted and nontargeted species can be modeled as a function of environmental covariates (temperature, depth) and interannual variability. The nontarget species in our case study (eulachon) is listed under the U.S. Endangered Species Act, and is encountered by fisheries off the U.S. West Coast that target pink shrimp. Results from our spatiotemporal model indicated that eulachon bycatch risk decreases with depth and has a convex relationship with sea surface temperature. Additionally, we found that over the 2007 2012 period, there was support for an increase in eulachon density from both a fishery data set (+40%) and a fishery-independent data set (+55%). Eulachon bycatch has increased in recent years, but the agreement between these two data sets implies that increases in bycatch are not due to an increase in incidental targeting of eulachon by fishing vessels, but because of an increasing population size of eulachon. Based on our results, the application of spatiotemporal models to species that are of conservation concern appears promising in identifying the spatial distribution of environmental and anthropogenic risks to the population.

AB Twelve eulachon (Thaleichthys pacificus, Osmeridae) populations ranging from Cook Inlet, Alaska and along the west coast of North America to the Columbia River were examined by restriction-site-associated DNA (RAD) sequencing to elucidate patterns of neutral and adaptive variation in this high geneflow species. A total of 4104 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were discovered across the genome, with 193 putatively adaptive SNPs as determined by F-ST outlier tests. Estimates of population structure in eulachon with the putatively adaptive SNPs were similar, but provided greater resolution of stocks compared with a putatively neutral panel of 3911 SNPs or previous estimates with 14 microsatellites. A cline of increasing measures of genetic diversity from south to north was found in the adaptive panel, but not in the neutral markers (SNPs or microsatellites). This may indicate divergent selective pressures in differing freshwater and marine environments between regional eulachon populations and that these adaptive diversity patterns not seen with neutral markers could be a consideration when determining genetic boundaries for conservation purposes. Estimates of effective population size (N-e) were similar with the neutral SNP panel and microsatellites and may be utilized to monitor population status for eulachon where census sizes are difficult to obtain. Greater differentiation with the panel of putatively adaptive SNPs provided higher individual assignment accuracy compared to the neutral panel or microsatellites for stock identification purposes. This study presents the first SNPs that have been developed for eulachon, and analyses with these markers highlighted the importance of integrating genome-wide neutral and adaptive genetic variation for the applications of conservation and management.

AB Carbon stock and CO2 emissions in agricultural systems are highly affected by the management of applied practices in arable farms, such as fertilizer use, irrigation, soil tillage, cover crop management, etc. This study evaluated the effects of various organic mulches, nitrogen fertilization and irrigation levels on soil CO2 emissions, soil carbon sequestration and processing tomato production in the Mediterranean environment. The field experiment was carried out with five main treatments, three cover crops of hairy vetch (HV), lacy phacelia (LF) and white mustard (WM) transplanted in autumn and cut in May to be used as mulches, plus barley straw mulch (BS) and conventional (C) (bare soil). After tomato transplanting, the main plots were split into two nitrogen fertilization treatments (0 and 100 kg N ha(-1)) and the sub-plots were then split again into three irrigation levels (irrigation water 100%, 75%, 50% of evapotranspiration). In all treatments, a general effect was observed in the temporal fluctuations of soil CO2 emissions throughout the observation period which were significantly influenced by soil temperature and water content. The temporal fluctuations of the soil CO2 emissions were attributed to climatic conditions and the peaks achieved optimal conditions of soil temperature and water content for soil respiration. A larger amount of TOC was observed in the mulching treatments than in the control after tomato harvesting (on average 1.44% vs 1.33%, respectively and on average 1.43% in HV trastment), probably due to the residual biomass of the cover crops and a greater growth of the tomato. Although the soil carbon output as cumulated CO2 emissions did not show statistically significant differences between the treatments, the soil carbon balance enabled us to estimate the highest net carbon contribution to the soil in HV determined by inputs and input/output ratio. However, except for the BS in 2013, the input/output ratios were >1 in all mulch treatments. In the Mediterranean environment, agronomical practices, such as the use of hairy vetch mulch on notilled soil, a slight reduction of irrigation water (-25%) and a rationalized use of N fertilizer potentially could shift the C balance in favor of soil C accumulation.

AB AimSpecies and ecosystems may be unable to keep pace with rapid climate change projected for the 21st century. We evaluated an underexplored dimension of the mismatch between climate and biota: limitations to forest growth and succession affecting habitat suitability. Our objective was to inform continental-scale conservation for boreal songbirds under disequilibria between climate, vegetation and fauna.
   LocationBoreal and southern arctic ecoregions of North America.
   MethodsWe used forest inventory and avian survey data to classify 53 species by seral-stage affinity and applied these to generate alternative projections of changes in species' core habitat distributions based on different vegetation lag-time assumptions. We used our seral stage-modified refugia approach and the Zonation algorithm to identify multispecies boreal conservation priorities over the 21st century. We evaluated the sensitivity of land rankings to seral-stage affinity and species' weights and assessed the conservation value of the existing protected areas network compared to Zonation results.
   ResultsEnd-of-century projected changes in songbird distribution were reduced by up to 169% when vegetation lags were considered. Zonation land rankings based on unconstrained climate projections were concentrated at high latitudes, whereas those based on strict and modified refugia scenarios were concentrated in coastal and high-elevation areas, as well as biome transition zones, which were fairly consistent over time and species weights. The existing protected areas network covering 14% of the study area was estimated to conserve 12-14% of baseline avian biodiversity across time periods and scenarios, compared to 16-25% for top-ranked Zonation areas.
   Main conclusionsFor some boreal songbirds, limits to forest growth and succession may result in dramatic reductions in suitable habitat over the next century. Our seral stage-adjusted approach provides conservative and efficient boreal conservation priorities anchored around climatic macrorefugia that are robust to century-long climate change and complement the current protected areas network.

AB The global redistribution of biodiversity will intensify in the coming decades of climate change, making projections of species range shifts and of associated genetic losses important components of conservation planning. Highly-structured marine species, notably brown seaweeds, often harbor unique genetic variation at warmer low-latitude rear edges and thus are of particular concern. Here, a combination of Ecological Niche Models (ENMs) and molecular data is used to forecast the potential near-future impacts of climate change for a warm-temperate, canopy forming seaweed, Bifurcaria bifurcata. ENMs for B. bifurcata were developed using marine and terrestrial climatic variables, and its range projected for 2040-50 and 2090-2100 under two greenhouse emission scenarios. Geographical patterns of genetic diversity were assessed by screening 18 populations spawning the entire distribution for two organelle genes and 6 microsatellite markers. The southern limit of B. bifurcata was predicted to shift northwards to central Morocco by the mid-century. By 2090-2100, depending on the emission scenario, it could either retreat further north to western Iberia or be relocated back to Western Sahara. At the opposing margin, B. bifurcata was predicted to expand its range to Scotland or even Norway. Microsatellite diversity and endemism were highest in Morocco, where a unique and very restricted lineage was also identified. Our results imply that B. bifurcata will maintain a relatively broad latitudinal distribution. Although its persistence is not threatened, the predicted extirpation of a unique southern lineage or even the entire Moroccan diversity hotspot will erase a rich evolutionary legacy and shrink global diversity to current (low) European levels. NW Africa and similarly understudied southern regions should receive added attention if expected range changes and diversity loss of warm-temperate species is not to occur unnoticed.

AB Background: Schistosomiasis is a water-based disease that affects an estimated 250 million people, mainly in sub-Saharan Africa. The transmission of schistosomiasis is spatially and temporally restricted to freshwater bodies that contain schistosome cercariae released from specific snails that act as intermediate hosts. Our objective was to assess the contribution of remote sensing applications and to identify remaining challenges in its optimal application for schistosomiasis risk profiling in order to support public health authorities to better target control interventions.
   Methods: We reviewed the literature (i) to deepen our understanding of the ecology and the epidemiology of schistosomiasis, placing particular emphasis on remote sensing; and (ii) to fill an identified gap, namely interdisciplinary research that bridges different strands of scientific inquiry to enhance spatially explicit risk profiling. As a first step, we reviewed key factors that govern schistosomiasis risk. Secondly, we examined remote sensing data and variables that have been used for risk profiling of schistosomiasis. Thirdly, the linkage between the ecological consequence of environmental conditions and the respective measure of remote sensing data were synthesised.
   Results: We found that the potential of remote sensing data for spatial risk profiling of schistosomiasis is - in principle - far greater than explored thus far. Importantly though, the application of remote sensing data requires a tailored approach that must be optimised by selecting specific remote sensing variables, considering the appropriate scale of observation and modelling within ecozones. Interestingly, prior studies that linked prevalence of Schistosoma infection to remotely sensed data did not reflect that there is a spatial gap between the parasite and intermediate host snail habitats where disease transmission occurs, and the location (community or school) where prevalence measures are usually derived from.
   Conclusions: Our findings imply that the potential of remote sensing data for risk profiling of schistosomiasis and other neglected tropical diseases has yet to be fully exploited.

AB AimSoftware use is ubiquitous in the species distribution modelling (SDM) domain; nearly every scientist working on SDM either uses or develops specialist SDM software; however, little is formally known about the prevalence or preference of one software over another. We seek to provide, for the first time, a snapshot' of SDM users, the methods they use and the questions they answer.
   LocationGlobal.
   MethodsWe conducted a survey of over 300 SDM scientists to capture a snapshot of the community and used an extensive literature search of SDM papers in order to investigate the characteristics of the SDM community and its interactions with software developers in terms of co-authoring research publications.
   ResultsOur results show that those members of the community who develop software and who are directly connected with developers are among the most highly connected and published authors in the field. We further show that the two most popular softwares for SDM lie at opposite ends of the use-complexity' continuum.
   Main conclusionGiven the importance of SDM research in a changing environment, with its increasing use in the policy domain, it is vital to be aware of what software and methodologies are being implemented. Here, we present a snapshot of the SDM community, the software and the methods being used.

AB Long-distance dispersal (LDD) processes influence the founder effect on islands. We use genetic data for 25 Atlantic species and similarities among regional floras to analyse colonization, and test whether the genetic founder effect on five islands is associated with dispersal distance, island size and species traits. Most species colonized postglacially via multiple dispersal events from several source regions situated 280 to >3000 km away, and often not from the closest ones. A strong founder effect was observed for insect-pollinated mixed maters, and it increased with dispersal distance and decreased with island size in accordance with the theory of island biogeography. Only a minor founder effect was observed for wind-pollinated outcrossing species. Colonization patterns were largely congruent, indicating that despite the importance of stochasticity, LDD is mainly determined by common factors, probably dispersal vectors. Our findings caution against a priori assuming a single, close source region in biogeographic analyses.

AB Amphibians and reptiles as a group are often secretive, reach their greatest diversity often in remote tropical regions, and contain some of the most endangered groups of organisms on earth. Particularly in the past decade, genetics and genomics have been instrumental in the conservation biology of these cryptic vertebrates, enabling work ranging from the identification of populations subject to trade and exploitation, to the identification of cryptic lineages harboring critical genetic variation, to the analysis of genes controlling key life history traits. In this review, we highlight some of the most important ways that genetic analyses have brought new insights to the conservation of amphibians and reptiles. Although genomics has only recently emerged as part of this conservation tool kit, several large-scale data sources, including full genomes, expressed sequence tags, and transcriptomes, are providing new opportunities to identify key genes, quantify landscape effects, and manage captive breeding stocks of at-risk species.

AB The practice of feeding wild birds is a widespread phenomenon, but there has been little consideration of both human and ecological dimensions of the impacts. We used a comprehensive approach to investigate the practice of bird feeding in the unique avian landscape of New Zealand. We quantified the practice and motivations of bird feeding via a nationwide postal survey, and identified ecological risks from current feeding practices. Our study confirmed that, as in many northern hemisphere countries, bird feeding is a common activity in New Zealand, with an estimated 46.6% of households feeding birds. Increased age and dog ownership were strongly associated with participation. Bread was most commonly provided; we estimated 5.1 million loaves/annum across the population of 1.8 million in six surveyed cities. The principal potential risk identified was that introduced birds are likely to be the main consumers of supplementary food sources in New Zealand, which may have follow-on effects for avian community composition. Disease transmission risks were also identified, with poor hygiene practices reported by many respondents. However, the social benefits to humans of feeding birds were strongly reflected in the motivations of the respondents. Over half fed birds because it brought them pleasure. As urbanisation increases globally, opportunities for connecting with nature decrease. Therefore, experiences such as bird feeding that increase the interaction between people and wildlife could be a powerful tool for fostering environmental awareness and guardianship. Our study highlights that without information about ecological consequences, humans may inadvertently make harmful choices for wildlife, so we recommend promulgation of appropriate guidelines to minimise the risks.

AB Aim Granite outcrops are prominent throughout the world and harbour many endemic species. Their topographic complexity and range of environments have led to the hypothesis that they act as refugia facilitating the persistence of species through climate change. We evaluate this hypothesis by investigating the phylogeographic patterns in a common granite endemic shrub.
   Location Granite outcrops of the Southwest Australian Floristic Region.
   Methods Chloroplast haplotypes of 89 Kunzea pulchella individuals from 16 granite outcrops were determined from sequences of three chloroplast intergenic spacer regions. Phylogenetic reconstruction and divergence dating was inferred using Bayesian and Parsimony analyses and phylogenetic relationships between haplotypes were examined in relation to geographic distributions. Nuclear diversity and differentiation of populations were assessed through analysis of 11 nuclear microsatellite loci across 384 individuals from the 16 granite outcrops.
   Results Kunzea pulchella exhibited low haplotype and allelic diversity within outcrops and high levels of divergence among outcrops, indicating an ancient restriction to specific outcrops with genetic drift as the main driver of evolution. Two divergent lineages were revealed in the chloroplast phylogeny dating to the Pliocene and potentially reflecting the initial impact of increased aridity prior to isolation on individual outcrops.
   Main conclusions Rather than uncovering the typical pattern for Pleistocene refugia with contraction to, and expansion from particular granite outcrops, we observed persistence, prolonged isolation and divergence of populations. We suggest the persistence of K. pulchella on multiple outcrops through a period of considerable climatic change may be a result of broad climatic tolerances or contraction and expansion dynamics operating at microrefugial scales within outcrops. Our observations of low haplotype and allelic diversity within populations of K. pulchella provide some support for the latter. The enduring nature of K. pulchella and evolutionary potential of populations on individual outcrops accentuates the value of these environments for biodiversity conservation planning in a changing climate.

AB Water temperature and streamflow intermittency are critical parameters influencing aquatic ecosystem health. Low-cost temperature loggers have made continuous water temperature monitoring relatively simple but determining streamflow timing and intermittency using temperature data alone requires significant and subjective data interpretation. Electrical resistance (ER) sensors have recently been developed to overcome the major limitations of temperature-based methods for the assessment of streamflow intermittency. This technical note introduces the STIC (Stream Temperature, Intermittency, and Conductivity logger); a robust, low-cost, simple to build instrument that provides long-duration, high-resolution monitoring of both relative conductivity (RC) and temperature. Simultaneously collected temperature and RC data provide unambiguous water temperature and streamflow intermittency information that is crucial for monitoring aquatic ecosystem health and assessing regulatory compliance. With proper calibration, the STIC relative conductivity data can be used to monitor specific conductivity.

AB C4 photosynthesis has higher light, nitrogen, and water use efficiencies than C3 photosynthesis. Although the basic anatomical, cellular, and biochemical features of C4 photosynthesis are well understood, the quantitative significance of each element of C4 photosynthesis to the high photosynthetic efficiency are not well defined. Here, we addressed this question by developing and using a systems model of C4 photosynthesis, which includes not only the Calvin-Benson cycle, starch synthesis, sucrose synthesis, C4 shuttle, and CO2 leakage, but also photorespiration and metabolite transport between the bundle sheath cells and mesophyll cells. The model effectively simulated the CO2 uptake rates, and the changes of metabolite concentrations under varied CO2 and light levels. Analyses show that triose phosphate transport and CO2 leakage can help maintain a high photosynthetic rate by balancing ATP and NADPH amounts in bundle sheath cells and mesophyll cells. Finally, we used the model to define the optimal enzyme properties and a blueprint for C4 engineering. As such, this model provides a theoretical framework for guiding C4 engineering and studying C4 photosynthesis in general.

AB The expression of genes encoding various enzymes participating in photosynthetic and respiratory metabolism is regulated by light via the phytochrome system. While many photosynthetic, photorespiratory and some respiratory enzymes, such as the rotenone-insensitive NADH and NADPH dehydrogenases and the alternative oxidase, are stimulated by light, succinate dehydrogenase, subunits of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, cytochrome oxidase and fumarase are inhibited via the phytochrome mechanism. The effect of light, therefore, imposes limitations on the tricarboxylic acid cycle and on the mitochondrial electron transport coupled to ATP synthesis, while the non-coupled pathways become activated. Phytochrome-mediated regulation of gene expression also creates characteristic distribution patterns of photosynthetic, photorespiratory and respiratory enzymes across the leaf generating different populations of mitochondria, either enriched by glycine decarboxylase (in the upper part) or by succinate dehydrogenase (in the bottom part of the leaf).

AB Large budgets are spent on both suppression and fuel treatments in order to reduce the risk of wildfires. There is little evidence regarding the relative contribution of fire weather, suppression and fuel treatments in determining the risk posed from wildfires. Here we undertake a simulation study in the Sydney Basin, Australia, to examine this question using a fire behaviour model (Phoenix Rapidfire). Results of the study indicate that fire behaviour is most strongly influenced by fire weather. Suppression has a greater influence on whether a fire reaches 5 ha in size compared to fuel treatments. In contrast, fuel treatments have a stronger effect on the fire size and maximum distance the fire travels. The study suggests that fire management agencies will receive additional benefits from fuel treatment if they are located in areas which suppression resources can respond rapidly and attempt to contain the fires. No combination of treatments contained all fires, and the proportion of uncontained fires increased under more severe fire weather when the greatest number of properties are lost. Our study highlights the importance of alternative management strategies to reduce the risk of property loss. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Due to their ubiquity and highly efficient passive dispersal, benthic diatoms are an ideal group in which to explore the drivers of community spatial structure and the ultimate links between such patterns and species autoecology. However, studies addressing these issues have largely overlooked unicellular taxa to date. We examined the spatial order (i.e. nestedness) of a diatom meta-community of 122 lotic sites in the north-east Iberian Peninsula and the relationship between the contributions of individual species to nestedness and their niche breadths [measured using outlying mean index (OMI) analyses]. We observed a significantly nested pattern in the meta-community (T=14.05, NODF=22.57), although idiosyncratic species accounted for a substantial fraction (34%) of the global species pool. Hydrological stability was identified as the main driver of nestedness. Highly stable, moderately stable and intermittent sites differed in nestedness and in alpha diversity, with intermittent sites being the most species poor and the least nested. We also observed a significant association between nestedness and niche attributes, with idiosyncratic species exhibiting wider distributions and larger niche breadths compared with nested species. Overall, our results indicate that diatom communities inhabiting hydrologically stable rivers present a higher level of order in community spatial pattern and a higher proportion of specialist taxa than communities in intermittent streams. Because recent hydroclimatic models predict an increase in stream intermittency in the Mediterranean region, our findings may help anticipate future diatom biodiversity patterns resulting from global change. We suggest that the current need to protect a diverse network of sites (as opposed to a few species-rich sites) will be even greater in the near future because local communities are not only probably to become taxonomically and functionally poorer but also less predictable, making it more difficult to implement efficient programmes for biodiversity conservation at the regional scale.

AB Refuges protect plant and animal populations from disturbance. Knowledge of refuges from disturbance in mediterranean climate rivers (med-rivers) has increased the last decade. We review disturbance processes and their relationship to refuges in streams in mediterranean climate regions (med-regions). Med-river fauna show high endemicity and their populations are often exposed to disturbance; hence the critical importance of refuges during (both seasonal and supraseasonal) disturbances. Disturbance pressures are increasing in med-regions, in particular from climatic change, salinisation, sedimentation, water extraction, hydropower generation, supraseasonal drought, and wildfire. Med-rivers show annual cycles of constrained precipitation and predictable seasonal drying, causing the biota to depend on seasonal refuges, in particular, those that are spatially predictable. This creates a spatial and temporal mosaic of inundation that determines habitat extent and refuge function. Refuges of sufficient size and duration to maintain populations, such as perennially flowing reaches, sustain biodiversity and may harbour relict populations, particularly during increasing aridification, where little other suitable habitat remains in landscapes. Therefore, disturbances that threaten perennial flows potentially cascade disproportionately to reduce regional scale biodiversity in med-regions. Conservation approaches for med-river systems need to conserve both refuges and refuge connectivity, reduce the impact of anthropogenic disturbances and sustain predictable, seasonal flow patterns.

TI Can biodiversity monitoring schemes provide indicators for ecosystem

DT Article
DE Biodiversity; Monitoring; Habitats; Scales; Ecosystem services; Europe
ID IMPACT; CLASSIFICATION; FRAMEWORK; NEED
AB Recently, the science and policy agenda on biodiversity moved to include ecosystem services assessments and it is recognised that for determining the effectiveness and progress of policy frameworks monitoring is crucial.
   Within European monitoring schemes, data. is collected following different sampling protocols for a range of biodiversity or context related aspects; from EU-wide general land cover mapping to red list species within Annex I habitats. In this paper, we analysed field instructions of seven monitoring schemes on the extent to which they can provide data on the provision of ecosystem services and what additional information may be needed for future monitoring of ecosystem services.
   We compared seven monitoring schemes (i.e. CORINE Land Cover, Land Use Cover Area Survey (LUCAS), European Biodiversity Observation Network (EBONE), biodiversity monitoring on organic and low-input farming systems (BioBio), National Inventory of the Landscape of Sweden (NILS) and Pan-European Common Birds Monitoring (PECBM) and UK Butterfly monitoring (UK-BM)) by scoring the quality of recorded parameters and the adequacy of sampling protocols for ecosystem service monitoring.
   All the examined schemes were able to provide some parameters on ecosystem services, but the quality of the parameters on average did not exceed the level of qualitative data. Additionally, the divergence between the sampling designs of the schemes and the spatial characteristics of ecosystem services reduced the potential monitoring value of all schemes. Monitoring schemes including a range of sampling methods, scales and included the recording of data on habitats, such as EBONE, BioBio and NILS, provided the best data on the provision of ecosystem services. We conclude that improvement of the monitoring of ecosystem services is hindered by several knowledge gaps: (I) a robust definition and conceptual framework of ecosystem services; (2) the linkage between biodiversity and ecosystem services; and (3) the interpretation of monitoring data.
   In addition to ecosystem service monitoring, biodiversity monitoring unremittingly remains very important, at least to identify trade-offs between the management for services and the resulting biodiversity status. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Conservation of the unique biodiversity of mountain ecosystems needs trans-disciplinary approaches to succeed in a crowded colloquial world. Geographers, conservationists, ecologists and social scientists have, in the past, had the same conservation goals but have tended to work independently. In this review, the need to integrate different conservation criteria and methodologies is discussed. New criteria are offered for prioritizing species and habitats for conservation in montane ecosystems that combine both ecological and social data.
   Ecological attributes of plant species, analysed through robust community statistical packages, provide unbiased classifications of species assemblages and environmental biodiversity gradients and yield importance value indices (IVIs). Surveys of local communities utilization of the vegetation provides use values (UVs). This review suggests a new means of assessing anthropogenic pressure on plant biodiversity at both species and community levels by integrating IVI and UV data sets in a combined analysis.
   Mountain ecosystems are hot spots for plant conservation efforts because they hold a high overall plant diversity as communities replace each other along altitudinal and climatic gradients, including a high proportion of endemic species. This review contributes an enhanced understanding of (1) plant diversity in mountain ecosystems with special reference to the western Himalayas; (2) ethnobotanical and ecosystem service values of mountain vegetation within the context of anthropogenic impacts; and (3) local and regional plant conservation strategies and priorities.

AB Studies on fishers' ecological knowledge (FEK) and local ecological knowledge (LEK) have rarely been undertaken for practical application in a management context. Here, we describe a methodology to access FEK that was designed under an ecosystem-based fisheries management framework. The procedure was adapted from the Delphi technique, which seeks experts' consensus, and focused on several spatial and temporal issues related to the small-scale fisheries of the northern coast of sao Paulo, Brazil (particularly, in Ubatuba, between 23 degrees 20' S and 23 degrees 35' S). Experienced fishers, considered as experts, were selected during a pilot phase to participate in two sequential rounds of semi-structured interviews at 3 main landing sites and 12 coastal fishing communities. The issues addressed were: (1) spatial and seasonal occurrence of mature females and juveniles of the main commercial species, (2) fishing grounds and bycatch species for each type of fishing gear, and (3) fishers' suggestions for local fisheries management (e.g. mesh and size of gillnets, closure seasons, gear restrictions by fishing area). It was possible to identify consensus rates on the spatial and temporal issues, as well as on fishers' management suggestions. The former allowed the construction of maps representing fishing grounds and the local spatial distribution of different fishery stocks strata. We illustrate the output by focusing on five fishery stocks: the seabobshrimp Xiphopenaeus kroyeri, the whitemouth croaker Micropogonias furnieri, the inshore squid Loligo spp, the white shrimp Litopenaeus schimitti and the blue runner Caranx aysos. Overall, the results provided new guidelines for future local fisheries management and conservation initiatives. The methodology proved to be useful for the definition of essential fish habitats (EFHs), suggesting their potential application in other locations. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Theory suggests that predators of soil-improving, plant-facilitating detritivores (e.g. earthworms) should suppress plant growth via a negative tri-trophic cascade, but the empirical evidence is still largely lacking. We tested this prediction in an alpine meadow on the Tibetan Plateau by manipulating predatory beetles (presence/absence) and quantifying (i) direct effects on the density and behaviour of earthworms; and (ii) indirect effects on soil properties and above-ground plant biomass. In the absence of predators, earthworms improved soil properties, but did not significantly affect plant biomass. Surprisingly, the presence of predators strengthened the positive effect of earthworms on soil properties leading to the emergence of a positive indirect effect of predators on plant biomass. We attribute this counterintuitive result to: (i) the inability of predators to suppress overall earthworm density; and (ii) the predator-induced earthworm habitat shift from the upper to lower soil layer that enhanced their soil-modifying, plant-facilitating, effects. Our results reveal that plant-level consequences of predators as transmitted through detritivores can hinge on behaviour-mediated indirect interactions that have the potential to overturn predictions based solely on trophic interactions. This work calls for a closer examination of the effects of predators in detritus food webs and the development of spatially explicit theory capable of predicting the occurrence and consequences of predator-induced detritivore behavioural shifts.

AB The drivers of species diversification and persistence are of great interest to current biogeography, especially in those global biodiversity hotspots' harbouring most of Earth's animal and plant life. Classical multispecies biogeographical work has yielded fascinating insights into broad-scale patterns of diversification, and DNA-based intraspecific phylogeographical studies have started to complement this picture at much finer temporal and spatial scales. The advent of novel next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies provides the opportunity to greatly scale up the numbers of individuals, populations and species sampled, potentially merging intraspecific and interspecific approaches to biogeographical inference. Here, we outline these prospects and issues by using the example of an undisputed hotspot, the Cape of southern Africa. We outline the current state of knowledge on the biogeography of species diversification within the Cape, review the literature for phylogeographical evidence of its likely drivers and mechanisms, and suggest possible ways forward based on NGS approaches. We demonstrate the potential of these methods and current bioinformatic issues with the help of restriction-site-associated DNA (RAD) sequencing data for three highly divergent species of the Restionaceae, an important plant radiation in the Cape. A thorough understanding of the mechanisms that facilitate species diversification and persistence in spatially structured, species-rich environments will require the adoption of novel genomic and bioinformatic tools in biogeographical studies.

AB To improve sustainability and increase economic returns, producers in the semiarid Canadian prairie are diversifying their cropping systems to include alternative crops such as pulses and oilseeds in rotation with wheat. Producers must adopt crops and cropping systems that use water most efficiently. We compared the root systems and water withdrawal patterns for three pulse crops (leguminous grain crops) [chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.), pea (Pisum sativum L.) and lentil (Lens culinaris Medik. L.)] and three oilseed crops [canola (Brassica napus L. and Brassica rapa L.) and mustard (Brassica juncea L.)] with one cereal crop [wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)] under well-watered, rain-fed, imposed drought water regimes during 1996-1998. Wheat withdrew the most water, whereas pulses withdrew the least amount of water from the soil profile. Pulses withdrew substantially less water than oilseeds and wheat below about the 80-cm depth, whereas oilseeds withdrew less water than wheat from the upper regions of the soil profile, thus increasing soil water available to the following crops. Therefore, producers can increase the overall efficiency of a crop rotation by growing deeper rooting crops, such as wheat and canola, following pulses, and by growing crops, such as wheat, that will use the increased soil water reserves following canola.

AB In response to Federal listing of the Delta Smelt Hypomesus transpacificus as a threatened species in 1993, intensive fish culture techniques were developed to provide a supply of fish for research activities. The Delta Smelt was listed as endangered by the state of California in 2009, and several agencies worked quickly to develop a captive refuge population under genetic management. Captive 2-year-old wild-origin Delta Smelt served as the founding population in 2008. Each year, 250 genetically selected, single pair crosses are made in vitro, and the resultant full-sibling families are combined to rear in multifamily groups. Typically, eight families are reared together from egg to adult stage, with 80% or more of the initial families represented at the adult stage. Multifamily rearing provides an efficient way of achieving a breeding population of 500 in a smaller facility. Juvenile survival increased from 18% in 2009 to 39% in 2010, as facilities and methodologies improved. Growth rate also increased significantly from 2009 to 2010 (from 0.19 to 0.25mm/d). Subdermal alphanumeric tags identified individuals and allowed spawning of select individuals to preserve genetic diversity in the refuge population. Group marking, by adipose fin clip, provided efficiencies in time and space. Tagging and genetic analyses enabled in vitro spawning of recommended pair crosses each year. At present, we recommend completing the majority of spawning from February to mid-May and continuing to augment the refuge population with wild fish each year. The refuge population provides one type of safeguard against species extinction and provides an example for endangered fish culture. Received March 16, 2012; accepted November 18, 2012

AB Medicago sativa L. is the most important forage crop in arid and semi-arid areas, where increased salinity is a major factor limiting plant growth and crop productivity. The role of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungus Glomus viscosum H.T. Nicolson strain A6 in protecting alfalfa plants from salt stress, induced by sodium chloride (NaCl), was studied in two ways. Firstly, the root systems of 3-month old M. sativa plants, both mycorrhizal (AM+) and non-mycorrhizal (non-AM) (M. sativa L. var. icon), were placed in solutions of increasing salt concentrations (0, 50, 100, 150, 200 mM NaCl) to study the wilting response. G. viscosum improved the tolerance to salinity stress and the benefit was expressed in terms of the time required to reach the T4 stage in the wilting experiment. Secondly, to evaluate the ability of the Glomus-alfalfa symbiosis to tolerate salt, a pot experiment was set up in a glasshouse in which 3-month old alfalfa plants (M. sativa var. icon) were grown in a peat substratum at three salinity levels (0, 100, 150 mM NaCl). The AM symbiosis stimulated plant height, leaf area, root density, fresh and dry plant weight under saline conditions. Furthermore, proline accumulation was higher in mycorrhizal M. sativa plants than in non-mycorrhizal plants under conditions of salt stress. These and other results indicated that the micropropagated selected clone of M. sativa var. icon, when in symbiosis with G. viscosum H.T. Nicolson strain A6, exhibited better growth and physiological activities under saline conditions than non-AM plants. The AM+ plants also had lower sodium and chloride concentrations in tissues than non-AM plants.

AB Increasing evidence suggests that climate change is negatively affecting marine ecosystems and biota. However, little is known of how climate change will impact marine mammals. This review aims to identify the effects of climatic variations on Australian marine mammals and determine their potential responses to climate change. Shifts in distributions and reproductive success have been associated with climatic factors, while stranding events, drowning of seal pups, exposure to altered water conditions and disease in several marine mammal species have followed extreme weather events. Climate change may produce distributional shifts as the ranges of warm-water species expand or shift southwards, and those of cold-water species contract. Reductions in the extent of key habitats, changes in breeding success, a greater incidence of strandings in dugongs and cetaceans, and increased exposure of coastal species to pollutants and pathogens are likely. The capacity of Australian marine mammals to adapt to climate change is poorly understood, though there is evidence that several species may be able to modify their physiology or behaviour in response to warming temperatures. To increase the resilience of marine mammals, it is necessary to address non-climatic threats, such as ensuring that key habitats are protected in Australia.

AB We studied the relations of aquatic macrophyte communities, ecological quality metrics and water quality to lake characteristics and to land use defined at multiple spatial scales (three lake marginal zones (LMZs) of contrasting width and the whole topographic catchment) in 110 boreal lakes in Finland using ordination and generalised additive modelling. Variation in macrophyte community composition of our lakes was related to water quality, land use, latitude and lake morphology. Relationships of macrophyte status metrics - the proportion of type-specific species (TT50), Percent Model Affinity (PMA) and Trophic Index (TI) - to land use were scale dependent. The proportion of agricultural and urban land use adjacent to the lake shoreline (LMZs of 300 m and 500 m) had a more significant effect on the metrics compared to land use at the catchment scale. The scale-related pattern in the effect of land use was not congruent among metrics and the metrics also showed different indications of deterioration. Lower sensitivity to the measured disturbance of the pressure sensitive metric TI compared to the other metrics (1150 and PMA) based on general type-specific species composition was presumably due to a lack of helophytes in the species pool used, and due to invariable indicator values across lake types. Moreover. TI varied more with hydromorphology related natural gradients than TT50 and PMA. This could be due to lack of habitat for eutrophication sensitive submerged indicator species in shallow lakes. Our study demonstrates that choosing the most influential catchment scale for the evaluation and mitigation of anthropogenic impacts on lacustrine biota, may be significant in conserving and restoring the ecological quality of freshwaters, as required by, e.g., the European Water Framework Directive.

AB The dynamic nature of coral reefs offers a rare opportunity to examine the response of ecosystems to disruption due to climate change. In 1998, the Great Barrier Reef experienced widespread coral bleaching and mortality. As a result, cryptobenthic fish assemblages underwent a dramatic phase-shift. Thirteen years, and up to 96 fish generations later, the cryptobenthic fish assemblage has not returned to its pre-bleach configuration. This is despite coral abundances returning to, or exceeding, pre-bleach values. The post-bleach fish assemblage exhibits no evidence of recovery. If these short-lived fish species are a model for their longer-lived counterparts, they suggest that (1) the full effects of the 1998 bleaching event on long-lived fish populations have yet to be seen, (2) it may take decades, or more, before recovery or regeneration of these long-lived species will begin, and (3) fish assemblages may not recover to their previous composition despite the return of corals.

AB Plants use a diverse mix of defenses against herbivores, including multiple secondary metabolites, which may affect herbivores synergistically. Chemical defenses also can affect natural enemies of herbivores via limiting herbivore populations or by affecting herbivore resistance or susceptibility to these enemies. In this study, we conducted larval feeding experiments to examine the potential synergistic effects of iridoid glycosides (IGs) found in Plantago spp. (Plantaginaceae) on the specialist buckeye caterpillar, Junonia coenia (Nymphalidae). Caterpillars were placed on artificial diets containing different concentrations of single IGs (aucubin or catalpol alone) or combinations of the two IGs. Larval performance and immune response were recorded to test the hypothesis that IGs would have positive synergistic effects on buckeyes, which are specialists on IG plants. The positive synergistic effects that IGs had on buckeyes in our experiments included lower mortality, faster development, and higher total iridoid glycoside sequestration on mixed diets than on aucubin- or catalpol-only diets. Furthermore, we found negative synergistic effects of IGs on the immune response of buckeye caterpillars. These results demonstrate multiple synergistic effects of IGs and indicate a potential trade-off between larval performance and parasitoid resistance.

AB Background: Patagonia extends for more than 84,000 km of irregular coasts is an area especially apt to evaluate how historic and contemporary processes influence the distribution and connectivity of shallow marine benthic organisms. The true limpet Nacella magellanica has a wide distribution in this province and represents a suitable model to infer the Quaternary glacial legacy on marine benthic organisms. This species inhabits ice-free rocky ecosystems, has a narrow bathymetric range and consequently should have been severely affected by recurrent glacial cycles during the Quaternary. We performed phylogeographic and demographic analyses of N. magellanica from 14 localities along its distribution in Pacific Patagonia, Atlantic Patagonia, and the Falkland/Malvinas Islands.
   Results: Mitochondrial (COI) DNA analyses of 357 individuals of N. magellanica revealed an absence of genetic differentiation in the species with a single genetic unit along Pacific Patagonia. However, we detected significant genetic differences among three main groups named Pacific Patagonia, Atlantic Patagonia and Falkland/Malvinas Islands. Migration rate estimations indicated asymmetrical gene flow, primarily from Pacific Patagonia to Atlantic Patagonia (N(e)m=2.21) and the Falkland/Malvinas Islands (N(e)m=16.6). Demographic reconstruction in Pacific Patagonia suggests a recent recolonization process (<10 ka) supported by neutrality tests, mismatch distribution and the median-joining haplotype genealogy.
   Conclusions: Absence of genetic structure, a single dominant haplotype, lack of correlation between geographic and genetic distance, high estimated migration rates and the signal of recent demographic growth represent a large body of evidence supporting the hypothesis of rapid postglacial expansion in this species in Pacific Patagonia. This expansion could have been sustained by larval dispersal following the main current system in this area. Lower levels of genetic diversity in inland sea areas suggest that fjords and channels represent the areas most recently colonized by the species. Hence recolonization seems to follow a west to east direction to areas that were progressively deglaciated. Significant genetic differences among Pacific, Atlantic and Falkland/Malvinas Islands populations may be also explained through disparities in their respective glaciological and geological histories. The Falkland/ Malvinas Islands, more than representing a glacial refugium for the species, seems to constitute a sink area considering the strong asymmetric gene flow detected from Pacific to Atlantic sectors. These results suggest that historical and contemporary processes represent the main factors shaping the modern biogeography of most shallow marine benthic invertebrates inhabiting the Patagonian Province.

SO ECOSYSTEM SERVICES
LA English
DT Article
DE Australia; Biodiversity; Ecosystem services; Governance; Institutions;
   Natural resources
AB We review the environmental challenges, cultures and institutions in Australia that have allowed the concept of ecosystem services to be tested and adapted. In some instance the nation has embraced the opportunities offered with ecosystem services forming the core of several large-scale reforms and collaborations that have considered dependence of humans on ecosystems. In other ways, however, the opportunities have been overlooked as Australia lacks effective institutions to consider human-environment interactions holistically and strategically. The term "ecosystem services" appears widely but it is mostly used superficially: often with reference to only a few services. The full suite of services, benefits and beneficiaries if humans and the natural environment are to coexist in the long-term have not been systematically included in decision making and management. Insights are distilled that may be useful in the application of ecosystem services in other parts of the world. Stable and well-funded regional natural resource and river basin management institutions have vital roles. Governance reforms at the national and state (provincial scales) are also needed to apply ecosystem service frameworks and improve accountability for implementation of policy agreements.

AB Soil food webs are important determinants for the carbon flow through terrestrial systems, with the trophic networks between microbes and microfaunal grazers forming the basis for processing plant resources. At an agricultural field site cropped with maize or wheat, plant carbon input to soil was experimentally manipulated by amendment with maize litter. The community structure of dominant micro-food web components, the bacteria, fungi, protozoa and nematodes, was investigated across a depth gradient comprising plough layer, rooted soil below plough horizon, and deeper root free soil. The community composition and diversity within micro-food webs, and the response to resource supply, were assessed in summer, the vegetation period with highest root exudation. In the plough layer amendment with plant residues increased microbial biomass as well as density of fan shaped amoeba morphotypes and of bacterial- and fungal-feeding nematodes. Diversity of food web assemblages was assessed by operational taxonomic units (OTU) for bacteria and fungi, protozoa morphotypes and nematode families. Changes in diversity were either not apparent (fungi, protozoa), negatively related to litter (bacteria) or positively linked to the presence of a specific crop plant (bacteria, nematodes). Based on nematode functional guilds and the related enrichment and structure index, general food web conditions were assigned as nutrient enriched, with a high degree of disturbance, and a dominance of the bacterial energy channel. In sum, litter amendment fostered the abundance but not the diversity of organisms as food webs remained bottom heavy with only small amounts of carbon conserved at higher trophic levels. Food web structure was more affected by the abiotic (soil profile) and biotic (crop plant) environment than by the supply with litter resources. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Southeast-Asia (SEA) constitutes a global biodiversity hotspot, but is exposed to extensive deforestation and faces numerous threats to its biodiversity. Climate change represents a major challenge to the survival and viability of species, and the potential consequences must be assessed to allow for mitigation. We project the effects of several climate change scenarios on bat diversity, and predict changes in range size for 171 bat species throughout SEA. We predict decreases in species richness in all areas with high species richness (>80 species) at 20502080, using bioclimatic IPCC scenarios A2 (a severe scenario, continuously increasing human population size, regional changes in economic growth) and B1 (the greenest scenario, global population peaking mid-century). We also predicted changes in species richness in scenarios that project vegetation changes in addition to climate change up to 2050. At 2050 and 2080, A2 and B1 scenarios incorporating changes in climatic factors predicted that 39% species would lose all currently suitable niche space. When considering total extents of species distribution in SEA (including possible range expansions), 26% of species may have no suitable niche space in 20502080. When potential vegetation and climate changes were combined only 1% of species showed no changes in their predicted ranges by 2050. Although some species are projected to expand ranges, this may be ecologically impossible due to potential barriers to dispersal, especially for species with poor dispersal ability. Only 113% of species showed no projected reductions in their current range under bioclimatic scenarios. An effective way to facilitate range shift for dispersal-limited species is to improve landscape connectivity. If current trends in environmental change continue and species cannot expand their ranges into new areas, then the majority of bat species in SEA may show decreases in range size and increased extinction risk within the next century.

AB There is now abundant evidence that contemporary climatic change has indirectly affected a wide-range of species by changing trophic interactions, competition, epidemiology and habitat. However, direct physiological impacts of changing climates are rarely reported for endothermic species, despite being commonly reported for ectotherms. We review the evidence for changing physiological constraints on endothermic vertebrates at high temperatures, integrating theoretical and empirical perspectives on the morphology, physiology and behavior of marine birds. Potential for increasing heat stress exposure depends on changes in multiple environmental variables, not just air temperature, as well as organism-specific morphology, physiology and behavior. Endotherms breeding at high latitudes are vulnerable to the forecast, extensive temperature changes because of the adaptations they possess to minimize heat loss. Low-latitude species will also be challenged as they currently live close to their thermal limits and will likely suffer future water shortages. Small, highly-active species, particularly aerial foragers, are acutely vulnerable as they are least able to dissipate heat at high temperatures. Overall, direct physiological impacts of climatic change appear underrepresented in the published literature, but available data suggest they have much potential to shape behavior, morphology and distribution of endothermic species. Coincidence between future heat stress events and other energetic constraints on endotherms remains largely unexplored but will be key in determining the physiological impacts of climatic change. Multi-scale, biophysical modeling, informed by experiments that quantify thermoregulatory responses of endotherms to heat stress, is an essential precursor to urgently-needed analyses at the population or species level.

Snakes may represent ideal model organisms relative to other animal groups for addressing such resource dependency, due to a presumably more direct link between food resources and many aspects of behavior and natural history. We experimentally investigated the relationship between food intake and spatial behavior in a population of the snake Bothrops asper in a Costa Rican lowland rainforest. Six adult snakes were allowed to forage naturally while six were offered supplemental food in the field, with both groups monitored using radiotelemetry. Mean home range size did not differ between groups presumably due to small sample size, but supplementally fed snakes demonstrated altered patterns of macro- and microhabitat selection, shorter and less frequent movements, and increased mass acquisition. Fed snakes also devoted less time to foraging efforts, instead more frequently remaining inactive and utilizing shelter. Because snakes were always fed in situ and not at designated feeding stations, observed shifts in habitat selection are not explained by animals simply moving to areas of higher food availability. Rather. B. asper may have moved to swamps in order to feed on amphibians when necessary, but remained in preferred forest habitat when food was otherwise abundant. The strong behavioral and spatiotemporal responses of snakes in this population may have been influenced by an overall scarcity of mammalian prey during the study period. (C) 2012 Elsevier GmbH.

AB The aim of our study was to test the robustness and efficiency of maximum likelihood with respect to different long branch effects on multiple-taxon trees. We simulated data of different alignment lengths under two different 11-taxon trees and a broad range of different branch length conditions. The data were analyzed with the true model parameters as well as with estimated and incorrect assumptions about among-site rate variation. If length differences between connected branches strongly increase, tree inference with the correct likelihood model assumptions can fail. We found that incorporating invariant sites together with Gamma distributed site rates in the tree reconstruction (Gamma+I) increases the robustness of maximum likelihood in comparison with models using only Gamma. The results show that for some topologies and branch lengths the reconstruction success of maximum likelihood under the correct model is still low for alignments with a length of 100,000 base positions. Altogether, the high confidence that is put in maximum likelihood trees is not always justified under certain tree shapes even if alignment lengths reach 100,000 base positions.

AB The unparalleled diversity of tropical ecosystems like the Amazon Basin has been traditionally explained using spatial models within the context of climatic and geological history. Yet, it is adaptive genetic diversity that defines how species evolve and interact within an ecosystem. Here, we combine genome scans, population genetics and sequence-based phylogeographic analyses to examine spatial and ecological arrangements of selected and neutrally evolving regions of the genome of an Amazonian fish, Triportheus albus. Using a sampling design encompassing five major Amazonian rivers, three hydrochemical settings, 352 nuclear markers and two mitochondrial DNA genes, we assess the influence of environmental gradients as biodiversity drivers in Amazonia. We identify strong divergent natural selection with gene flow and isolation by environment across craton (black and clear colour)- and Andean (white colour)-derived water types. Furthermore, we find that heightened selection and population genetic structure present at the interface of these water types appears more powerful in generating diversity than the spatial arrangement of river systems and vicariant biogeographic history. The results from our study challenge assumptions about the origin and distribution of adaptive and neutral genetic diversity in tropical ecosystems. In addition, they have important implications for measures of biodiversity and evolutionary potential in one of the worlds most diverse and iconic ecosystems.

AB Many trees species form symbiotic associations with ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi, which improve nutrient and water acquisition of their host. Until now it is unclear whether the species richness of ECM fungi is beneficial for tree seedling performance, be it during moist conditions or drought. We performed a pot experiment using Pinus sylvestris seedlings inoculated with four selected ECM fungi (Cenococcum geophilum, Paxillus involutus, Rhizopogon roseolus and Suillus granulatus) to investigate (i) whether these four ECM fungi, in monoculture or in species mixtures, affect growth of P. sylvestris seedlings, and (ii) whether this effect can be attributed to species number per se or to species identity. Two different watering regimes (moist vs. dry) were applied to examine the context-dependency of the results. Additionally, we assessed the activity of eight extracellular enzymes in the root tips. Shoot growth was enhanced in the presence of S. granulatus, but not by any other ECM fungal species. The positive effect of S. granulatus on shoot growth was more pronounced under moist (threefold increase) than under dry conditions (twofold increase), indicating that the investigated ECM fungi did not provide additional support during drought stress. The activity of secreted extracellular enzymes was higher in S. granulatus than in any other species. In conclusion, our findings suggest that ECM fungal species composition may affect seedling performance in terms of aboveground biomass.

AB Background: Majority of the tiger habitat in Indian subcontinent lies within high human density landscapes and is highly sensitive to surrounding pressures. These forests are unable to sustain healthy tiger populations within a tiger-hostile matrix, despite considerable conservation efforts. Ranthambore Tiger Reserve (RTR) in Northwest India is one such isolated forest which is rapidly losing its links with other tiger territories in the Central Indian landscape. Non-invasive genetic sampling for individual identification is a potent technique to understand the relationships between threatened tiger populations in degraded habitats. This study is an attempt to establish tiger movement across a fragmented landscape between RTR and its neighboring forests, Kuno-Palpur Wildlife Sanctuary (KPWLS) and Madhav National Park (MNP) based on non-invasively obtained genetic data.
   Methods: Data from twelve microsatellite loci was used to define population structure and also to identify first generation migrants and admixed individuals in the above forests.
   Results: Population structure was consistent with the Central Indian landscape and we could determine significant gene flow between RTR and MNP. We could identify individuals of admixed ancestry in both these forests, as well as first generation migrants from RTR to KPWLS and MNP.
   Conclusions: Our results indicate reproductive mixing between animals of RTR and MNP in the recent past and migration of animals even today, despite fragmentation and poaching risk, from RTR towards MNP. Substantial conservation efforts should be made to maintain connectivity between these two subpopulations and also higher protection status should be conferred on Madhav National Park.

AB Forensic entomology is an inferential science because postmortem interval estimates are based on the extrapolation of results obtained in field or laboratory settings. Although enormous gains in scientific understanding and methodological practice have been made in forensic entomology over the last few decades, a majority of the field studies we reviewed do not meet the standards for inference, which are 1) adequate replication, 2) independence of experimental units, and 3) experimental conditions that capture a representative range of natural variability. Using a mock case-study approach, we identify design flaws in field and lab experiments and suggest methodological solutions for increasing inference strength that can inform future casework. Suggestions for improving data reporting in future field studies are also proposed.

AB 'Neutral' environmental outcomes in terms of energy use, carbon emissions, waste generation or water use are worthy but difficult targets in architectural and urban design. However, the built environment may need to go beyond efforts simply to limit negative environmental outcomes and instead aim for net positive environmental benefits. This implies that the built environment would need to contribute more than it consumes while simultaneously remediating past and current environmental damage. Such development could be termed 'regenerative'. The potential for understanding and then mimicking ecosystem services is explored for setting goals for regenerative developments, designing them and measuring their successes or failures as they evolve over time. Key leverage points are identified where the systems of the built environment may be changed in order to move towards a regenerative urban environment. Analysing the urban built environment from the perspective of how ecosystems function could be a significant step towards the creation of a built environment where positive integration with, and restoration of, local ecosystems may be realized.

AB We present a high-coverage draft genome assembly of the aye-aye (Daubentonia madagascariensis), a highly unusual nocturnal primate from Madagascar. Our assembly totals; similar to 3.0 billion bp (3.0 Gb), roughly the size of the human genome, comprised of similar to 2.6 million scaffolds (N50 scaffold size = 13,597 bp) based on short paired-end sequencing reads. We compared the aye-aye genome sequence data with four other published primate genomes (human, chimpanzee, orangutan, and rhesus macaque) as well as with the mouse and dog genomes as nonprimate outgroups. Unexpectedly, we observed strong evidence for a relatively slow substitution rate in the aye-aye lineage compared with these and other primates. In fact, the aye-aye branch length is estimated to be similar to 10% shorter than that of the human lineage, which is known for its low substitution rate. This finding may be explained, in part, by the protracted aye-aye life-history pattern, including late weaning and age of first reproduction relative to other lemurs. Additionally, the availability of this draft lemur genome sequence allowed us to polarize nucleotide and protein sequence changes to the ancestral primate lineage-a critical period in primate evolution, for which the relevant fossil record is sparse. Finally, we identified 293,800 high-confidence single nucleotide polymorphisms in the donor individual for our aye-aye genome sequence, a captive-born individual from two wild-born parents. The resulting heterozygosity estimate of 0.051% is the lowest of any primate studied to date, which is understandable considering the aye-aye's extensive home-range size and relatively low population densities. Yet this level of genetic diversity also suggests that conservation efforts benefiting this unusual species should be prioritized, especially in the face of the accelerating degradation and fragmentation of Madagascar's forests.

AB It is a widely held assumption that populations historically restricted to mountain refugia tend to exhibit high levels of genetic diversity and deep coalescent histories, whereas populations distributed in surrounding low-lying regions tend to be genetically depauperate following recent expansion from refugia. These predicted genetic patterns are based largely on our understanding of glaciation history in Northern Hemisphere systems, yet remain poorly tested in analogous Southern Hemisphere arid systems because few examples in the literature allow the comparison of widespread taxa distributed across mountain and desert biomes. We demonstrate with multiple datasets from Australian geckos that topographically complex mountain regions harbor high nucleotide diversity, up to 18 times higher than that of the surrounding desert lowlands. We further demonstrate that taxa in topographically complex areas have older coalescent histories than those in the geologically younger deserts, and that both ancient and more recent aridification events have contributed to these patterns. Our results show that, despite differences in the details of climate and landscape changes that occurred in the Northern and Southern hemispheres (ice-sheets versus aridification), similar patterns emerge that illustrate the profound influence of the Pleistocene on contemporary genetic structure.

TI Climate Change and American Bullfrog Invasion: What Could We Expect in

DT Article

   NICHE; PREDICTION; POPULATIONS; AMPHIBIANS; IMPACTS; RANGES; SHIFTS
AB Background: Biological invasion and climate change pose challenges to biodiversity conservation in the 21(st) century. Invasive species modify ecosystem structure and functioning and climatic changes are likely to produce invasive species' range shifts pushing some populations into protected areas. The American Bullfrog (Lithobates catesbeianus) is one of the hundred worst invasive species in the world. Native from the southeast of USA, it has colonized more than 75% of South America where it has been reported as a highly effective predator, competitor and vector of amphibian diseases.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: We modeled the potential distribution of the bullfrog in its native range based on different climate models and green-house gases emission scenarios, and projected the results onto South America for the years of 2050 and 2080. We also overlaid projected models onto the South American network of protected areas. Our results indicate a slight decrease in potential suitable area for bullfrog invasion, although protected areas will become more climatically suitable. Therefore, invasion of these sites is forecasted.
   Conclusion/Significance: We provide new evidence supporting the vulnerability of the Atlantic Forest Biodiversity Hotspot to bullfrog invasion and call attention to optimal future climatic conditions of the Andean-Patagonian forest, eastern Paraguay, and northwestern Bolivia, where invasive populations have not been found yet. We recommend several management and policy strategies to control bullfrog invasion and argue that these would be possible if based on appropriate articulation among government agencies, NGOs, research institutions and civil society.

AB Management agencies and quantitative ecologists need robust estimates of population density. The best way of converting population estimates of livetrapped small mammals to population density is not clear. We estimated population density on livetrapping grids with 4 estimators applied to 3 species of boreal forest and 3 species of tundra rodents to test for relative differences in density estimators. We used 2 spatial estimators proposed by Efford (2009) and 2 traditional boundary-strip estimators designed for grid livetrapping. We analyzed mark-recapture data from 104 trapping sessions from the boreal forest at Kluane, Yukon (n = 4,818 individuals), and 56 trapping sessions from tundra areas of Herschel Island and Komakuk Beach in northern Yukon (n = 1,327 individuals). For boreal forest rodents on average both boundary-strip methods produced density estimates larger than Efford's maximum-likelihood (ML) estimator by as much as 50% at all population densities up to 25 animals/ha. For tundra rodents both boundary-strip methods produced density estimates smaller than Efford's ML at low density (<1.5/ha) and larger than Efford's ML density by 36-63% at high density (25/ha). Efford's inverse prediction estimator produced larger density estimates than the ML estimator by 4% for the boreal forest and 32% for the tundra rodents. Relationships were high between all the estimators, such that trends in density could be inferred from all methods. Determining the bias in population density estimators in small mammals will require data from populations spatially closed and completely enumerated. For our small mammals Efford's ML estimator typically provided density estimates smaller than those produced by conventional boundary-strip estimators.

SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY

DT Article
DE Biogeochemical cycles; Ecosystem services; Water; Carbon; Nitrogen
ID CLASSIFICATION
AB Ecosystem services (ES) are provided by healthy ecosystems and are fundamental to support human life. However, natural systems have been degraded all over the world and the process of degradation is partially attributed to the lack of knowledge regarding the economic benefits associated with ES, which usually are not captured in the market. To valuate ES without using conventional approaches, such as the human's willingness-to-pay for ecosystem goods and services, this paper uses a different method based on Energy Systems Theory to estimate prices for biogeochemical flows that affect ecosystem services by considering their emergy content converted to equivalent monetary terms. Ecosystem services related to water, carbon and nitrogen biogeochemical flows were assessed since they are connected to a range of final ecosystem services including climate regulation, hydrological regulation, food production, soil formation and others. Results in this paper indicate that aquifer recharge, groundwater flow, carbon dioxide sequestration, methane emission, biological nitrogen fixation, nitrous oxide emission and nitrogen leaching/runoff are the most critical biogeochemical flows in terrestrial systems. Moreover, monetary values related to biogeochemical flows on a global scale could provide important information for policymakers concerned with payment mechanisms for ecosystem services and costs of greenhouse gas emissions.

AB The use of data provided by fishers is a contentious topic in fishery management. We compare fisher local ecological knowledge, fisher catch data and scientific data for Murray crayfish (Euastacus armatus) size and sex ratios in the River Murray, Australia, to determine if these data are consistent and if fisher knowledge can be a reliable input into fisheries management. Data were obtained through field surveys of crayfish populations, face-to-face fisher interviews and catch cards completed by fishers. All data sources indicated that there were higher numbers of crayfish <90 mm OCL compared to >= 90 mm OCL and the sex ratio of larger crayfish (>= 90 mm OCL) was skewed towards females. Fisher catch card and scientific survey data showed the size frequencies of male and female crayfish were significantly different. Study results suggest that fisher local ecological knowledge can be a reliable source of information to improve fisheries management. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Asexual organisms are confronted with substantial drawbacks, both immediate and delayed, threatening their evolutionary persistence. Yet, genetic associations with asexuality may refresh the gene pool promoting adaptation of clonal lineages; polyploidy is one of them. Parthenogenesis itself and/or polyploidy are responsible for the maintenance and spread of clones in Artemia, a sexual-asexual genus of halophilic anostracans. We applied flow cytometry, microsatellite genotyping, and mtDNA sequencing to 23 asexual populations. Artemia parthenogens have evolved multiple times either through hybridization or spontaneously. Nine out of 23 populations contained clones of mixed ploidy (2n, 3n, 4n). Most clones were diploid (20/31) while two and nine clones were triploid and tetraploid, respectively. Apomictic triploids and tetraploids formed two distinct groups of low genetic diversity compared with the more divergent automictic diploids. Polyploidy is also polyphyletic in Artemia, with triploids and tetraploids having independent origins from different sexual ancestors. We discern a pattern of geographical parthenogenesis with all clonal groups being more widespread than their closest sexuals. In favour of a specialist model, asexual diploids are restricted to single locations and are strikingly segregated from generalist triploids and tetraploids occupying a variety of sites. This is a rare pattern of mixed life-history strategies within an asexual complex. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The Antarctic region is renowned for its isolated, unusual, diverse, and disharmonic marine fauna. Holothuroids are especially diverse, with 187 species (including 51 that are undescribed) recorded south of the Antarctic Convergence. This represents similar to 4% of the documented Antarctic marine biota, and similar to 10% of the world's holothuroid diversity. We present evidence that both inter-regional speciation with southern cold-temperate regions and intra-regional diversification has contributed to species richness. The Antarctic fauna is isolated, with few shallow-water Antarctic species known from north of the Convergence, yet several species show recent transgression of this boundary followed by genetic divergence. Interchange at longer time scales is evidenced by the scarcity of endemic genera (10 of 55) and occurrence of all six holothuroid orders within the region. While most Antarctic holothuroid morphospecies have circum-polar distributions, mtDNA sequence data demonstrate substantial geographic differentiation in many of these. Thus, most of the 37 holothuroid species recorded from shelf/slope depths in the Weddell Sea have also been found in collections from Prydz Bay and the Ross Sea. Yet 17 of 28 morphospecies and complexes studied show allopatric differentiation around the continent, on average into three divergent lineages each, suggesting that morphological data fails to reflect the level of differentiation. Interchange and local radiation of colonizers appear to have rapidly built diversity in the Antarctic, despite the potential of cold temperatures (and associated long generation times) to slow the rate of evolution.

AB Winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L. cv. Kenong9204) was grown in open top chambers with either ambient or elevated CO2 concentrations (358 +/- 19 mu mol mol(-1) or 712 +/- 22 mu mol mol(-1), respectively) in well-watered or drought conditions. Although elevated CO2 did not significantly affect the height of the plants at harvest, it significantly increased the aboveground biomass by 10.1% and the root/shoot ratio by 16.0%. Elevated CO2 also significantly increased the grain yield (GY) by 6.7% when well-watered and by 10.4% when drought stressed. Specifically, in the well-watered condition, this increase was due to a greater number of ears (8.7% more) and kernels (8.6). In the drought condition, it was only due to a greater number of spikes (17.1% more). In addition, elevated CO2 also significantly increased the water use efficiency (WUE) of the plants by 9.9% when well-watered and by 13.8% under drought conditions, even though the evapotranspiration (ET) of the plants did not change significantly. Elevated CO2 also significantly increased the root length in the top half of the soil profile by 35.4% when well-watered and by 44.7% under drought conditions. Finally, elevated CO2 significantly increased the root water uptake by 52.9% when well-watered and by 10.1% under drought conditions. These results suggest that (1) future increases in atmospheric CO2 concentration may have a significant effect on wheat production in arid and semiarid areas where wheat cultivation requires upland cropping or deficit irrigation; (2) wheat cultivars can be developed to have more tillers and kernels through selective breeding and field management; and (3) fertilizer and water management in topsoil will become increasingly important as atmospheric CO2 concentration rises.

AB The successful use of macroinvertebrates as indicators of stream condition in bioassessments has led to heightened interest throughout the scientific community in the prediction of stream condition. For example, predictive models are increasingly being developed that use measures of watershed disturbance, including urban and agricultural land-use, as explanatory variables to predict various metrics of biological condition such as richness, tolerance, percent predators, index of biotic integrity, functional species traits, or even ordination axes scores. Our primary intent was to determine if effective models could be developed using watershed characteristics of disturbance to predict macroinvertebrate metrics among disparate and widely separated ecoregions. We aggregated macroinvertebrate data from universities and state and federal agencies in order to assemble stream data sets of high enough density appropriate for modeling in three distinct ecoregions in Oregon and California. Extensive review and quality assurance of macroinvertebrate sampling protocols, laboratory subsample counts and taxonomic resolution was completed to assure data comparability. We used widely available digital coverages of land-use and land-cover data summarized at the watershed and riparian scale as explanatory variables to predict macroinvertebrate metrics commonly used by state resource managers to assess stream condition. The "best" multiple linear regression models from each region required only two or three explanatory variables to model macroinvertebrate metrics and explained 41-74% of the variation. In each region the best model contained some measure of urban and/or agricultural land-use, yet often the model was improved by including a natural explanatory variable such as mean annual precipitation or mean watershed slope. Two macroinvertebrate metrics were common among all three regions, the metric that summarizes the richness of tolerant macroinvertebrates (RICHTOL) and some form of Err (Ephemeroptera. Plecoptera, and Trichoptera) richness. Best models were developed for the same two invertebrate metrics even though the geographic regions reflect distinct differences in precipitation, geology, elevation, slope, population density, and land-use. With further development, models like these call be used to elicit better causal linkages to stream biological attributes or condition and call be used by researchers or managers to predict biological indicators of stream condition at unsampled sites.

AB There have been many substantial advances in our knowledge of Australasian freshwater turtle biodiversity in the last three decades, but the classification of genera and species is in dire need of review. The proliferation of names in unpublished manuscripts and in taxonomic works published in ephemeral (often privately printed) magazines, journals or books, without the benefits of peer review and often with little justification and scant diagnoses, many of which are not allowable nomenclatural actions under the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature, has led to considerable confusion. Taxonomy is punctuated by timely and rigorous revisions that bring a check on the proliferation of names for unsubstantiated taxa. This paper is not a comprehensive revision, but in it we provide an assessment of the current taxonomy of Australasian freshwater turtles, focusing on information available to establish the validity of taxa as biological entities (as opposed to the validity of the names). We include an annotated list of species, an outline of the taxonomic issues for those taxa that are controversial (leading in some cases to synonymies), keys to the identification of genera and species, and updated information on their distributions. We call upon the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature to incorporate effective measures into the Code to prevent the destabilizing influence of the proliferation of names for taxa that have not been established as real biological entities through the normal processes of peer reviewed publication. The provision by the ICZN of a list of journals in which nomenclatural acts must appear in order to be valid, in addition to meeting the other provisions of the Code, is suggested as such a measure. Without such action, destabilization of our taxonomy will continue, the traditional Linnaean binominal nomenclature will be undermined, and credibility will build for other forms of nomenclature that are on a firmer scientific footing, but in other ways inferior.

AB Understanding the relative influence of environmental and spatial variables in driving variation in species diversity and composition is an important and growing area of ecological research. We examined how fire, local vegetation structure and landscape configuration interact to influence dung beetle communities in Amazonian savannas, using both hierarchical partitioning and variance partitioning techniques to quantify independent effects. We captured a total of 3,334 dung beetles from 15 species at 22 savanna plots in 2003. The species accumulation curve was close to reaching an asymptote at a regional scale, but curves were variable at the plot level where total abundance ranged from 17 to 410 individuals. Most plots were dominated by just three species that accounted for 87.7% of all individuals sampled. Hierarchical partitioning revealed the strong independent and positive effect of percentage forest cover in the surrounding landscape on total dung beetle abundance and species richness, and richness of uncommon species and the tunneler guild. Forest cover also had a negative effect on community evenness. None of the variables that related to fire affected community metrics. The minimal direct influence of fire was supported by variance partitioning: partialling out the influence of spatial position and vegetation removed all of the individual explanation attributable to fire, whereas 8% of the variance was explained by vegetation and 28% was explained by spatial variables (when partialling out effects of the other two variables). Space-fire and vegetation-fire joint effects explained 14 and 10% of the dung beetle community variability, respectively. These results suggest that much of the variation in dung beetle assemblages in savannas can be attributed to the spatial location of sites, forest cover (which increased the occurrence of uncommon species), and the indirect effects of fires on vegetation (that was also dependent on spatial location). Our study also highlights the utility of partitioning techniques for examining the importance of environment variables such as fire that can be strongly influenced by spatial location.

AB Knowledge of the range, behavior, and feeding habits of large carnivores is fundamental to their successful conservation. Traditionally, the best method to obtain feeding data is through continuous observation, which is not always feasible. Reliable automated methods are needed to obtain sample sizes sufficient for statistical inference. Identification of large carnivore kill sites using Global Positioning System (GPS) data is gaining popularity. We assessed performance of generalized linear regression models (GLM) versus classification trees (CT) in a multipredator, multiprey African savanna ecosystem. We applied GLMs and CTs to various combinations of distance-traveled data, cluster durations, and environmental factors to predict occurrence of 234 female African lion (Panthera leo) kill sites from 1,477 investigated GPS clusters. Ratio of distance moved 24 hours before versus 24 hours after a cluster was the most important predictor variable in both GLM and CT analysis. In all cases, GLMs outperformed our cost-complexity-pruned CTs in their discriminative ability to separate kill from nonkill sites. Generalized linear models provided a good framework for kill-site identification that incorporates a hierarchal ordering of cluster investigation and measures to assess trade-offs between classification accuracy and time constraints. Implementation of GLMs within an adaptive sampling framework can considerably increase efficiency of locating kill sites, providing a cost-effective method for increasing sample sizes of kill data.

AB Background: While males usually benefit from as many matings as possible, females often evolve various methods of resistance to matings. The prevalent explanation for this is that the cost of additional matings exceeds the benefits of receiving sperm from a large number of males. Here we demonstrate, however, a strongly deviating pattern of polyandry.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: We analysed paternity in the marine snail Littorina saxatilis by genotyping large clutches (53-79) of offspring from four females sampled in their natural habitats. We found evidence of extreme promiscuity with 15-23 males having sired the offspring of each female within the same mating period.
   Conclusions/Significance: Such a high level of promiscuity has previously only been observed in a few species of social insects. We argue that genetic bet-hedging (as has been suggested earlier) is unlikely to explain such extreme polyandry. Instead we propose that these high levels are examples of convenience polyandry: females accept high numbers of matings if costs of refusing males are higher than costs of accepting superfluous matings.

AB The population status of the harbour porpoise (Phocoena phocoena) in the Baltic area has been a continuous matter of debate. Here we present the by far most comprehensive genetic population structure assessment to date for this region, both with regard to geographic coverage and sample size: 497 porpoise samples from North Sea, Skagerrak, Kattegat, Belt Sea, and Inner Baltic Sea were sequenced at the mitochondrial Control Region and 305 of these specimens were typed at 15 polymorphic microsatellite loci. Samples were stratified according to sample type (stranding vs. by-caught), sex, and season (breeding vs. non-breeding season). Our data provide ample evidence for a population split between the Skagerrak and the Belt Sea, with a transition zone in the Kattegat area. Among other measures, this was particularly visible in significant frequency shifts of the most abundant mitochondrial haplotypes. A particular haplotype almost absent in the North Sea was the most abundant in Belt Sea and Inner Baltic Sea. Microsatellites yielded a similar pattern (i.e., turnover in occurrence of clusters identified by STRUCTURE). Moreover, a highly significant association between microsatellite assignment and unlinked mitochondrial haplotypes further indicates a split between North Sea and Baltic porpoises. For the Inner Baltic Sea, we consistently recovered a small, but significant separation from the Belt Sea population. Despite recent arguments that separation should exceed a predefined threshold before populations shall be managed separately, we argue in favour of precautionary acknowledging the Inner Baltic porpoises as a separate management unit, which should receive particular attention, as it is threatened by various factors, in particular local fishery measures.

AB There is increasing evidence of linkages between biodiversity and ecosystem functions. Recent interests on this topic have expanded from an individual-function perspective to a multifunction perspective. This study aims to explore the soil bacterial diversity-multifunctionality relationship.
   Soil bacterial diversity was determined using culture-independent molecular techniques. Bacterial taxa groups with positive effects on certain ecosystem functions were identified by aggregated boosted tree analysis with a prediction-error-based backward-elimination criterion. Soil bacterial diversity-multifunctionality relationship was examined by exploring the relationship between the number of ecosystem functions and the number of soil bacterial taxa.
   More ecosystem functions would require greater numbers of bacterial taxa, which can be explained potentially using the multifunctional complementarity mechanism. Furthermore, a power law equation, OTU (N) = OTU1(N) (T) , was firstly proposed to describe the observed positive relationship between the soil bacterial diversity and the ecosystem multifunctionality, where OTU (N) is the number of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) required by N functions, while OTU1 is the average number of species required for one function, and T is the average turnover rate of OTU across functions.
   The number of ecosystem functions would decrease with the loss of soil bacterial diversity. This biodiversity-multifunctionality relationship has an important implication for comprehensively understanding the risk of bacterial diversity loss in relation to the ecosystem functions.

AB The effect of N availability on photosynthetic capacity, growth parameters and yield was studied in field-grown durum-wheat plants at both the leaf and canopy levels. Two contrasting nitrogen levels (120 and 0 kg ha(-1)) were assayed in a randomised block design with nine replicates each. Total biomass was measured at anthesis and yield and its agronomical components at maturity. Photosynthetic measurements were performed 2 weeks after anthesis in two plots of each N treatment. Flag leaves were measured, using a LI-COR 6400 combined with the chlorophyll fluorescence meter, and the whole canopy by measuring CO(2) and H(2)O fluxes in an innovative canopy-chamber system. We showed a clear increase in photosynthetic gas exchange and chlorophyll contents with N fertilisation at both canopy and leaf levels. As a consequence the increase in yield as response to N fertilisation seems the result of a larger green leaf area combined with a higher photosynthetic capacity of the leaves attributable to an increase in the maximum carboxylation velocity of Rubisco. Moreover gas-exchange measurements of the flag leaf during grain filling seem to provide a realistic characterisation, not just of the photosynthetic performance of the crop, but also about the impact of N availability oil yield. Thus, measurements performed on the flag leaf matched those at the canopy level, with proportional increases in terms of gas exchange and chlorophyll content, providing a fast, cheap and reliable estimation of canopy photosynthesis and the grain yield attained by the crop.

AB Capsule A first-time observer effect in the new French breeding bird survey (BBS) was found to result from new observers learning how to use the point count method on randomly selected sites.
   Aims To estimate the first-year effect in a newly started BBS, to look for correlates and test for a temporal trend in learning.
   Methods Trends of 105 species were estimated using data from 2001-2007 obtained by I 100 observers conducting point counts over 1535 randomly selected squares. I estimated the average increase in detected numbers between the first and all subsequent years of survey at a site.
   Results Observers counted 4.3% more birds in subsequent years than during the initial year of survey. This first-year effect decreased from 2001 to 2007 (by an average of 2% per year). It was not related to most variables known to influence species defection probability. Only species with songs of lower sound frequencies (ranging from 0.5 to 8 kHz here) displayed a greater increase in locally detected numbers.
   Conclusion The detected first-year effect was the result of method learning by new observers who had not previously conducted point counts or visited randomly selected sites. The learning effect was larger for species with songs of lower sound frequency which are harder to hear during the dawn chorus.

AB Species distribution modelling has emerged as a tool both for exploring niche theory and for producing distribution maps for management. To understand and predict potential effects of large scale habitat change there is a need for proper model validation and applicability also in unstudied areas. However, knowledge about factors influencing the transferability of distribution models, i.e. the accuracy of the models when applying them in a new geographical area, is limited. We have successfully modelled the larval distribution of two fish species, northern pike (Esox lucius L) and roach (Rutilus rutilus L.), on a regional scale in the Baltic Sea using a few and easily measured environmental variables. When models were transferred from the training area to the testing area the models showed reasonable to very good discrimination (ROC 0.75 and 0.93) based on external validation using independent data separated also in time (1-2 years). The predicted larval distribution also overlapped with the distribution of young-of-the-year fish later in the season. Performance when reversing the transfer, by constructing the models in the testing area and predicting back to the original training area, was less successful. This discrepancy was species-specific and could be explained by differences in the species presence ranges along the predictor variables in the testing area compared to the training area. Our results illustrate how transferability success can be influenced by area-specific differences in the range of the predictor variables and show the necessity of validating model predictions properly.

AB In temperate and arid climate zones many streams and rivers flow intermittently, seasonally contracting to a sequence of isolated pools or waterholes over the dry period, before reconnecting in the wetter parts of the year. This seasonal drying process is central to our understanding of the population dynamics of aquatic organisms such as fish and invertebrates in these systems. However, there is a dearth of empirical data on the temporal dynamics of such populations. We describe a spatially explicit individual-based model (SEIBM) of fish population dynamics in such systems, which we use to explore the long-term population viability of the carp gudgeon Hypseleotris spp. in a lowland stream in southeastern Australia. We explicitly consider the impacts of interannual variability in stream flow, for example, due to drought, on habitat availability and hence population persistence. Our results support observations that these populations are naturally highly variable, with simulated fish population sizes typically varying over four orders of magnitude within a 50-year simulation run. The most sensitive parameters in the model relate to the amount of water (habitat) in the system: annual rainfall, seepage loss from the pools, and the carrying capacity (number of individuals per cubic meter) of the pools as they dry down. It seems likely that temporal source-sink dynamics allow the fish populations to persist in these systems, with good years (high rainfall and brief cease-to-flow [CTF] periods) buffering against periods of drought. In dry years during which the stream may contract to very low numbers of pools, each of these persistent pools becomes crucial for the persistence of the population in the system. Climate change projections for this area suggest decreases in rainfall and increased incidence of drought; under these environmental conditions the long-term persistence of these fish populations is uncertain.

AB Rapid evolutionary adjustments to novel environments may contribute to the successful spread of invasive species, and can lead to niche shifts making range dynamics unpredictable. These effects might be intensified by artificial selection in the course of breeding efforts, since many successful plant invaders were deliberately introduced and cultivated as ornamentals. We hypothesized that the invasion success of Buddleja davidii, the ornamental butterfly bush, is facilitated by local adaptation to minimum temperatures and thus, exhibits unpredictable range dynamics. To assess the potential effects of adaptive evolution and artificial selection on the spread of B. davidii, we combined a common garden experiment investigating local adaptation to frost, with ecological niche modelling of the species' native and invasive ranges. We expected that populations naturalized in sub-continental climate are less susceptible to frost than populations from oceanic climate, and that the invasive range does not match predictions based on climatic data from the native range. Indeed, we revealed significant variation among invasive B. davidii populations in frost resistance. However, frost hardiness was not related to geographic location or climatic variables of the populations' home site, suggesting that invasive B. davidii populations are not locally adapted to minimum temperatures. This is in line with results of our ecological niche model that did not detect a niche shift between the species' native range in China, and its invasive range in Europe and North America. Furthermore, our niche model showed that the potential invasive range of B. davidii is still not completely occupied. Together with the frost resistance data obtained in our experiment, the results indicate that climatic conditions are currently not limiting the further spread of the species in Europe and North America.

AB Previous analyses of SeaWiFS ocean color and hydrographic data [Ji, R., Davis, C. S., Chen, C. et al. (2007) Influence of ocean freshening on shelf phytoplankton dynamics. Geophys. Res. Lett., 34, L24607. doi: 10.1029/2007GL032010] have suggested that changes in the intensity of low-salinity Scotian Shelf Water (SSW) inflow can significantly influence the winter-spring phytoplankton dynamics in the Scotian Shelf and Gulf of Maine region. In the present study, a 3-D coupled biological-physical model was applied to examine underlying mechanisms through a quantitative comparison of circulation pattern, water column stability, nutrient/phytoplankton concentrations and net primary productivity between low and high freshening scenarios. The model results revealed that observed levels of surface freshening can significantly change water column stability and therefore control the winter-spring phytoplankton bloom dynamics in different regions. Freshening caused earlier blooms both on the Scotian Shelf and in the eastern Gulf of Maine, agreeing with inferences drawn from prior empirical analyses. Earlier phytoplankton blooms in the low surface salinity case were followed by earlier depletion of nutrients at the surface along with earlier decline of blooms compared with the high surface salinity case. The model results also suggested that surface water freshening can impede vertical nutrient exchange between surface and deep waters, thus reducing the overall spring primary productivity throughout the region. The coupled model described in this study provides a unique tool to quantify the response of lower trophic level production to climate-scale environmental disturbances in a complex but ecologically important shelf ecosystem that has a history of such alternations in surface salinity.

AB Although enhancing reserve shape has been suggested as an alternative to enlarging nature reserves, the importance of reserve shape relative to reserve area remains unclear. Here we examined the relative importance of area and shape of forest patches to species richness, species composition, and species abundance (abundance of each species) for 3 taxa (33 birds, 41 butterflies, and 91 forest-floor plants) in a fragmented landscape in central Hokkaido, northern Japan. We grouped the species according to their potential edge responses (interior-, neutral-, and edge-species groups for birds and forest-floor plants, woodland- and open-land-species groups for butterflies) and analyzed them separately. We used a shape index that was independent of area as an index of shape circularization. Hierarchical partitioning and variation partitioning revealed that patch area was generally more important than patch shape for species richness and species composition of birds and butterflies. For forest-floor plants, effects of patch area and shape were small, whereas effects of local forest structure were large. Patch area and circularization generally increased abundances of interior species of birds and forest-floor plants and woodland species of butterflies. Nevertheless, only patch circularization increased abundances of 1 woodland species of butterfly and 2 and 6 interior species of birds and forest-floor plants, respectively. We did not find any significant interaction effects between patch area and shape. Our results suggest that although reserves generally should be large and circular, there is a trade-off between patch area and shape, which should be taken into consideration when managing reserves.

AB The majority of experimental studies of the effects of population bottlenecks on fitness are performed under laboratory conditions, which do not account for the environmental complexity that populations face in nature. In this study, we test inbreeding depression in multiple replicates of inbred when compared with non-inbred lines of Drosophila melanogaster under different temperature conditions. Egg-to-adult viability, developmental time and sex ratio of emerging adults are studied under low, intermediate and high temperatures under laboratory as well as semi-natural conditions. The results show inbreeding depression for egg-to-adult viability. The level of inbreeding depression is highly dependent on test temperature and is observed only at low and high temperatures. Inbreeding did not affect the developmental time or the sex ratio of emerging adults. However, temperature affected the sex ratio with more females relative to males emerging at low temperatures, suggesting that selection against males in pre-adult life stages is stronger at low temperatures. The coefficient of variation (CV) of egg-to-adult viability within and among lines is higher for inbred flies and generally increases at stressful temperatures. Our results contribute to knowledge on the environmental dependency of inbreeding under different environmental conditions and emphasize that climate change may impact negatively on fitness through synergistic interactions with the genotype.

AB An ability to predict the rate at which an organism spreads its range is of growing importance because the process of spread (during invasion by an exotic species) is almost identical to that occurring at the expanding range margins of a native species undergoing range shifts in response to climate change. Thus, the methods used for modelling range spread can also be employed to assess the distributional implications of climate change. Here we review the history of research on the spread of cane toads in Australia and use this case study to broadly examine the benefits and pitfalls of various modelling approaches. We show that the problems of estimating the current range, predicting the future range, and predicting the spread rate are interconnected and inform each other. Generally, we argue that correlative approaches to range-prediction are unsuitable when applied to invasive species and suggest that mechanistic methods are beginning to look promising (despite being more difficult to execute), although robust comparisons of correlative versus mechanistic predictions are lacking. Looking to the future, we argue that mechanistic models of range advance (drawing from both population ecology and environmental variation) are the approaches most likely to yield robust predictions. The complexity of these approaches coupled with the steady rise in computing power means that they have only recently become computationally tractable. Thus, we suggest that the field is only recently in a position to incorporate the complexity necessary to robustly model the rate at which species shift their range.

AB Time series of leafing phenology, air temperature and precipitation along with regional changes in carbon dioxide concentration, are analysed in addressing three questions: 'what magnitude of changes in flushing day are likely with climate change?', 'which taxa have a chilling requirement?' and 'is spring starting earlier?'. Phenological observations of leafing, starting in 1739, are used to calibrate a new model that describes the time of flushing. Statistical methods are used to provide full standard errors on the model coefficients. All 13 tree types studied are found to show an association between flushing date and air temperature. Nine out of the 13 tree types show non-linear temperature behaviour. Model output indicates that climate change has a particularly strong effect on flushing date in oceanic climates, such as that of Britain. The modelled responses can be used to estimate the impact that recent changes in temperature have had on the timing of the start of spring. We find that in any future climate-warming, flushing dates of tree types sensitive to 'chilling', for example beech and horse chestnut, are likely to move 30 days, or more, out of synchroneity with those sensitive only to springtime warmth. The new phenological model is also applied to fluctuations in the carbon dioxide mixing-ratio. Changes in the phase of the annual CO2 cycle are isolated and used as evidence for an earlier spring. We make use of a complex demodulation analysis of carbon dioxide, as monitored at 27 stations around the world, to reveal that the timing of the annual CO2 cycle has become steadily earlier in recent decades. Finally we show that the estimates of the effect of rising temperatures on the earliness of spring, made using our new phenological model, are in good agreement with global observations of changes in the timing of the annual carbon dioxide cycle if about 50% of the biomass of the world's terrestrial biosphere is fully temperature sensitive and about 50% sensitive to chilling (or to an equivalent inhibitory effect).

AB Mate choice is common in most animals, but the issue has largely been ignored in regard to pelagic copepods-the most abundant zooplankton group in the oceans. Contemporary demographic models of copepods assume that all encounters lead to successful copulation and viable egg production. We revisit the subject of copepod mating biology in the framework of sexual selection theory. We discuss, and point to, examples that suggest mate choice in both sexes. Sexual selection theory may add an important dimension for understanding copepod population dynamics and potentially lead to renewed interpretations of the diverse copepod behaviours and life histories. In addition, the range of mating strategies in copepods represents a rich, but unexplored, source of information for general behavioural ecologists.

AB Where habitat loss and fragmentation is severe, many native species are likely to have reduced levels of dispersal between remnant populations. For those species to avoid regional extinction in fragmented landscapes, they must undergo some kind of metapopulation dynamics so that local extinctions are countered by recolonisation. The importance of spatial dynamics for regional survival means that research into metapopulation dynamics is essential. In this review I explore the approaches taken to examine metapopulation dynamics, highlight the analytical methods used to get the most information out of field data, and discover some of the major research gaps. Statistical models, including Hanski's INCIDENCE FUNCTION model (IFM) are frequently applied to presence-absence data, an approach that is often strengthened using long-term data sets that document extinctions and colonisations. Recent developments are making the IFM more biologically realistic and expanding the range of situations for which the model is relevant. Although accurate predictions using the IFM seem unlikely, it may be useful for ranking management decisions. A key weakness of presence-absence modelling is that the mechanisms underlying spatial dynamics remain inferential, so combining modelling approaches with detailed demographic research is warranted. For species where very large data sets cannot be obtained to facilitate statistical modelling, a demographic approach alone or with stochastic modelling may be the only viable research angle to take. Dispersal is a central process in metapopulation dynamics. Research combining mark-recapture or telemetry methods with model-selection procedures demonstrate that dispersal is frequently oversimplified in conceptual and statistical metapopulation models. Dispersal models like the island model that underlies classic metapopulation theory do not approximate the behaviour of real species in fragmented landscapes. Nevertheless, it remains uncertain if additional biological realism will improve predictions of statistical metapopulation models. Genetic methods can give better estimates of dispersal than direct methods and take less effort, so they should be routinely explored alongside direct ecological methods. Recent development of metacommunity theory (communities connected by dispersal) emphasises a range of mechanisms that complement metapopulation theory. Taking both theories into account will enhance interpretation of field data. The extent of metapopulation dynamics in human modified landscapes remains uncertain, but we have a powerful array of field and analytical approaches for reducing this knowledge gap. The most informative way forward requires that many species are Studied in the same fragmented landscape by applying a selection of approaches that reveal complementary aspects of spatial dynamics.

   POPULATIONS; PHYLOGEOGRAPHY; BRANCHIOPODA; EUROPE; DIVERGENCE
AB Background: The Notostraca is a small but ancient crustacean order with a contrasting combination of a conservative morphology and a wide range of reproductive modes. The tadpole shrimp Triops cancriformis, includes bisexual - the putatively ancestral state -, androdioecious and hermaphrodite populations. As hermaphroditism and androdioecy confer a colonisation advantage, we expect the postglacial colonisation of northern Europe to have been effected by lineages with such reproductive modes. Therefore, N European populations should be composed of closely related lineages reflecting a recent range expansion. In contrast, glacial refugia in the south should contain bisexual populations with high haplotype diversity and more population structuring. To test these hypotheses, we analysed the geographic distribution of reproductive modes based on new and published sex ratio data. In addition, we investigated the European phylogeography of T. cancriformis by sequencing over a 1000 bp of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in individuals from a large sample of populations of the three recognised subspecies.
   Results: Bisexual populations were only found in the Iberian Peninsula, with the rest of European populations showing low male proportions or no males. Androdioecious populations were found in Central and Eastern Europe. Regarding mtDNA diversity, Spanish and Moroccan populations of T. c. mauritanicus were highly divergent, and showed strong population structure. In contrast, Triops c. cancriformis and T. c. simplex formed a single mtDNA lineage with low haplotype diversity. This diversity was structured into two phylogenetic clades (A, B), coexisting in E Germany. Basal haplotypes of both lineages were found in the Iberian Peninsula. Most of the populations in clade A and B are either hermaphroditic or androdioecious, with the only bisexual population in these clades found in the Iberian Peninsula. The genetic divergence between these two clades suggests a split in the Late Pleistocene and their geographic distribution reflects a complex evolutionary history of European Triops populations, with possibly two episodes of range expansions - one of them by clade A - involving androdioecious and hermaphroditic populations.
   Conclusion: As we predicted, N European populations of T. cancriformis are closely related, with few widely distributed haplotypes and indications of a recent range expansion involving hermaphroditic/androdioecious lineages. A possible second range expansion or long distance colonisation may have created the secondary contact zone between T. c. cancriformis/simplex clades A and B. The large haplotype diversity and strong genetic subdivision in the Iberian Peninsula, which is known to contain only bisexual populations, strongly suggest that this area was a Pleistocene refugium for T. cancriformis, although the occurrence of additional eastern refugia cannot be ruled out. Our data support the status of T. c. mauritanicus as a separate species and the colonisation of N Africa from the Iberian Peninsula. We suggest that hermaphroditism/androdioecy has evolved recently in T. cancriformis and has facilitated the postglacial colonisation of northern Europe.

AB Twenty-one coral- and coral rock-associated gobiid fish species were examined in the Gulf of Aqaba, northern Red Sea in autumn 2003 and spring 2004. They represent the seven genera Bryaninops, Eviota, Gobiodon, Paragobiodon, Pleurosicya, Priolepis and Trimma. All species showed clear spatial niche segregation. Branching corals of the genus Acropora were obligatorily inhabited by Gobiodon spp., while Paragobiodon echinocephalus was restricted to Stylophora pistillata. Three Bryaninops species showed species-specific associations with Acropora spp., Millepora dichotoma and Cirripathes sp. Most of the five Eviota species had weak associations with live corals but frequented coral rock. Among the genus Pleurosicya, two species were encountered. Pleurosicya micheli frequented massive scleractinian corals, while P. prognatha occupied various species of Acropora. Priolepis semidoliata was only occasionally observed on coral rock. Weak associations with scleractinian corals were documented in Trimma avidori and T. mendelssohni, both of which inhabit coral rock. Principal component and cluster analyses showed several morphological features to be important ecomorphological traits. Gobiid species inhabiting encrusting or massive corals have a more depressed body than species in branching corals. Eye size was well correlated with preferred water depth, especially in the coral-associated species. A typical gobiid feature - the pelvic disc - was found in very different character states, and corresponded to preferred microhabitats. A well-developed suctorial pelvic disc was typical for obligate coral-dwellers.

AB In the rivers of northern Italy, the presence of water is typically continuous all year long, although in the last five decades there has been a conspicuous increase in drought periods, mainly caused by human impacts and climate change. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of the length of the drought periods on macroinvertebrate assemblages. We collected invertebrates in four reaches of the Po river, characterised by different periods of absence of surface water. We found significant differences among the stations in invertebrate abundance and taxa richness, with a decrease in the more drought-affected stream reaches. Collector-gatherers significantly increased as the drought period lengthened, while the opposite occurred for scrapers and shredders. The areas with a discontinuous presence of water were mainly colonised by small, fast-growing, plurivoltine organisms. A main result of our study is that only a few taxa appear to be able to survive in reaches with intermittent flow, underlining the great ecological difference between perennial and naturally intermittent streams. Our results suggest that the recent increase of droughts will likely cause an impoverishment of benthic communities in prealpine rivers.

AB Invasions of exotic plant species in estuaries have occurred worldwide, and may profoundly affect native biodiversity and estuarine ecosystem functioning. To assess the effect of plant invasions on benthic meiofauna, we compared the nematode communities in marshes dominated, respectively, by invasive Spartina alterniflora and native Scirpus mariqueter and Phragmites australis at 3 local sites over 2 seasons in the Yangtze River estuary, PR China. S. alterniflora stands had generally lower nematode trophic diversity than the stands of the 2 native plants, suggesting that the exotic plant led to a simplified benthic food web. The relative abundance of bacterial-feeding nematodes tended to increase in S. alterniflora marshes compared to P. australis marshes. The increased bacterial-feeding nematodes in S. alterniflora stands are likely to reflect the altered decomposition processes, rates and pathways, which may, in turn, modify belowground nutrient cycling of the estuarine ecosystems. The dissimilarity in nematode community structure between S. alterniflora and S. mariqueter marshes was smaller than that between S. alterniflora and P. australis marshes, and the dissimilarity between Spartina-invaded and native marshes was even smaller than between the 2 native plant marshes. It is suggested that the detection of the ecological consequences of plant invasions depends on which native plant species is considered. Site effects were generally detected in the comparison of sediment properties and nematodes among 3 plant marshes. Sediment water content, electrical conductivity, bacterial biomass and litter biomass were identified as the most important factors in the shaping of the nematode communities.

AB Factors with variation at broad (e.g., climate) and fine scales (e.g., soil texture) that influence local processes at the plant scale (e.g., competition) have often been used to infer controls on spatial patterns and temporal trends in vegetation. However, these factors can be insufficient to explain spatial and temporal variation in grass cover for and and semiarid grasslands during an extreme drought that promotes woody plant encroachment. Transport of materials among patches may also be important to this variation. We used long-term cover data (19152001) combined with recently collected field data and spatial databases from a site in the northern Chihuahuan Desert to assess temporal trends in cover and the relative importance of factors at three scales (plant. patch, landscape unit) in explaining spatial variation in grass cover. We examined cover of five important grass species from two topographic positions before, during, and after the extreme drought of the 1950s. Our results show that dynamics before, during, and after the drought varied by species rather than by topographic position. Different factors were related to cover of each species in each time period. Factors at the landscape unit scale (rainfall, stocking rate) were related to grass cover in the pre- and post-drought periods whereas only the plant-scale factor of soil texture was significantly related to cover of two upland species during the drought. Patch-scale factors associated with the redistribution of water (microtopography) were important for different species in the pre- and post-drought period. Another patch-scale factor, distance from historic shrub populations, was important to the persistence of the dominant grass in uplands (Bouteloua eriopoda) through time. Our results suggest the importance of local processes during the drought, and transport processes before and after the drought with different relationships for different species. Disentangling the relative importance of factors at different spatial scales to spatial patterns and long-term trends in grass cover can provide new insights into the key processes driving these historic patterns, and can be used to improve forecasts of vegetation change in and and semiarid areas.

AB Two species of horned lizards are sympatric along the periphery of the Salton Trough. Phrynosoma mcallii, endemic to the trough, is of conservation concern because its limited habitat has been fragmented by human activities. A more common and widespread species, Phrynosoma platyrhinos, occurs around the periphery of the trough and much further to the North. The two species are syntopic at a few localities, where morphological intermediates have also been found. Here, we used nested clade phylogeographical analysis (NCPA) and analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA), to examine 781 bp of mitochondrial DNA (nad4 and two tRNAs) from 82 individuals of P. mcallii. We tested whether populations of this species were recently connected, or if they were historically isolated prior to human modification of the region. Our NCPA results indicated significant population structure associated with the Colorado River, suggesting limited gene flow and potential isolation across this barrier. Populations west of the Colorado River, currently isolated from one another by human development, show less genetic differentiation. We also collected homologous sequence data from 34 individuals of P. platyrhinos and seven specimens morphologically intermediate between P. mcallii and P. platyrhinos, as a preliminary investigation of hybridization between these two species. From phylogenetic results of these data, we identified a species (Phrynosoma goodei) previously recognized as a subspecies of P. platyrhinos. Six of the morphologically intermediate specimens shared mtDNA haplotypes with P. goodei, while one was nested among P. mcallii haplotypes.

AB We determined the complete nucleotide sequence of the mitochondrial (mt) genome of a Malagasy poison frog, Mantella madagaseariensis (family Mantellidae), and partial sequences of two Mantella (M. baroni and All. bernhardi) and two additional mantellid species (Boophis madagascariensis and Mantidactylus cf. ulcerosus). The M. madagascariensis genome was shown to be the largest (23 kbp) of all vertebrate mtDNAs investigated so far. Furthermore, the following unique features were revealed: (1) the positions of some genes and gene regions were rearranged compared to mitochondrial genomes typical for vertebrates and other anuran groups, (2) two distinct genes and a pseudogene corresponding to transfer RNA gene for methionine (IRNA-Met) were encoded, and (3) two control regions with very high sequence homology were present. These features were shared by the two other Mantella species but not the other mantellid species, indicating dynamic genome reorganization in a common ancestor linage before divergence of the Mantella genus. The reorganization pathway could be explained by a model of gene duplication and deletion. Duplication and deletion events also seem to have been responsible for concerted sequence evolution of the control regions in Mantella mt genomes. It is also suggested that the pseudo tRNA-Met gene sustained for a long time in Mantella mt genomes possibly functions as a punctuation marker for NADH dehydrogenase subunit (ND) 2 mRNA processing. Phylogenetic analyses employing a large sequence data set of mt genes supported the monophyly of Mantellidae and Rhacophoridae and other recent phylogenetic views for ranoid frogs. The resultant phylogenetic relationship also suggested parallel Occurrence of two tRNA-Met genes, duplicated control regions, and ND5 gene translocation in independent ranoid lineages.

AB Nitrogen (N) availability and light exposure were manipulated under field conditions to study responses to altered resource supply in the green algal lichen Platismatia glauca.
   The lichen was fertilized with different concentrations and frequencies of ammonium, nitrate or glutamine under different light regimes for 2-3 months. Responses were followed from the intact thallus to the cellular level.
   Despite significant differences in overall light exposure, light conditions were not significantly different among treatments when the lichens were wet and active. Ammonium was the preferred N source, followed by glutamine and then nitrate. Thallus N concentration as well as the chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentration increased 3-4-fold at the highest ammonium concentration, while the mycobiont ergosterol concentration remained unaltered. Growth was significantly enhanced by the enhanced N supply, with the increase in dry weight varying from 3 to 30%. Variation in Chl a concentration explained 31% of this variation, suggesting a causal link to the increased growth rate.
   Platismatia glauca responded to increased N availability by increasing its growth rate and carbon assimilation capacity through increased investments in the photobiont cells. This suggests a tight regulation of resource investments and metabolic pathways between the symbionts of this lichen.

AB Biological indicators are increasingly being used as integrative measures of ecosystem health in streams, particularly indicators using macroinvertebrate assemblage composition. Several indicators of this type have been advocated, including biotic indices based on taxa sensitivities, richness indices and ratios of observed to expected taxa from models predicting assemblage composition in streams with little human impact (O/E scores). The present study aimed to compare the sensitivity of indicators of each of these types ( all used for legislated objectives for stream protection in Victoria, Australia) to a gradient of urban disturbance in 16 streams in a small area in eastern Melbourne. The biotic index SIGNAL and number of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera or Trichoptera families were the most sensitive indicators, whereas total number of families and O/E scores from Australian river assessment system (AUSRIVAS) models were least sensitive. Differences in sensitivity were not the result of sampling or taxonomic inadequacies. AUSRIVAS and similar models might be improved by using only predictor variables that are not affected by human impacts and by sounder approaches to model selection. Insensitivities of indicators and misclassification of sites by the Victorian objectives show that assessment of indicators against disturbance gradients is critical for setting management objectives based on biological indicators.

AB Dryland rivers occur over much of Australia's inland and have some of the most variable patterns of flow in the world. Despite their dominance in terms of Australia's river types, dryland rivers have not been the focus of the recent increase in research on indicators of river health, mostly owing to their spatial remoteness and relatively low levels of water resource development and human disturbance. Most rivers in arid and semi-arid regions are ephemeral, and only carry significant flows during the wetter months or following infrequent but intense rainfall events. It is not known which, if any, of the existing approaches to river health assessment can be used to accurately assess the health of these large ephemeral rivers. This paper considers why the standard methods for interpreting the currently-used indicators for river health may need to be adapted for variable systems and suggests the use of trends that recogruse natural variation in indicator values for undertaking this.

AB Forage quality affects physiological condition, population dynamics, habitat use, and distribution of ungulates. We studied how rainfall, temperature, forage biomass, and forage growth are related to water content, crude protein (CP), and in vitro dry-matter digestibility (IVDMD) of some common forage species of desert mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus eremicus Mearns) in the Sonoran Desert, California. We established vegetation transects in desert washes to collect forage samples and to measure forage biomass, growth, rainfall, and temperature on a quarterly basis. Percent water and CP were positively associated with forage growth (P < 0.001) and with rainfall (P < 0.025). There were positive relationships between IVDMD and forage growth (P < 0.001), forage biomass (P < 0.001), and the combination of temperature and rainfall (P < 0.001). These findings suggest that the highest quality landscapes for deer are those with rapidly growing forage where forage water, CP, and IVDMD are greatest. With the quantified relationships between rainfall, temperature, and forage characteristics presented here, the nutritional constituents for deer forage can be predicted.

AB We present a study of the genetic diversity and structure of a tropical tree in an insular system. Santalum austrocaledonicum is endemic to the archipelago of New Caledonia and is exploited for oil extraction from heartwood. A total of 431 individuals over 17 populations were analysed for eight polymorphic microsatellite loci. The number of alleles per locus ranged from 3 to 33 and the observed heterozygosity per population ranged from 0.01 in Mare to 0.74 in Ile des Pins. The genetic diversity was lowest in the most recent islands, the Loyautes, and highest in the oldest island, Grande Terre, as well as the nearby small Ile des Pins. Significant departures from panmixia were observed for some loci-population combinations (per population F-IS = 0-0.03 on Grande-Terre and Ile des Pins, and 0-0.67 on Loyautes). A strong genetic differentiation among all islands was observed (F-ST = 0.22), and the amount of differentiation increased with geographic distance in Iles Loyaute and in Grande Terre. At both population and island levels, island age and isolation seem to be the main factors influencing the amount of genetic diversity. In particular, populations from recent islands had large average F-IS that could not be entirely explained by null alleles or a Wahlund effect. This result suggests that, at least in some populations, selfing occurred extensively. Conclusively, our results indicate a strong influence of insularity on the genetic diversity and structure of Santalum austrocaledonicum.

AB A gradient of microbial diversity in soil was established by inoculating pasteurized soil with microbial populations of different complexity, which were obtained by a combination of soil fumigation and filtering techniques. Four different soil diversity treatments were planted with six different grass species either in monoculture or in polyculture to test how changes of general microbial functions, such as catabolic diversity and nutrient recycling efficiency would affect the performance of the plant communities. Relatively harsh soil treatments were necessary to elicit visible effects on major soil processes such as decomposition and nitrogen cycling due to the high redundancy and resilience of soil microbial communities. The strongest effects of soil diversity manipulations on plant growth occurred in polycultures where interspecific competition between plants was high. In polycultures, soil diversity reduction led to a gradual, linear decline in biomass production of one subordinate grass species (Bromus hordeaceus), which was compensated by increased growth of two intermediate competitors (Aegilops geniculata, B. madritensis). This negative covariance in growth of competing grass species smoothed the effects of soil diversity manipulations at the plant community level. As a result, total shoot biomass production remained constant. Apparently the effects of soil diversity manipulations were buffered because functional redundancy at both, the microbial and the plant community level complemented each other. The results further suggests that small trade-offs in plant fitness due to general functional shifts at the microbial level can be significant for the outcome of competition in plant communities and thus diversity at much larger scales.

AB We investigated mechanisms enabling persistence of the introduced Asian kelp Undaria pinnatifida on the sea urchin (Heliocidaris erythrogramma) 'barrens' on the east coast of Tasmania. Development of dense stands of U. pinnatifida requires disturbance to reduce the cover of native algae. Observations of U. pinnatifida occurring abundantly on sea urchin barrens suggests that disturbance in the form of grazing by sea urchins prevents recovery of native canopy-forming species, allowing dense stands of U. pinnatifida to persist. We examined this hypothesis over a 30 mo period in a manipulative experiment in which the response of native algae and U. pinnatifida was examined in treatments comprising all possible combinations of +/- urchins, +/- U. pinnatifida and +/ enhanced native algal spore inoculum. The results demonstrated that the sea urchin H. erythrogramma can have a significant impact on U. pinnatifida abundance. The response was most dramatic in the 2001 sporophyte growth season, when sea urchins destructively grazed U. pinnatifida sporophytes in experimental plots on the urchin barren. In other years, when there was higher recruitment of U. pinnatifida sporophytes, urchins reduced sporophyte abundance but did not prevent development of a U. pinnatifida canopy. Removal of sea urchins resulted in a slow increase in cover of understorey red algae, but only limited recovery of native canopy-forming species. In treatments where both sea urchins and U. pinnatifida were removed, cover of canopy-forming species did not exceed 6% over the duration of the study. Thus, in the absence of sea urchin grazing, there was no evidence of inhibition of U. pinnatifida by native algae. While the intensity of sea urchin grazing may directly influence the extent of the U, pinnatifida canopy, recovery of native canopy-forming species was apparently influenced by a combination of factors including seaurchin grazing, depth and, most importantly, the degree of sediment accumulation on the rocky substratum. The manipulations showed that removal of the factor (i.e. sea urchin grazing) that ostensibly facilitated replacement of native canopy-forming algae by U. pinnatifida did not realise recovery of native canopy-forming species.

AB 1. Manipulative experiments are often used to identify causal linkages between biodiversity and productivity in terrestrial and aquatic habitats.
   2. Most studies have identified an effect of biodiversity, but their interpretation has stimulated considerable debate. The main difficulties lie in separating the effect of species richness from those due to changes in identity and relative density of species.
   3. Various experimental designs have been adopted to circumvent problems in the analysis of biodiversity. Here I show that these designs may not be able to maintain the probability of type I errors at the nominal level (alpha = 0.05) under a true null hypothesis of no effect of species richness, in the presence of effects of density and identity of species.
   4. Alternative designs have been proposed to discriminate unambiguously the effects of identity and density of species from those due to number of species. Simulations show that the proposed experiments may have increased capacity to control for type I errors when effects of density and identity of species are also present. These designs have enough flexibility to be useful in the experimental analysis of biodiversity in various assemblages and under a wide range of environmental conditions.

AB Reconstruction of ancestral DNA and amino acid sequences is an important means of inferring information about past evolutionary events. Such reconstructions suggest changes in molecular function and evolutionary processes over the course of evolution and are used to infer adaptation and convergence. Maximum likelihood (ML) is generally thought to provide relatively accurate reconstructed sequences compared to parsimony, but both methods lead to the inference of multiple directional changes in nucleotide frequencies in primate mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). To better understand this surprising result, as well as to better understand how parsimony and ML differ, we constructed a series of computationally simple "conditional pathway" methods that differed in the number of substitutions allowed per site along each branch, and we also evaluated the entire Bayesian posterior frequency distribution of reconstructed ancestral states. We analyzed primate mitochondrial cytochrome b (Cyt-b) and cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) genes and found that ML reconstructs ancestral frequencies that are often more different from tip sequences than are parsimony reconstructions. In contrast, frequency reconstructions based on the posterior ensemble more closely resemble extant nucleotide frequencies. Simulations indicate that these differences in ancestral sequence inference are probably due to deterministic bias caused by high uncertainty in the optimization-based ancestral reconstruction methods (parsimony, ML, Bayesian maximum a posteriori). In contrast, ancestral nucleotide frequencies based on an average of the Bayesian set of credible ancestral sequences are much less biased. The methods involving simpler conditional pathway calculations have slightly reduced likelihood values compared to full likelihood calculations, but they can provide fairly unbiased nucleotide reconstructions and may be useful in more complex phylogenetic analyses than considered here due to their speed and flexibility. To determine whether biased reconstructions using optimization methods might affect inferences of functional properties, ancestral primate mitochondrial tRNA sequences were inferred and helix-forming propensities for conserved pairs were evaluated in silico. For ambiguously reconstructed nucleotides at sites with high base composition variability, ancestral tRNA sequences from Bayesian analyses were more compatible with canonical base pairing than were those inferred by other methods. Thus, nucleotide bias in reconstructed sequences apparently can lead to serious bias and inaccuracies in functional predictions.

AB Palsa mires are mire complexes that occur in the Northern Hemisphere, representing one of the most marginal permafrost features at the outer limit of the permafrost zone. A climate-based spatial model is presented for the distribution of palsa mires in northern Europe. The model is based on an extensive spatial data of palsa mires and climatological variables from 1913 grid cells in an area of c. 240 000 km(2). Generalized linear modelling (GLM) with curvilinear and interaction terms is used to derive the palsa mire-climate relationships. The final model correctly classified 77(.)6 per cent of the palsa mire presence squares. The results indicate a positive association of the distribution of palsa mires with increasing frost number and continentality, whereas precipitation and temperature showed a negative correlation with the distribution of palsa mires. Additionally, interaction of thawing degree days and summer time precipitation showed a negative association. Climatologically, the optimum areas of palsa mires occur in areas of low precipitation (<450 mm) and a mean annual temperature between -3 degreesC and -5 degreesC. Potential reasons for the performance of the model and the sensitivity of palsa mires to climate change are discussed. The application of a GIS-based generalized linear modelling as used here provides a versatile method to study the distribution of different geomorphological phenomena across climatological gradients.

AB Bud mite, blister mite (Colomerus vitis Pagenstecher), and rust mite (Calepitrimerus vitis Nalepa) (Acari: Eriophyoidae) are recognized grapevine pests. Much of the biology and ecology of these pests is poorly understood. We used two types of molecular markers to gain further insight into the breeding biology and population structure of these mites, using individuals collected from sites around south-eastern Australia. Patterns of genetic variation observed using PCR-RFLP of ITS 1 (Internal Transcribed Spacer 1) confirmed the separate species status of the rust mite, and resolved the species status of bud and blister mites, revealing two closely related but distinct species. Microsatellite markers revealed extensive genetic differentiation between bud mite populations and blister mite populations even at micro-geographical levels, suggesting low movement in these species. The findings indicate that separate control strategies are needed against bud and blister mites, and that localized control strategies are likely to be effective given their limited dispersal.

AB The genus Apomastus Bond & Opell is a relatively small group of mygalomorph spiders with a limited geographic distribution. Restricted to the Los Angeles Basin, San Juan Mountains, and San Joaquin Hills, Apomastus occupies a fragile habitat rapidly succumbing to urban encroachment. Although originally described as monotypic, the genus was hypothesised to contain at least one additional species. However, females of the two reputed species are morphologically indistinguishable and the authors were unable confidently to assign specific status to populations for which they lacked male specimens. Using an approach that combines geographic, morphological and molecular data, all known populations are assigned to one of two hypothesised species. Mitochondrial DNA cytochrome c oxidase I sequences are used to infer population phylogeny, providing the evolutionary framework necessary to resolve population and species identity issues. Conflicts between the parsimony and Bayesian analyses raise questions about species delineation, species paraphyly, and the application of molecular taxonomy to these taxa. Issues relevant to the conservation of Apomastus species are discussed in light of the substantive intraspecific species divergence observed in the mtDNA data. The type species, Apomastus schlingeri Bond & Opell, is redescribed and a second species, Apomastus kristenae, sp. nov., is described.

AB Reef habitats of the tropical Atlantic are separated by river outflows and oceanic expanses that may preclude larval dispersal or other population connections in shorefishes. To examine the impact of these habitat discontinuities on the intraspecific phylogeography of reef-associated species we conducted range-wide surveys of two amphi-Atlantic reef fishes that have dispersive pelagic larval stages. Based on 593 bp of mtDNA cytochrome b from the rock hind Epinephelus adscensionis and 682 bp from the greater soapfish Rypticus saponaceous (n=109 and 86, respectively), we found evidence of relatively ancient separations as well as recent surmounting of biogeographic barriers by dispersal or colonization. Rock hind showed slight but significant population genetic differentiation across much of the tropical Atlantic Ocean (Phi(ST)=0.056), but deep divergence between the southeastern United States and seven other localities from the Bahamas to the south, central and east Atlantic (mean pairwise d=0.040, overall Phi(ST)=0.867). The geographic distribution of the two rock hind lineages is highly unusual in genetic studies of Caribbean Sea reef fishes, because those lineages are separated by less than 250 km of open water within a major biogeographic region. In contrast, highly significant population genetic structure was observed among greater soapfish from the SW Caribbean, Brazil, and mid-Atlantic ridge (Phi(ST)=0.372), with a deep evolutionary separation distinguishing putative R. saponaceous from West Africa (mean pairwise d=0.044, overall Phi(ST)=0.929). Both species show evidence for a potential connection between the Caribbean and Brazilian provinces. While widespread haplotype sharing in rock hind indicates that larvae of this species cross oceanic expanses of as much as 2000 km, such a situation is difficult to reconcile with the isolation of populations in Florida and the Bahamas separated by only 250 km. These findings indicate that populations of some species in disjunct biogeographic zones may be isolated for long periods, perhaps sufficient for allopatric speciation, but rare gene flow between zones may preclude such evolutionary divergence in other species.

AB We measured horizontal and vertical gradients of light (rPPFD) along four first-order branches of a Pinus densiflora Sieb. & Zucc. crown, and compared variations in specific leaf area (SLA), needle nitrogen concentration (N), chlorophyll concentration (Chl) and photosynthetic capacity (i.e., maximum rate of carboxylation (V, m)) along the two axes. The horizontal gradient of rPPFD along first-order branches was similar in magnitude to the vertical gradient of rPPFD from the upper to the lower crown. None of the measured parameters (i.e., SLA, N, Chl and V-cmax) were strictly proportional to rPPFD, although they were more or less correlated with light when data obtained for all of the crown were pooled (r(2) = 0.31-0.80). The slope of rPPFD against N on an area basis (N,,a) for a branch in the middle of the crown orientated northward was significantly greater than the slope for a similar branch orientated southward. Horizontal variations were unrelated to age effects because measurements were all on 1-year-old needles. We conclude that factors other than light (i.e., orientation) may influence N allocation within branches. There was considerably less variation in the relationship of V-cmax to N-area (r(2) = 0.58) than in the relationship of V-cmax to rPPFD (r(2) = 0.41). Fractional N distribution among components of the photosynthetic machinery was constant within the crown. Together with the relationships between rPPFD and N on a mass basis (r(2) = 0.80) and SLA and V-cmax (r(2) = 0.60), these findings suggest that most light acclimation in R densiflora occurs through changes in needle morphology (e.g., SLA) during development.

AB Population regulation requires between-generation temporal density dependence, which has proved difficult to document unequivocally in nature, especially in marine fishes. Field experiments and observations in the Bahamas demonstrated that such population regulation occurs in the coral-reef fish Gramma loreto. I performed manipulative field experiments that identified mortality as the primary source of demographic density dependence among local populations. The causative mechanism involved a response in the behavior of predators, which both aggregated and spent more time hunting where prey fish densities were high. Spatially density-dependent mortality (i.e., density dependence among populations) led to between-generation temporal density dependence (i.e., density dependence within populations over time) indicative of population regulation. Over three years-roughly two generations-local populations followed regular annual cycles of abundance that stemmed from seasonal patterns of recruitment. Despite considerable natural and experimentally induced variability in the recruitment of new individuals, adult density remained nearly constant. Because multispecies interactions such as predation can be necessary to regulate marine populations, effective management and conservation requires an ecosystem approach that preserves these interactions.

AB Most phylogeographic studies have used maximum likelihood or maximum parsimony to infer phylogeny and bootstrap analysis to evaluate support for trees. Recently, Bayesian methods using Marlov chain Monte Carlo to search tree space and simultaneously estimate tree support have become popular due to its fast search speed and ability to create a posterior distribution of parameters of interest. Here, I present a study that utilizes Bayesian methods to infer phylogenetic relationships of the cornsnake (Elaphe guttata) complex using cytochrome b sequences. Examination of the posterior probability distributions confirms the existence of three geographic lineages. Additionally, there is no support for the monophyly of the subspecies of E. guttata. Results suggest the three geographic lineages partially conform to the ranges of previously defined subspecies, although Shimodaira-Hasegawa tests suggest that subspecies-con strained trees produce significantly poorer likelihood estimates than the most likely trees reflecting the evolution of three geographic assemblages. Based on molecular support, these three geographic assemblages are recognized as species using evolutionary species criteria: E. guttata, Elaphe slowinskii, and Elaphe emoryi [phylogeographic, maximum likelihood, maximum parsimony, bootstrap, Bayesian, Markov chain Monte Carlo, cornsnake, Cytochrome b, geographic lineages, E. guttta, E. slowinskii, and E. emoryi].

AB We examined sequence variation in the control region of the mitochondrial genome from 778 seals sampled at 161 locations from northern Japan to southeastern Alaska to learn more about the evolutionary history and population structure of, and effects of recent declines on genetic diversity in, harbor seals (Phoca vitulina) in the northern Pacific Ocean. High haplotypic diversity (H = 0.975) and a poorly resolved mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) phylogeny suggest that harbor seals in the Pacific underwent a rapid expansion in population size in their recent evolutionary past, possibly after the retreat of Pleistocene ice sheets. Weak phylogeographic partitioning of lineages attests to a complex evolutionary and demographic history of contemporary Pacific populations. Extensive macrogeographic subdivision was evident among a subset of grouped localities that represent centers of abundance along the distributional continuum. Heterogeneity was influenced by population size and correlated with geographic distance, suggesting that dispersal occurs primarily among neighboring subpopulations. The 2 currently recognized subspecies of harbor seal in the Pacific, P. v. richardii of North America and P. v. stejnegeri of Asia, do not represent phylogenetically discrete mtDNA assemblages. The greatest differentiation detected was along the Commander-Aleutian Island chain, the region of the presumed subspecies boundary and a likely contact zone for expanding refugial populations of a number of marine mammal species after retreat of ice sheets. Differentiation between the Kodiak Archipelago and Prince William Sound, and between Bristol Bay and the Pribilof Islands, indicates that current management stocks are inappropriate and highlights the need for a detailed analysis of population and stock structure in Alaska. A decline in population size in Prince William Sound over the past few decades was accompanied by a discernible reduction in mtDNA diversity, manifested as a loss of rare haplotypes through random drift. A continued population decline will erode genetic diversity further, with potentially adverse effects on evolutionary potential and individual fitness.

AB Long-term exposure of plants to elevated CO2 often leads to downward photosynthetic acclimation. Nitrogen (N) deficiency could potentially exacerbate this response by reducing growth rate and the sink for photosynthates, but this has not always been observed. Experimentally, the interpretation of N effects on CO2 responses can be confounded by increasing severity of tissue N deficiency over time when N supply is not adjusted as demand increases. In this study, N supply ranged from sub- to supra-optimal (20-540 kgN ha(-l) equivalent), and relatively stable levels of tissue N concentration were obtained in all treatments by varying twice-weekly application rates in proportion to plant growth. The effects of N on photosynthesis and growth of beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) raised at ambient (35 Pa) and three elevated (70, 105, 140 Pa) CO2 partial pressures (pCO(2)) were evaluated. Averaging across N treatments, leaf total non-structural carbohydrates (TNC) were 2.5- to 3-fold higher and leaf N concentrations were 31-35% lower at elevated compared to ambient p CO2 . Light-saturated net CO2 assimilation rates measured at growth p CO2 (A(satg)) were significantly higher (26-40% depending on N supply) in plants grown at elevated compared to ambient pCO(2). When measured at a common p CO2 of 35 Pa, the A(sat) of plants grown at elevated CO2 was 15-29% less than that of plants grown at 35 Pa, indicative of downward photosynthetic acclimation. The magnitude of downward photosynthetic acclimation to elevated CO2 was greater in plants grown at high (180 and 540 kgN ha(-l) ) compared to low (20 and 60 kgN ha(-l)) N supply, and this was associated with a higher A(sat) at growth pCO(2), higher leaf area ratio (leaf area/total biomass), and higher TNC in leaves of high-N plants. Our results indicate that the effect of N on acclimation to CO2 will depend on the balance between supply and demand for N during the growing period, and the effect this has on biomass allocation and source-sink C balance at the whole-plant level.

AB The investigation of microsatellite markers has recently superseded that of isoenzymes for many population-biology applications. Microsatellites have the advantages of being dominant, neutral, highly polymorphic and easily scored by high-throughput methods. However, it is necessary to develop a new panel of markers for each group of organisms of interest. Previously, only about 5% of the markers that amplify Leishmania major microsatellite loci were also found to amplify L. donovani loci. A panel of 20 microsatellite markers that are polymorphic in L. donovani and L. infantum has now been developed, using a rapid-enrichment method that will be suitable for developing libraries of markers for other trypanosomatid species. This is the first panel of polymorphic microsatellite markers, to be isolated de novo from any species of Leishmania, that is large enough for population-biology applications.

AB Although neutral molecular markers have long been important tools for describing genetic variation in threatened fish species, many of the most critical questions in conservation relate more to quantitative genetic variation than to neutral markers. Quantitative genetic studies are typically expensive and time-consuming to conduct, especially in some of the long-lived vertebrates of conservation concern. The present review of recent literature in fish conservation genetics examines the traditional role of molecular studies in describing conservation units and providing indirect inference about local adaptation and adaptive potential. Of special interest are approaches that use a combination of molecular and quantitative genetic methods. Such studies are likely to provide important new insights into many conservation-related problems. The review also explores how increasing interest in non-neutral molecular markers is contributing to our understanding of the geographic scale and evolutionary importance of local adaptation in threatened populations. It is increasingly clear that advanced genetic technologies for the exploration of neutral and non-neutral molecular variation are leading to a fundamental shift in the way complex phenotypic traits are studied. This new synthesis of methods will have dramatic implications for fish conservation genetics and biology in general.

AB Variation in root respiration and total soil respiration measured in the field in an alder (Alnus glutinosa) forest is reported here, complementing previous studies of below-ground carbon relations.
   A novel technique, involving minimum disturbance to the roots, was used to measure tree fine-root respiration, while soil respiration was measured in an open system using infrared gas analysis. Calculations by process models of both rhizomicrobial, and bulk soil, respiration were compared with measurements of total soil respiration.
   The rhizomicrobial respiration rate was strongly temperature dependent, with the variation determined by fine root structural parameters. The data were used to calibrate a soil respiration model comprising mineralization and rhizomicrobial respiration submodels. The calculated annual rhizomicrobial respiration (1234 g m(-2)) matched the carbon balance of the alder trees calculated in earlier studies; however, the calculated total annual soil CO2 efflux (1754 g m(-2)) was very high compared with other European forest sites.
   The modelled total soil respiration fitted well to measured values; a changing groundwater table and modified carbon partitioning of the alder trees might account for deviations during early summer.

AB In the Amazon Basin, where deforestation rates are among the highest in the world, raising land productivity with perennial crop-based agroforestry systems may allow small farmers to meet economic demands with less forest clearing. Although tree-based agroecosystems may cycle nutrients more efficiently than other agricultural systems, difficulties maintaining phosphorus (P) availability to plants growing in tropical Ultisols and Oxisols may threaten the long-term sustainability of Amazonian agroforests. To determine how soil nutrient dynamics are altered when primary forest is converted to perennial crops, soils from eight 6-year-old peach palm (Bactris gusipaes Kunth)-cupuassu (Theobroma grandiflora) plantation agroforests were compared to those of adjacent native forests in Acre, Brazil. The response of fine roots to P microsite enrichment by agroforest and native forest plants on eight farms was measured using a root ingrowth bioassay to determine if a P-limitation already threatened agroforest sustainability. Localized root proliferation by individual agroforest species was also examined as a component of interspecific competition. The impact of agroforest adoption by small farmers on forest clearing was qualitatively examined through interviews and focus groups held with farmers participating in the field studies. Six years after establishment on sites initially occupied by native terra firme forest, exchangeable base cations, ECEC and pH were greater in agroforest soils than in those of adjacent forests. Extractable inorganic P was 30-50% lower in agroforest soil, suggesting that P uptake by the aggrading agroecosystem outpaced its restoration in the soil solution by other P pools. After 100 days, cupuassu root length and mass were greater in P-treated cores buried in agroforest alleys, but not in cores buried in rows. 'While a P deficiency in any of the agroforest components could not be inferred using the root ingrowth technique, the study of root proliferation demonstrated both the potential for interspecific competition among peach palm and other agroforest components. as well as opportunities for alleviating the impact of competition through management practices. Discussions with farmers revealed that this type of commercial plantation agroforest, unless managed to maintain productivity, may actually contribute to more forest clearing on small farms because of a lack of farmer confidence in the future of the system. Thus, despite more efficient nutrient cycling in tree-based agroecosystems, the decline in agroforest soil P following establishment must be addressed through management practices if plantation agroforests are to remain a sustainable land use in Amazonia.

AB A pot experiment was conducted with soil from a long-term (74-year) fertilization field experiment to compare the effects of organic and mineral fertilizers on mycorrhiza formation in clover, and mycorrhiza-mediated plant P uptake. Five treatments were selected from the field experiment representing different forms and levels of P. Mycorrhizal effects on plant growth and P uptake were estimated by comparing plants grown in untreated soil containing indigenous arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi, with plants grown in pasteurized soil. Short-term versus residual effects of fertilizer/manure were also measured by comparing treatments with or without fertilizers added at the start of the pot experiment. Mycorrhiza formation was greatest in soil that had received no P for 74 years, followed by soil having received 30 or 60 Mg ha(-1) farmyard manure (FYM), and soil having received 25 or 44 kg P ha(-1) in NPK fertilizers. Plant growth and P uptake were severely reduced in the absence of AM fungi for all mineral fertilizer treatments. In contrast, plants growing in soil that had received FYM grew equally well or better when non-mycorrhizal. Recent additions of NK fertilizer and FYM had no effect on mycorrhiza formation, while additions of NPK led to reduced colonization. It thus seems that moderate quantities of FYM have less adverse effects on AM than equivalent amounts of nutrients in NPK fertilizers, a phenomenon that is most likely due to a temporal difference in P availability and its gradual release that balance plant demand.

AB We investigated interspecific variation in leaf lifespan (persistence) and consequent differences in leaf biochemistry, anatomy, morphology, patterns of whole-tree carbon allocation and stand productivity. We tested the hypothesis that a species with short-lived foliage, Pinus radiata D. Don (mean leaf lifespan 2.5 years), grows faster than P. pinaster Ait., a species with more persistent foliage (leaf lifespan 5.6 years), and that the faster growth rate of P. radiata is associated with a greater allocation of nitrogen and carbon to photosynthetic tissues across a range of scales. In fully sunlit foliage, the proportion of leaf N in the major photosynthetic enzyme Rubisco (ribulose-1, 5-bisphosphate carboxylase) was greater in P. radiata than in P. pinaster, and, in mid-canopy foliage, the proportion of leaf N in thylakoid proteins was greater in P. radiata. A lesser proportion of needle cross-sectional area was occupied by structural tissue in P. radiata compared to P. pinaster. Foliage mass in stands of P. radiata was 9.7 t ha(-1) compared with 18.2 t ha(-1) in P. pinaster while leaf area index of both species was similar at 4.6 m(2) m(-2), owing to the compensating effect of differences in specific leaf area. Hence trade-offs between persistence and productivity were apparent as interspecific differences in patterns of whole-tree carbon allocation, needle morphology, anatomy and biochemistry. However, these interspecific differences did not translate into differences at the stand scale since rates of biomass accumulation were similar in both species (P. radiata 6.9+/-0.9 kg year(-1) tree(-1); P. pinaster 7.4+/-0.9 kg year(-1) tree(-1)). The similarities in performance at larger scales suggest that leaf area index (and radiation interception) determines growth and productivity.

AB To study the evolution of mtDNA and the intergeneric relationships of New World Jays (Aves: Corvidae), we sequenced the entire mitochondrial DNA control region (CR) from 21 species representing all genera of New World jays, an Old World jay, crows, and a magpie. Using maximum likelihood methods, we found that both the transition/transversion ratio (kappa) and among site rate variation (alpha) were higher in flanking domains I and II than in the conserved central domain and that the frequency of indels was highest in domain II. Estimates of kappa and alpha were much more influenced by the density of taxon sampling than by alternative optimal tree topologies. We implemented a successive approximation method incorporating these parameters into phylogenetic analysis. In addition we compared our study in detail to a previous study using cytochrome b and morphology to examine the effect of taxon sampling, evolutionary rates of genes, and combined data on tree resolution. We found that the particular weighting scheme used had no effect on tree topology and little effect on tree robustness. Taxon sampling had a significant effect on tree robustness but little effect on the topology of the best tree. The CR data set differed nonsignificantly from the tree derived from the cytochrome b/morphological data set primarily in the placement of the genus Gymnorhinus, which is near the base of the CR tree. However, contrary to conventional taxonomy, the CR data set suggested that blue and black jays (Cyanocorax sensu lato) might be paraphyletic and that the brown jay Psilorhinus (=Cyanocorax) morio is the sister group to magpie jays (Calocitta), a phylogenetic hypothesis that is likely as parsimonious with regard to nonmolecular characters as monophyly of Cyanocorax. The CR tree also suggests that the common ancestor of NWJs was likely a cooperative breeder. Consistent with recent systematic theory, our data suggest that DNA sequences with high substitution rates such as the CR may nonetheless be useful in reconstructing relatively deep phylogenetic nodes in avian groups.

AB Lotus japonicus has been proposed as a model plant for the molecular genetic study of plant-microbe interaction including Mesorhizobium loti and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi. Non-mycorrhizal mutants of Lotus japonicus were screened from a collection of 12 mutants showing non-nodulating (Nod(-)), ineffectively nodulating (Fix(-)) and hypernodulating (Nod(++)) phenotypes with monogenic recessive inheritance induced by EMS (ethylmethane sulfonate) mutagenesis, Three mycorrhizal mutant lines showing highly reduced arbuscular mycorrhizal colonization were obtained. All of them were derived from Nod- phenotypes. In Ljsym72, the root colonization by Glomus sp. R-10 is characterized by poor development of the external mycelium, formation of extremely branched appressoria, and the blocking of hyphal penetration at the root epidermis. Neither arbuscules nor vesicles were formed in Ljsym72 roots. Fungal recognition on the Foot surface was strongly affected by the mutation in the LjSym72 gene. Unique characteristics in mutant lines Ljsym71-1 and Ljsym71-2 were the overproduction of deformed appressoria and arrested hyphal penetration of the exodermis, Small amounts of internal colonization including degenerated arbuscule formation occurred infrequently in these types of mutants. Not only fungal development on the root surface but also that in the root exodermis and cortex was affected by the mutation in LjSym71 gene. These mutants represent a key advance in molecular research on the AM symbiosis.

AB Fluorescence images of leaves of sugar beet plants (Beta vulgaris L. cv. Patricia) grown on an experimental field with different fertilisation doses of nitrogen [0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 g(N) m(-2)] were taken, applying a new multicolour flash-lamp fluorescence imaging system (FL-FIS). Fluorescence was excited by the UV-range (280-400 nm, lambda (max) = 340 nm) of a pulsed Xenon lamp. The images were acquired successively in the four fluorescence bands of leaves near 440, 520, 690, and 740 nm (F-440, F-520, F-690, F-740) by means of a CCD-camera. Parallel measurements were performed to characterise the physiological state of the leaves (nitrogen content, invert-sugars, chlorophylls and carotenoids as well as chlorophyll fluorescence induction kinetics and beet yield). The fluorescence images indicated a differential local patchiness across the leaf blade for the four fluorescence bands. The blue (F-440) and green fluorescences (F-520) were high in the leaf veins, whereas the red (F-690) and far-red (F-740) chlorophyll (Chl) fluorescences were more pronounced in the intercostal leaf areas. Sugar beet plants with high N supply could be distinguished from beet plants with low N supply by lower values of F-440/F-690 and F-440/F-740. Both the blue-green fluorescence and the Chi fluorescence rose at a higher N application. This increase was more pronounced for the Chi fluorescence than for the blue-green one. The results demonstrate that fluorescence ratio imaging of leaves can be applied for a non-destructive monitoring of differences in nitrogen supply. The FL-FIS is a valuable diagnostic tool for screening site-specific differences in N-availability which is required for precision farming.

AB The relationships among 207 squirrels from 12 locations in the UK and three in mainland Europe were examined using mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region sequence. Twenty-six haplotypes were detected, many of which were population specific. Eighty per cent of the populations analysed contained two or more haplotypes. Hierarchical analysis of molecular variance showed the majority of genetic variation to be partitioned among populations. Genetic diversity varied considerably within the UK, and conformed to no obvious geographical trend. The populations in Argyll and Spadeadam Forest showed the highest levels of variation in the UK. However, the greatest genetic diversity was seen in Bavaria, southern Germany where six unique alleles were detected in a sample of 10 individuals. Phylogenetic analysis revealed no evolutionary divergence between UK and mainland European haplotypes. We conclude that, within the UK,the genetic patterns observed are most likely to be explained by the effects of genetic drift which has occurred since the isolation of populations during the past few hundred years, hence we cannot detect any underlying phylogeographic pattern. Therefore, the use of larger, geographically distinct populations within the UK for augmentation of small isolated populations is unlikely to pose problems of genetic incompatibility. Further, the role that demographic factors may have in complicating the application of current genetically based management unit criteria is likely to need further attention.

ID RIBOSOMAL DNA; EVOLUTION; MAMMALS; REGION
AB Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region sequences were analysed to determine the geographical genetic structure of Hippotragus niger (sable antelope) and H. equinus (roan antelope). Analyses by AMOVA, minimum evolution networks, parsimony, neighbour joining and maximum likelihood show that the roan antelope populations are geographically partitioned and that their phylogeography corresponds well with subspecific boundaries. In sharp contrast, however, our sequence data group all the sable antelope into two well-delineated maternal clades. One comprising specimens from the strictly east African H.n. roosevelti, and a second geographically diverse group which includes H.n. niger (South Africa, Zimbabwe), H.n. variani (Angola), and H.n. kirkii (Zambia, Malawi). The differences in the genetic population structure suggest that distinct extrinsic and intrinsic factors have shaped the phylogeography of these two closely related antelope species. In the absence of obvious extrinsic barriers to gene flow, we suggest that behavioural differences may be responsible, at least in part, for the contrasting spatial patterns detected among geographical localities. Although our data reflect only the maternal phylogeny of these important game species, they nonetheless suggest that different management strategies should be applied. We recommend that roan antelope be translocated only within the currently defined subspecies boundaries, while in the case of sable antelope, conservation measures should focus on preserving the genetic integrity of the east African and southern African sable populations. Implicit in this is that translocations of animals between populations comprising these two distinct maternal genetic clades should be actively discouraged.

AB Variation in metabolism affects energy budgets of individuals and may serve as a mechanism that influences variation at whole organism or population levels. For example, sex differences in metabolic expenditure may contribute to bioenergetic sources of sexual size dimorphism. We measured oxygen consumption rates of 48 western diamondback rattlesnakes (Crotalus atrox) from a sexually dimorphic population and tested the effects of body mass, body temperature and time of day, in three groups of snakes: males, non-reproductive females, and vitellogenic females. Metabolic rates of male and non-reproductive female C. atrox were similar to rates reported for other rattlesnakes (mass exponents ranging from 0.645-0.670), Oxygen consumption was affected by body mass, body temperature and time of day, and was approximately 1.4 times greater in vitellogenic females than in non-reproductive females. No differences were found between males and non-reproductive females. Accordingly, differences in metabolic rate apparently do not contribute directly to sexual dimorphism in this population. Nevertheless, estimates of size-dependent maintenance expenditure lead us to hypothesize that adult female body size may represent a compromise between selection for increased litter size (accomplished by increasing body size), and selection for increased reproductive frequency (accomplished by decreasing body size, and, therefore inactive maintenance expenditure); this is a mechanistic scenario suggested previously for some endotherms.

AB The aim of this work was to establish a vegetative cover with an introduced grass on an infertile substrate which contains little mycorrhizal inoculum. A field experiment was carried out in La Gran Sabana, Venezuela, in an area that was disturbed in 1991 and in which no spontaneous recolonization by plant species occurred. Five treatments were set up in which an introduced grass. Brachiaria decumbens, was sown. The treatments were: non-inoculated control (NI); inoculated with a concentrated mix of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) (385 spores g(-1) inoculum) at 1750 kg ha(-1) (I); fertilized with triple superphosphate, 100 kg ha(-1) (P); inoculated with AMF and simultaneously fertilized with triple superphosphate (I+P); another control treatment, to which previously sterilized AMF inoculum was added (S). In all cases B. decumbens was seeded at 30 kg ha(-1). A soil microorganism inoculum free of mycorrhizae was added to all the treatments. Five months after sowing the grass, above and below ground biomass, % arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) colonization, root length and nutrient uptake were measured. The results showed an increase in plant cover, biomass and uptake of nutrients in the I+P treatment in comparison with all the other treatments. The rehabilitation of degraded lands in La Gran Sabana does not seem possible solely with the application of chemical fertilizers. It was evident that mycorrhizae are required to achieve rehabilitation, given that the I+P treatment led to significantly better results than those achieved with treatment P. The importance of mycorrhizae in the restoration of these lands is supported by the finding that, of the native plants which re-established in the different treatments, 81% were mycorrhizal.

AB Measurements of the profiles of leaf area and leaf nitrogen were made on five occasions from mid-flowering to maturity (53, 61, 70, 78 and 83 days after emergence, DAE) in sunflower crops grown at contrasting density (2.4 and 4.8 plants m(-2)) and nitrogen supply (0 and 5 g N m(-2) at emergence) in the summer in Buenos Aires, Argentina. As the crops matured, nitrogen was withdrawn unequally from all leaf positions and leaves senesced from the bases of the canopies. A model was used to estimate the daytime net photosynthesis (P-c) of canopies of defined leaf area and nitrogen content under the observed conditions of temperature and irradiance. Comparisons were made between the observed profiles of leaf nitrogen and those that would maximise P-c (the optimal profiles). The observed nitrogen profiles were sub-optimal at mid-flowering, except in the low-density, low-nitrogen treatment. The differences were most marked in the high-nitrogen treatments which held 'excessive' nitrogen in their lower canopies. As the canopies matured and nitrogen was mobilised to the grain, leaf area index and total nitrogen content decreased and optimal profiles changed shape from exponential to linear. During this period observed profiles became more optimal. There was, however, little difference in P-c between observed and optimal profiles. The maximum difference was 3.2% observed in the low-density, high-nitrogen treatment at DAE 53. The comparison of actual and optimal profiles as leaf nitrogen content (mg N) in addition to the more commonly used specific leaf nitrogen (SLN, g N m(-2) leaf) explains this result because relatively large changes in SLN in the small leaves at the top of canopies have little effect on P-c. The study shows that leaf nitrogen content is an appropriate basis for comparison of canopy nitrogen profiles in sunflower.

AB We compared photosynthetic rates and indices of nutrient-use efficiency for evergreen and deciduous shrubs growing in the Okefenokee swamp. Despite statistically significant differences between evergreen and deciduous species, photosynthetic variables and leaf-level nutrient-use efficiencies did not sort cleanly into two groups representing differences in leaf longevity-instead, traits varied continuously with specific leaf mass (SLM). Lyonia lucida, an evergreen (SLM: 161.1 g/m(2)), and Itea virginica, a deciduous shrub (SLM: 75.1 g/m(2)), represent the extremes of the gradient. Net photosynthesis on a leaf area basis (A(area)2) was higher for evergreen than deciduous shrubs but was lower for evergreens when calculated on a leaf mass basis (A(mass)). There was, however, considerable overlap among species with different leaf longevities. Discriminant analysis indicated that SLM was the most important variable differentiating species. Thus, SLM rather than leaf longevity pet se is a better predictor of leaf function. Instantaneous photosynthetic nitrogen-use efficiency (PNUE) or phosphorus-use efficiency (PPUE) did not predict whole plant nutrient-use efficiency, measured as percent nutrient retranslocation from leaves prior to abscission. Evergreen species had significantly higher P and N retranslocation efficiency than deciduous species, yet slightly lower PNUE and PPUE. The evergreen Cyrilla racemiflora retranslocated >90% of leaf P. High retranslocation efficiency for P indicates that this resource may be an important limiting nutrient in this swamp, and high retranslocation efficiency and a longer growing season may explain the higher productivity of evergreen than deciduous shrubs in the nutrient-limited swamp habitat. Midday stomatal closure for L. lucida (evergreen) and I. virginica (deciduous) corresponded with decreasing xylem pressure potential in conjunction with high evaporative demand. The development of large differences between root, stem, and leaf water potential indicates that high resistance to water flux may limit leaf conductance. Phosphorus limitations increase hydraulic resistance in some herbaceous plants and may contribute to water stress in the swamp habitat. Thus, in addition to the direct effects of nutrient limitations, reduced water uptake and transport may be an important stress for swamp shrubs.

AB In the northern Guinea Savanna of Ghana (1984-1987) a field experiment was conducted to study the reasons for beneficial effects of rotating maize (Zea mays) and cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) on yield and N and P use of maize. The treatments included two cropping systems, maize monocropping and maize/cowpea rotation, two levels of nitrogen (0 and 80kg N ha(-1) as urea) and two levels of phosphorus application (0 and 60 kg ha(-1) P as Volta phosphate rock). Yields and nutrient accumulation of maize were larger in rotation than in monocropping, independent of the N and P level. Fertilizer application (N and P) increased yields of maize in both cropping systems to the same extent. Nitrate contents of the soil after cowpea and after maize monoculture were comparable at the beginning of the cropping period. Also, potential nitrogen mineralization was only- slightly larger after cowpea in the unfertilized plots. However, soil nitrate of fertilized plots was similar or even higher under monocropping than under crop rotation, especially in deeper soil layers and at the end of the cropping period. This indicates that in addition to the availability of mineral N, its use by the plants was limiting for the productivity of maize. Root length densities of maize were significant lower in monocropped maize than in maize grown in rotation. Soil physical parameters (infiltration, bulk density, aggregate stability and water capacity) showed a significant deterioration compared to a bush fallow plot, but differed only slightly between the cropping systems. Also in a pot experiment maize growth was much better in the soil from the crop rotation than from the monocropping plots, provided P was eliminated as the main growth-limiting factor. Since this effect persisted in spite of N application and optimization of soil physical properties by mixing the soil with polystyrol it is concluded that the results indicate that yield decline in maize monocropping might be due to allelopathic effects.

TI Shallow marine bioerosion: preliminary results of an experimental study
SO BULLETIN OF THE GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF DENMARK
LA English
DT Article
AB In order to investigate long-term bioerosional effects on carbonate rock surfaces in shallow marine settings, test blocks were placed off a rocky shore on Rhodes, Greece at -3m to -17m. Retrieval of blocks each year allowed the progress of bioerosion to be monitored. Rapid colonization by endolithic algae was followed by recruitment of browsing chitons and echinoids. The first boring sponges arrived in year I but were barely visible until year 2. After six years, stable blocks were deeply bioeroded. The history of community development varies considerably from block to block, largely depending on degree of disturbance. Physical disturbance consists of block tumbling as a function of water turbulance levels and the block's weight and shape; biological disturbance comprises the activity of rasping herbivores. The surfaces reveal a mosaic of successional stages in community development. Equilibrium has not yet been established on stable blocks; unstable blocks remain at a pioneer phase of community succession. The slow progress implies that, in the fossil record, well bioeroded substrates such as skeletons and hard-grounds represent several years rather than months of depositional hiatus.

AB Tropical forests disappear rapidly because of deforestation, yet they have the potential to regrow naturally on abandoned lands. We analyze how 12 forest attributes recover during secondary succession and how their recovery is interrelated using 77 sites across the tropics. Tropical forests are highly resilient to low-intensity land use; after 20 years, forest attributes attain 78% (33 to 100%) of their old-growth values. Recovery to 90% of old-growth values is fastest for soil (<1 decade) and plant functioning (<2.5 decades), intermediate for structure and species diversity (2.5 to 6 decades), and slowest for biomass and species composition (>12 decades). Network analysis shows three independent clusters of attribute recovery, related to structure, species diversity, and species composition. Secondary forests should be embraced as a low-cost, natural solution for ecosystem restoration, climate change mitigation, and biodiversity conservation.

TI CAFE 5 models variation in evolutionary rates among gene families
SO BIOINFORMATICS
LA English
DT Article
AB Motivation: Genome sequencing projects have revealed frequent gains and losses of genes between species. Previous versions of our software, Computational Analysis of gene Family Evolution (CAFE), have allowed researchers to estimate parameters of gene gain and loss across a phylogenetic tree. However, the underlying model assumed that all gene families had the same rate of evolution, despite evidence suggesting a large amount of variation in rates among families.
   Results: Here, we present CAFE 5, a completely re-written software package with numerous performance and userinterface enhancements over previous versions. These include improved support for multithreading, the explicit modeling of rate variation among families using gamma-distributed rate categories, and command-line arguments that preclude the use of accessory scripts.

AB The future of humanity depends increasingly on the performance of cities. Big data provide new and powerful ways of studying and improving coupled urban environmental, social, and economic systems to achieve urban sustainability. However, the term big data has been defined variably, and its urban applications have so far been sporadic in terms of research topic and location. A comprehensive review of big data-based urban environment, society, and sustainability (UESS) research is much needed. The aim of this study was to summarize the big data-based UESS research using a systematic review approach in combination with bibliometric and thematic analyses. The results showed that the numbers of publications and citations of related articles have been increasing exponentially in recent years. The most frequently used big data in UESS research are human behavior data, and the major analytical methods are of five types: classification, clustering, regression, association rules, and social network analysis. The major research topics of big data-based UESS research include urban mobility, urban land use and planning, environmental sustainability, public health and safety, social equity, tourism, resources and energy utilization, real estate, and retail, accommodation and catering. Big data benefit UESS research by proving a people-oriented perspective, timely and real-time information, and fine-resolution spatial dynamics. In addition, several obstacles were identified to applying big data in UESS research, which are related to data quality and acquisition, data storage and management, data security and privacy, data cleaning and preprocessing, and data analysis and information mining. To move forward, future research should integrate multiple big data sources, develop and utilize new methods such as deep learning and cloud computing, and expand the application fields to focus on the interactions between human activities and urban environments. This review can contribute to understanding the current situation of big data-based UESS research, and provide a reference for studies of this topic in the future. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Land-use and land-cover changes associated with urbanization have significantly influenced biodiversity and ecosystem functions, as well as the supply and demand of ecosystem services (ESs). Assessing ESs and exploring their drivers are critical for regional land-use planning and ecological sustainability. In this study, the supply-demand matrix approach was used to quantify ES supply, demand, and their gap at multiple scales across the conterminous United States from 1940 to 2011. A new integrated measurement framework was proposed to offset ES deficits by identifying an optimal land-use conversion strategy. We focused on exploring the scale and spatial effects of the impacts of various drivers on ESs using ordination and regression analysis. The results showed that the expansion of developed land led to decreased ES supply and increased ES demand during the past seven decades, generating growing ES deficits at different scales, especially in highly urbanized metropolitan areas. To alleviate or offset ES deficits, promoting the intensive utilization of developed land and converting cropland, pasture, and barren land into forests would be the optimal land use strategies. Moreover, the drivers of ESs exhibited not only scale dependence but also spatial heterogeneity. The smaller the scale, the more diverse the drivers. The natural and socioeconomic drivers explained less variation at the metropolitan scale than at the state scale. Economic factors were key drivers for ESs at the state scale, while social factors were key drivers at the metropolitan scale. The regression coefficients for the drivers of ESs in the geographically weighted regression (GWR) model showed remarkable spatial heterogeneity. The GWR coefficients might have important implications for decision making in ES management. Localized and efficient land-use strategies and management policies are needed to reduce the ecological footprints of urban areas and thus achieve regional sustainability. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB Inferring past population dynamics over time from heterochronous molecular sequence data is often achieved using the Bayesian Skygrid model, a nonparametric coalescent model that estimates the effective population size over time. Available in BEAST, a cross-platform program for Bayesian analysis of molecular sequences using Markov chain Monte Carlo, this coalescent model is often estimated in conjunction with a molecular clock model to produce time-stamped phylogenetic trees. We here provide a practical guide to using BEAST and its accompanying applications for the purpose of drawing inference under these models. We focus on best practices, potential pitfalls, and recommendations that can be generalized to other software packages for Bayesian inference. This protocol shows how to use TempEst, BEAUti, and BEAST 1.10 (http://beast.community/; last accessed July 29, 2019), LogCombiner as well as Tracer in a complete workflow.

AB Aim Species distribution models are used across evolution, ecology, conservation and epidemiology to make critical decisions and study biological phenomena, often in cases where experimental approaches are intractable. Choices regarding optimal models, methods and data are typically made based on discrimination accuracy: a model's ability to predict subsets of species occurrence data that were withheld during model construction. However, empirical applications of these models often involve making biological inferences based on continuous estimates of relative habitat suitability as a function of environmental predictor variables. We term the reliability of these biological inferences 'functional accuracy.' We explore the link between discrimination accuracy and functional accuracy. Methods Using a simulation approach we investigate whether models that make good predictions of species distributions correctly infer the underlying relationship between environmental predictors and the suitability of habitat. Results We demonstrate that discrimination accuracy is only informative when models are simple and similar in structure to the true niche, or when data partitioning is geographically structured. However, the utility of discrimination accuracy for selecting models with high functional accuracy was low in all cases. Main conclusions These results suggest that many empirical studies and decisions are based on criteria that are unrelated to models' usefulness for their intended purpose. We argue that empirical modelling studies need to place significantly more emphasis on biological insight into the plausibility of models, and that the current approach of maximizing discrimination accuracy at the expense of other considerations is detrimental to both the empirical and methodological literature in this active field. Finally, we argue that future development of the field must include an increased emphasis on simulation; methodological studies based on ability to predict withheld occurrence data may be largely uninformative about best practices for applications where interpretation of models relies on estimating ecological processes, and will unduly penalize more biologically informative modelling approaches.

AB Landscape scientists have increasingly studied sustainability during the past three decades, with a plurality of perspectives and methods. However, a comprehensive review of the relevant literature is still lacking. Two concepts capture the core of these studies: sustainable landscapes (SL) and landscape sustainability (LS). Here we present a bibliometric analysis of 333 English papers published in SCI journals (i.e., indexed by Web of Science) during 1990-2017, whose titles, abstracts or keywords contain SL, LS, or both. Using multiple methods, including change-point detection, text and topic mining, and citation analysis, we found: (1) Sustainability studies of landscapes have entered a rapid growth phase since 2004-2006, as determined statistically by the annual publications and citations; (2) There have been many more studies focusing on the ecological and practical dimensions than sociocultural and theoretical dimensions; and (3) Influenced by advances in sustainability research in a broader science context, studies of SL and LS have become increasingly holistic, transdisciplinary, and normative. Our findings suggest that, to further advance landscape sustainability science, scholars need to be more explicit about the underlying sustainability perspective and associated scales of key terms (e.g., SL, LS, and ecosystem services) in specific studies, and need to put more emphasis on place-based case studies of various landscape unsustainability syndromes by integrating the sustainability science-based social-ecological systems and transdisciplinary perspectives.

AB The diversity of life in the sea is critical to the health of ocean ecosystems that support living resources and therefore essential to the economic, nutritional, recreational, and health needs of billions of people. Yet there is evidence that the biodiversity of many marine habitats is being altered in response to a changing climate and human activity. Understanding this change, and forecasting where changes are likely to occur, requires monitoring of organism diversity, distribution, abundance, and health. It requires a minimum of measurements including productivity and ecosystem function, species composition, allelic diversity, and genetic expression. These observations need to be complemented with metrics of environmental change and socio-economic drivers. However, existing global ocean observing infrastructure and programs often do not explicitly consider observations of marine biodiversity and associated processes. Much effort has focused on physical, chemical and some biogeochemical measurements. Broad partnerships, shared approaches, and best practices are now being organized to implement an integrated observing system that serves information to resource managers and decision-makers, scientists and educators, from local to global scales. This integrated observing system of ocean life is now possible due to recent developments among satellite, airborne, and in situ sensors in conjunction with increases in information system capability and capacity, along with an improved understanding of marine processes represented in new physical, biogeochemical, and biological models.

AB Soil organic matter (SOM) turnover increasingly is conceptualized as a tension between accessibility to microorganisms and protection from decomposition via physical and chemical association with minerals in emerging soil biogeochemical theory. Yet, these components are missing from the original mathematical models of belowground carbon dynamics and remain underrepresented in more recent compartmental models that separate SOM into discrete pools with differing turnover times. Thus, a gap currently exists between the emergent understanding of SOM dynamics and our ability to improve terrestrial biogeochemical projections that rely on the existing models. In this opinion paper, we portray the SOM paradigm as a triangle composed of three nodes: conceptual theory, analytical measurement, and numerical models. In successful approaches, we contend that the nodes are connected-models capture the essential features of dominant theories while measurement tools generate data adequate to parameterize and evaluate the models-and balanced-models can inspire new theories via emergent behaviors, pushing empiricists to devise new measurements. Many exciting advances recently pushed the boundaries on one or more nodes. However, newly integrated triangles have yet to coalesce. We conclude that our ability to incorporate mechanisms of microbial decomposition and physicochemical protection into predictions of SOM change is limited by current disconnections and imbalances among theory, measurement, and modeling. Opportunities to reintegrate the three components of the SOM paradigm exist by carefully considering their linkages and feedbacks at specific scales of observation.

AB 1. Few facets of biology vary more than functional traits and life-history traits. To explore this vast variation, functional ecologists and population ecologists have developed independent approaches that identify the mechanisms behind and consequences of trait variation.
   2. Collaborative research between researchers using trait-based and demographic approaches remains scarce. We argue that this is a missed opportunity, as the strengths of both approaches could help boost the research agendas of functional ecology and population ecology.
   3. This special feature, which spans three journals of the British Ecological Society due to its interdisciplinary nature, showcases state-of-the-art research applying trait-based and demographic approaches to examine relationships between organismal function, life history strategies and population performance across multiple kingdoms. Examples include the exploration of how functional trait x environment interactions affect vital rates and thus explain population trends and species occurrence; the coordination of seed traits and dispersal ability with the pace of life in plants; the incorporation of functional traits in dynamic energy budget models; or the discovery of linkages between microbial functional traits and the fast-slow continuum.
   4. Despite their historical isolation, collaborative work between functional ecologists and population ecologists could unlock novel research pathways. We call for an integrative research agenda to evaluate which and when traits are functional, as well as their ability to describe and predict life history strategies and population dynamics. We highlight promising, complementary research avenues to overcome current limitations. These include a more explicit linkage of selection gradients in the context of functional trait-vital rate relationships, and the implementation of standardised protocols to track changes in traits and vital rates over time at the same location and individuals, thus allowing for the explicit incorporation of trade-offs in analyses of covariation of functional traits and life-history traits.

AB Storage nitrogen (N) is a buffer pool for maintaining leaf growth and synthesizing photosynthetic proteins, but the dynamics of its forms within the life cycle of a single leaf and how it is influenced by N supply remain poorly understood. A field experiment was conducted to estimate the influence of N supply on leaf growth, photosynthetic characteristics, and N partitioning inthe sixth leaf of winter oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.) from emergence through senescence. Storage N content (N-store) decreased gradually along with leaf expansion. The relative growth rate based on leaf area (RGR(a)) was positively correlated with N-store during leaf expansion. The water-soluble protein form of storage N was the main N source for leaf expansion. After the leaves fully expanded, the net photosynthetic rate (A(n)) followed a linear-plateau response to N-store , with A(n) stabilizing at the highest value above a threshold and declining below the threshold. Non-protein and SDS (detergent)-soluble protein forms of storage N were the main N sources for maintaining photosynthesis. For the leaf N economy, storage N is used for co-ordinating leaf expansion and photosynthetic capacity. N supply can improve N-store, thereby promoting leaf growth and biomass.

AB Increased emissions of greenhouse gases have altered the global ambient temperature and adversely affected global climatic conditions. The municipal solid waste (MSW) generated by households is considered the third largest anthropogenic source of methane (CH4) emissions, constituting 11% of all global CH4 emissions. The current study derived total MSW CH4 emission estimates using the IPCC default method (DM), modified triangular method (MTM) and first order decay method (FOD). The estimated CH4 emission was higher for the DM than the other methods, and was comparable to estimates from other studies. This study observed that the net annual emission of CH4 from landfills in India increased from 404 Gg in 1999-2000 to 990 Gg and 1084 Gg in 2011 and 2015, respectively. We also found that CH4 emissions were highly correlated (R-2 = 0.8) with the gross state domestic product (GSDP) of states and the gross domestic product (GDP) of the country, which is an indicator of human well-being. The MSW management policy of India needs to be reviewed in a current policy context, as the management and efficient utilization of MSW technologies might help increase the use of CH4 as an energy source and thereby improve its sustainable and cost-effective management.

AB Secondary forests are increasingly dominant in human-modified tropical landscapes, but the drivers of forest recovery remain poorly understood. Soil conditions influence plant community composition, and are expected to change over a gradient of succession. However, the role of soil conditions as an environmental filter driving community assembly during forest succession has rarely been explicitly assessed. We evaluated the role of stand basal area and soil conditions on community assembly and its consequences for community functional properties along a chronosequence of Atlantic forest regeneration following sugar cane cultivation. Specifically, we tested whether community functional properties are related to stand basal area, soil fertility and soil moisture. Our expectations were that edaphic environmental filters play an increasingly important role along secondary succession by increasing functional trait convergence towards more conservative attributes. We sampled soil and woody vegetation features across 15 second-growth (3-30years) and 11 old-growth forest plots (300m(2) each). We recorded tree functional traits related to resource-use strategies (specific leaf area, SLA; leaf dry matter content, LDMC; leaf area, LA; leaf thickness, LT; and leaf succulence, LS) and calculated community functional properties using the community-weighted mean (CWM) of each trait and the functional dispersion (FDis) of each trait separately and all traits together. With exception of LA, all leaf traits were strongly associated with stand basal area; LDMC and SLA increased, while LT and LS decreased with forest development. Such changes in LDMC, LT and LS were also related to the decrease in soil nutrient availability and pH along succession, while soil moisture was weakly related to community functional properties. Considering all traits, as well as leaf thickness and succulence separately, FDis strongly decreased with increasing basal area and decreasing soil fertility along forest succession, presenting the lowest values in old-growth forests.Synthesis. Our findings suggest that tropical forest regeneration may be a deterministic process shaped by soil conditions. Soil fertility operates as a key filter causing functional convergence towards more conservative resource-use strategies, such as leaves with higher leaf dry matter content.

AB 1. Human selection, changes in environmental conditions and management practices drove the phenotypic trajectory of crops during domestication. The characterization of the crop domestication syndrome lies mostly on reproductive characters. However, biophysical and ecophysiological constraints during vegetative growth are also at play and can strongly impact crop phenotypes. It has been argued that a broadened examination of crop phenotypes through a functional trait-based lens should improve our understanding of the domestication syndrome.
   2. We used a collection of 39 genotypes representative of key steps during tetraploid wheat domestication and grew them in a common garden experiment. We quantified the vegetative phenotype of each genotype through the measurements of 13 functional traits related to root, leaf and whole-plant dimensions.
   3. In modern cultivars, compared to ancestral forms, leaf longevity was shorter, while net photosynthetic rate, leaf production rate and nitrogen content were higher. Modern cultivars had a shallower root system and exhibited a larger proportion of fine roots, preferring to invest biomass above-rather than below-ground. We found ancestral forms to be integrated phenotypes characterized by coordination between above-and below-ground functioning. Conversely, in modern forms, human selection appeared to have broken this coordination and to have generated a new type of network of trait covariations.
   4. Synthesis and applications. The examination of leaf, root and whole-plant traits of wheat accessions indicated a strong shift in plant functional strategies over the course of domestication. Elite genotypes tended to better optimize resource-use acquisition strategies than ancestral ones. The characterization of the crop phenotype based on vegetative traits thus suggests a much more complete domestication syndrome. Our findings highlight the benefits of using a functional trait-based characterization of crop phenotypes to document the extent of domestication syndrome and to further advance the agroecological management of cereals.

AB Temperature effects on enzyme kinetics and on the spatial distribution of microbial hotspots are important because they are crucial to soil organic matter decomposition. We Used soil zymography (in situ method for the two dimensional quantification of enzyme activities) to study the spatial distributions of enzymes responsible for P (phosphatase), C (cellobiohydrolase) and N (leucine-aminopeptidase) cycles in the rhizosphere (living roots of maize) and root-detritusphere (7 and 14 days after cutting shoots). Soil zymography was coupled with enzyme kinetics to test temperature effects (10, 20, 30 and 40 C) on the dynamics and localization of these three enzymes in the root-detritusphere. The percentage area of enzyme activity hotspots was 1.9-7.9 times larger and their extension was broader in the root-detritusphere compared to rhizosphere. From 10 to 30 C, the hotspot areas enlarged by a factor of 2 24 and V-max increased by 1.5-6.6 times; both, however, decreased at 40 C. For the first time, we found a close positive correlation between Vmax and the areas of enzyme activity hotspots, indicating that maximum reaction rate is coupled with hotspot formation. The substrate turnover time at 30 C were 1.7 6.7-fold faster than at 10 C. The Km of cellobiohydrolase and phosphatase significantly increased at 30 and 40 C, indicating low affinity between enzyme and substrate at warm temperatures. We conclude that soil warming (at least up to 30 C) increases hotspot areas of enzyme activity and the maximum reaction rate (V-max,) in the root-detritusphere. This, in turn, leads to faster substrate exhaustion and shortens the duration of hot moments.

AB Biodiversity has been elucidated to be one of the major factors sustaining ecosystem functioning. The vast majority of studies showing a relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning have come from experiments, and this knowledge has not yet been applied to most real-world cases of conservation and management. This is especially true in forest ecosystems, characterized by the dominance of long-lived organisms (trees) and high levels of structural complexity and environmental heterogeneity. To apply biodiversity-function relationships to actual forest management, there are several issues to be considered. These include employing a cross-taxon perspective, as some functions (e.g. soil biogeochemical processes) cannot be maintained by a narrow set of organisms, as is usually the case with experimental systems. More specifically, although the interaction between above- and below-ground diversity is important for many functions in forests, there are few studies that evaluated the roles of diversity in both subsystems in a manner that could be informative in practice. To evaluate the roles of above- and below-ground diversity to support natural soil ecosystem functions, we conducted a decomposition experiment in the northern forests of Japan, which are currently under restoration management. The restoration area consists of mosaics of different vegetation types by various revegetation activities and establishment of ungulate exclosures. Using structural equationmodelling and linear mixed-effects models, we assessed direct and indirect pathways from diversity to functions by focusing on both of taxonomic and functional diversity indices. To put our findings into practice, we utilized a trait-based approach, which provides a link between the functional consequences of human influences and ecosystem structure. We found little direct effects of tree diversity on below-ground functions such as decomposition rate and litter stabilization. However, once the diversities of understorey herbaceous plants and soil fungi were considered as a possible mediating explanatory factor, we found a significant effect of tree diversity to indirectly support these functions by supporting these other types of biodiversity. Particularly, we found that the models based on functional trait diversity, rather than on taxonomic species richness, best explained the variation in below-ground processes.Synthesis and applications. Forest restoration in the northern forests of Japan has had no explicit objective to restore soil functions. Nevertheless, afforestation, and the associated increase in tree diversity as a measure of forest restoration, was, although often unintentionally, proven effective for the maintenance of multiple ecosystem functions, such as soil biogeochemical processes. This finding suggests a great potential for management to make local tree assemblages functionally dissimilar and diverse for the sake of supporting and enhancing fundamental ecosystem functions in forests.

AB We analysed the driving forces of temporal change in the cover of boreal forest plant species in Finland over 21 years (1985-2006). Our study focused on the effects of forest cuttings of different intensity, i.e. regeneration cuttings (RC) and intermediate cuttings (IC), on 11 common understory species (including vascular plants, mosses and lichens) and their recovery after cuttings. General linear models (LM) were applied in modelling the change in the cover of plant species. The plant species displayed contrasting responses to RC and IC in accordance with their light demand, which also accounted for their recovery rate after cutting disturbance. After RC of old forest, shade and semi-shade tolerant species (herb Oxalis acetosella, moss Hylocomium splendens, dwarf shrub Vaccinium myrtillus) decreased strongly in cover (>70%) and recovered relatively slowly, but increased (40-100%) after IC. Species adapted to semi-light conditions (mosses Dicranum polysetum and Pleurozium schreberi, dwarf shrub Vaccinium vitis-idaea) decreased rather strongly (20-60%) after RC, but recovered relatively fast, reaching their old-forest cover level at a stand age of ca. 30 years. These species also increased after IC. In contrast, light-demanding species (dwarf shrubs Empetrum nigrum and Calluna vulgaris, grass Deschampsia flexuosa) increased after RC and decreased after IC. Cladina lichens decreased across the country. In general, early successional light-demanding species increased and late successional shade-tolerant species decreased after RC. IC favoured all but the most light-demanding species. Species-specific responses to cuttings showed considerable variation within plant functional groups (e.g. dwarf shrubs, herbs, mosses). Cuttings determined the principal change in vegetation, while only slight signals of the effect of climate warming were found in few species. The legacy of forest management deserves special attention when e.g. tracking the effect of global change on vegetation. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Aim The individual effects of climate and soil properties on functional trait distributions have become increasingly clear with recent syntheses of large datasets. However, the distribution of traits in a given climate may depend on the fertility of the soil. Our aim was to quantify how soil-climate interactions explain community-level variation in functional traits from every plant organ to improve predictions of plant community responses to environmental change.
   Location Temperate forests throughout New Zealand.
   Methods We measured traits of foliar, stem, root and reproductive tissue for 64 species and calculated abundance-weighted mean trait values on 324 forest plots. Multiple linear regression was used to model the variation in each of the traits as functions of mean annual temperature (MAT), vapour pressure deficit (VPD), soil pH, soil total phosphorus (P) and their interactions.
   Results Soil-climate interactions explained significant variation in functional traits. For example, specific leaf area (SLA) was highest in high-P soil within a wet and warm climate; however, strong interactions indicate that SLA was lowest in wet and warm climates in low-P soil. Root tissue density was lowest in warm climates and high-P soil, but it was high in warm climates and low-P soil and in cold climates and high-P soil. According to model predictions, the largest potential responses of vegetation to warming may occur in fertile and wet environments.
   Main conclusions Pervasive soil-climate interactions demonstrate that interpreting simple bivariate relationships between traits and climate must be done with caution because the adaptive value of traits in a given climate depends on the fertility of the soil. Predictions of vegetation responses to climate change will improve significantly by incorporating local-scale soil properties into modelling frameworks. Rising global temperatures may shift community-level trait values in opposite directions depending on whether the soil is fertile or infertile.

AB Although biogeographic patterns are the product of complex ecological processes, the increasing complexity of correlative species distribution models (SDMs) is not always motivated by ecological theory, but by model fit. The validity of model projections, such as shifts in a species' climatic niche, becomes questionable particularly during extrapolations, such as for future no-analog climate conditions. To examine the effects of model complexity on SDM predictive performance, we fit statistical models of varying complexity to simulated species occurrence data arising from data-generating processes that assume differing degrees of distributional symmetry in environmental space, interaction effects, and coverage in climate space. Mismatches between data-generating processes and statistical models (i.e., different functional forms) led to poor predictive performance when extrapolating to new climate-space and greater variation in extrapolated predictions for overly complex models. In contrast, performance issues were not apparent when using independent evaluation data from the training region. These results draw into question the use of highly flexible models for prediction without ecological justification. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Glacier retreat is a worldwide phenomenon with important consequences for the hydrological cycle and downstream ecosystem structure and functioning. To determine the effects of glacier retreat on aquatic communities, we conducted a 4-year flow manipulation in a tropical glacier-fed stream. Compared with an adjacent reference stream, meltwater flow reduction induces significant changes in benthic fauna community composition in less than 2 weeks. Also, both algal and herbivore biomass significantly increase in the manipulated stream as a response to flow reduction. After the flow reduction ceased, the system requires 14-16 months to return to its pre-perturbation state. These results are supported by a multi-stream survey of sites varying in glacial influence, showing an abrupt increase in algal and herbivore biomass below 11% glacier cover in the catchment. This study shows that flow reduction strongly affects glacier-fed stream biota, prefiguring profound ecological effects of ongoing glacier retreat on aquatic systems.

AB Large carnivores such as jaguars (Panthera onca) are species of conservation concern because they are suffering population declines and are keystone species in their ecosystems. Their large area requirements imply that unprotected and ever-increasing agricultural regions can be important habitats as they allow connectivity and dispersal among core protected areas. Yet information on jaguar densities across unprotected landscapes it is still scarce and crucially needed to assist management and range-wide conservation strategies. Our study provides the first jaguar density estimates of Colombia in agricultural regions which included cattle ranching, the main land use in the country, and oil palm cultivation, an increasing land use across the Neotropics. We used camera trapping across two agricultural landscapes located in the Magdalena River valley and in the Colombian llanos (47-53 stations respectively; >2000 trap nights at both sites) and classic and spatially explicit capture-recapture models with the sex of individuals as a covariate. Density estimates were 2.52 +/- 0.46-3.15 +/- 1.08 adults/100 km(2) in the Magdalena valley, whereas 1.12 +/- 0.13-2.19 +/- 0.99 adults/100 km(2) in the Colombian llanos, depending on analysis used. We suggest that jaguars are able to live across unprotected human-use areas and co-exist with agricultural landscapes including oil-palm plantations if natural areas and riparian habitats persist in the landscape and hunting of both jaguar and prey is limited. In the face of an expanding agriculture across the tropics we recommend land-use planning, adequate incentives, regulations, and good agricultural practices for range-wide jaguar connectivity and survival.

AB Meroplankton is often neglected in Arctic zooplankton studies, so our knowledge about their seasonal dynamics is limited. To investigate the highly dynamic nature of meroplankton, we sampled the zooplankton community in a high-Arctic fjord in West-Spitsbergen bi-weekly from December 2011 to December 2012. Five significantly different seasonal meroplankton assemblages were identified, representing winter, early spring, spring, summer and autumn. Meroplankton persistently dominated the zooplankton community during the productive seasons in both abundance (41-91%) and biomass (54-98%). Cirripedia and Bivalvia larvae occurred in particularly high numbers and dominated during spring and summer respectively. In the remaining seasons, the meroplankton diversity and abundance were comparatively poor, but interestingly Bryozoa larvae were present mainly during winter. Chlorophyll a and day length were identified as the main environmental variables structuring the meroplankton assemblage, followed by hydrography. Timing of the spring bloom determined the onset of the "meroplankton-boost" and from the observed hydrography, local rather than advective processes shaped the meroplankton community. Our investigation suggests that benthic invertebrate larvae play a significant role in the pelagic ecosystems in Arctic coastal regions, tightly linking the pelagic and benthic realms, thus deserving more attention in future studies.

AB River ecosystems are threatened by future changes in land use and climatic conditions. However, little is known of the influence of interactions of these two dominant global drivers of change on ecosystems. Does the interaction amplify (synergistic interaction) or buffer (antagonistic interaction) the impacts and does their interaction effect differ in magnitude, direction and spatial extent compared to single independent pressures. In this study, we model the impact of single and interacting effects of land use and climate change on the spatial distribution of 33 fish species in the Elbe River. The varying effects were modeled using step-wise boosted regression trees based on 250m raster grid cells. Species-specific models were built for both moderate' and extreme' future land use and climate change scenarios to assess synergistic, additive and antagonistic interaction effects on species losses, species gains and diversity indices and to quantify their spatial distribution within the Elbe River network. Our results revealed species richness is predicted to increase by 0.7-2.9 species by 2050 across the entire river network. Changes in species richness are likely to be spatially variable with significant changes predicted for 56-85% of the river network. Antagonistic interactions would dominate species losses and gains in up to 75% of the river network. In contrast, synergistic and additive effects would occur in only 20% and 16% of the river network, respectively. The magnitude of the interaction was negatively correlated with the magnitudes of the single independent effects of land use and climate change. Evidence is provided to show that future land use and climate change effects are highly interactive resulting in species range shifts that would be spatially variable in size and characteristic. These findings emphasize the importance of adaptive river management and the design of spatially connected conservation areas to compensate for these high species turnovers and range shifts.

AB Wood formation in European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) and Scots pine (Pious sylvestris L.) was intra-annually monitored to examine plastic responses of the xylem phenology according to altitude in one of the southernmost areas of their distribution range, i.e., in the Moncayo Natural Park, Spain. The monitoring was done from 2011 to 2013 at 1180 and 1580 m a.s.I., corresponding to the lower and upper limits of European beech forest in this region. Microcores containing phloem, cambium and xylem were collected biweekly from twenty-four trees from the beginning of March to the end of November to assess the different phases of wood formation. The samples were prepared for light microscopy to observe the following phenological phases: onset and end of cell production, onset and end of secondary wall formation in xylem cells and onset of cell maturation. The temporal dynamics of wood formation widely differed among years, altitudes and tree species. For Fagus sylvatica, the onset of cambial activity varied between the first week of May and the third week of June. Cambial activity then slowed down and stopped in summer, resulting in a length of growing season of 48-75 days. In contrast, the growing season for P sylvestris started earlier and cambium remained active in autumn, leading to a period of activity varying from 139-170 days. The intraannual wood -formation pattern is site and species -specific. Comparison with other studies shows a clear latitudinal trend in the duration of wood formation, positive for Fagus sylvatica and negative for P sylvestris.

AB Climate dynamics at diurnal, seasonal and inter-annual scales shape global fire activity, although difficulties of assembling reliable fire and meteorological data with sufficient spatio-temporal resolution have frustrated quantification of this variability. Using Australia as a case study, we combine data from 4760 meteorological stations with 12 years of satellite-derived active fire detections to determine day and night time fire activity, fire season start and end dates, and inter-annual variability, across 61 objectively defined climate regions in three climate zones (monsoon tropics, arid and temperate). We show that geographic patterns of landscape burning (onset and duration) are related to fire weather, resulting in a latitudinal gradient from the monsoon tropics in winter, through the arid zone in all seasons except winter, and then to the temperate zone in summer and autumn. Peak fire activity precedes maximum lightning activity by several months in all regions, signalling the importance of human ignitions in shaping fire seasons. We determined median daily McArthur forest fire danger index (FFDI50) for days and nights when fires were detected: FFDI50 varied substantially between climate zones, reflecting effects of fire management in the temperate zone, fuel limitation in the arid zone and abundance of flammable grasses in the monsoon tropical zone. We found correlations between the proportion of days when FFDI exceeds FFDI50 and the Southern Oscillation index across the arid zone during spring and summer, and Indian Ocean dipole mode index across south-eastern Australia during summer. Our study demonstrates that Australia has a long fire weather season with high inter-annual variability relative to all other continents, making it difficult to detect long term trends. It also provides a way of establishing robust baselines to track changes to fire seasons, and supports a previous conceptual model highlighting multi-temporal scale effects of climate in shaping continental-scale pyrogeography.

AB Global climate change is shifting species distributions worldwide. At rear edges (warmer, low latitude range margins), the consequences of small variations in environmental conditions can be magnified, producing large negative effects on species ranges. A major outcome of shifts in distributions that only recently received attention is the potential to reduce the levels of intra-specific diversity and consequently the global evolutionary and adaptive capacity of species to face novel disturbances. This is particularly important for low dispersal marine species, such as kelps, that generally retain high and unique genetic diversity at rear ranges resulting from long-term persistence, while ranges shifts during climatic glacial/interglacial cycles. Using ecological niche modelling, we (1) infer the major environmental forces shaping the distribution of a cold-temperate kelp, Laminaria hyperborea (Gunnerus) Foslie, and we (2) predict the effect of past climate changes in shaping regions of long-term persistence (i.e., climatic refugia), where this species might hypothetically harbour higher genetic diversity given the absence of bottlenecks and local extinctions over the long term. We further (3) assessed the consequences of future climate for the fate of L. hyperborea using different scenarios of greenhouse gas emissions (RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5). Results show NW Iberia, SW Ireland and W English Channel, Faroe Islands and S Iceland, as regions where L. hyperborea may have persisted during past climate extremes until present day. All predictions for the future showed expansions to northern territories coupled with the significant loss of suitable habitats at low latitude range margins, where long-term persistence was inferred (e.g., NW Iberia). This pattern was particularly evident in the most agressive scenario of climate change (RCP 8.5), likely driving major biodiversity loss, changes in ecosystem functioning and the impoverishment of the global gene pool of L. hyperborea. Because no genetic baseline is currently available for this species, our results may represent a first step in informing conservation and mitigation strategies. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Increasing exploitation effort and efficiency have been leading to population declines and extinctions among large marine animals. Understanding the magnitude of such losses is challenging because current baselines about species' abundances and distributions in the sea were mostly established after humans had started affecting marine populations. For artisanal fisheries, from which written historical records are rarely, if ever, available, approaches based on gathering anecdotal information from fishers' knowledge are a promising method to know the past environmental conditions. We interviewed coastal artisanal fishers, with ages varying from 15 to 85 years, to detect temporal changes in the catch abundance of large fish species, particularly the largetooth sawfish Pristis pristis and the goliath grouper Epinephelus itajara within Abrolhos Bank, Brazil. Most fishers considered that fishing has led to species depletion. However, older fishers reported significantly more species and larger species as depleted than young fishers. Older fishers caught significantly larger largetooth sawfish and goliath grouper in the past than younger fishers. The largetooth sawfish has not been caught or sought for more than 10 years. Probabilistic tests provided no definitive evidence for local extinction, although the past record of sightings indicates a population decline close to the threshold level for extinction probability. We provide evidence that small-scale artisanal fisheries can decimate the abundance of large coastal fishes, one of those almost close to local extinction. Finally, our results suggest that the younger generation is not aware of past ecological conditions, indicating the occurrence of a shifting baseline syndrome among the fishing community.

AB Hydraulic conductivity at and near saturation is difficult to predict. We investigated, for the first time, the potential of boosted regression trees to identify the key factors that determine saturated and near-saturated hydraulic conductivities in undisturbed soils with a global meta-database of tension infiltrometer measurements. Our results demonstrate that pedotransfer functions developed from meta-databases may strongly over-estimate prediction performance unless they are validated against each individual data source separately. For such a source-wise cross-validation, we estimated the hydraulic conductivity at a tension of 10cm (K-10) and the saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-s) with coefficients of determination of 0.36 and 0.15, respectively. The most important predictors for K-10 were the average annual precipitation and temperature at the measurement location, which are key variables for pedogenesis and constrain soil management. More research is required for the in-depth interpretation of their influence on hydraulic conductivity. The soil clay and organic carbon contents were also important predictors of K-10, with hydraulic conductivity decreasing as organic carbon contents increased up to 1.5% and as clay contents increased between about 10 and 40%. The direction of the tension-sequence with which the infiltrometer data were collected was also a significant predictor. Land use and bulk density were the most important predictors for K-s. The direction of the tension-sequence and the soil texture class were also important, with both coarse and fine-textured soils generally having larger K-s values than medium-textured soils.

AB The dangers posed to wooded environments from tree pests introduced by the expansion of international trade in live plants and the continued use of wood packaging in transporting materials have been widely accepted. A lack of awareness of the issues amongst key stakeholders involved in the movement of these materials can hamper an effective response as their unaltered behaviours continue to have unintended consequences. Better communication and engagement is needed to enrol this wider range of actors, such as plant buyers, traders and woodland owners, in preventative action or mitigation of tree pest impacts. However, as this review paper shows, current published evidence on awareness levels and effective engagement methods is limited, and lessons must be sought from research into other closely related issues such as invasive plants. We provide a summary of this available evidence, related to key stakeholder groupings, their levels of awareness and current modes of information provision and reception. It show what can at best be described as mediocre levels of awareness, and highlights the role of traditional media, such as television and newspapers, as sources of information. It further notes the urgent need for research to more fully map the tree health stakeholder landscape and to further our understanding of how to increase awareness and effect changes in behaviour.

AB Invasive species can affect the function and structure of natural ecological communities, hence understanding and predicting their potential for spreading is a major ecological challenge. Once established in a new region, the spread of invasive species is largely controlled by their dispersal capacity, local environmental conditions and species interactions. The mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis is native to the Mediterranean and is the most successful marine invader in southern Africa. Its distribution there has expanded rapidly and extensively since the 1970s, however, over the last decade its spread has ceased. In this study, we coupled broad scale field surveys, Ecological Niche Modelling (ENM) and Lagrangian Particle Simulations (LPS) to assess the current invaded distribution of M. galloprovincialis in southern Africa and to evaluate what prevents further spread of this species. Results showed that all environmentally suitable habitats in southern Africa have been occupied by the species. This includes rocky shores between Rocky Point in Namibia and East London in South Africa (approx. 2800 km) and these limits coincide with the steep transitions between cool-temperate and subtropical-warmer climates, on both west and southeast African coasts. On the west coast, simulations of drifting larvae almost entirely followed the northward and offshore direction of the Benguela current, creating a clear dispersal barrier by advecting larvae away from the coast. On the southeast coast, nearshore currents give larvae the potential to move eastwards, against the prevalent Agulhas current and beyond the present distributional limit, however environmental conditions prevent the establishment of the species. The transition between the cooler and warmer water regimes is therefore the main factor limiting the northern spread on the southeast coast; however, biotic interactions with native fauna may also play an important role.

AB Conservation outcomes are uncertain. Agencies making decisions about what threat mitigation actions to take to save which species frequently face the dilemma of whether to invest in actions with high probability of success and guaranteed benefits or to choose projects with a greater risk of failure that might provide higher benefits if they succeed. The answer to this dilemma lies in the decision maker's aversion to risktheir unwillingness to accept uncertain outcomes. Little guidance exists on how risk preferences affect conservation investment priorities. Using a prioritization approach based on cost effectiveness, we compared 2 approaches: a conservative probability threshold approach that excludes investment in projects with a risk of management failure greater than a fixed level, and a variance-discounting heuristic used in economics that explicitly accounts for risk tolerance and the probabilities of management success and failure. We applied both approaches to prioritizing projects for 700 of New Zealand's threatened species across 8303 management actions. Both decision makers' risk tolerance and our choice of approach to dealing with risk preferences drove the prioritization solution (i.e., the species selected for management). Use of a probability threshold minimized uncertainty, but more expensive projects were selected than with variance discounting, which maximized expected benefits by selecting the management of species with higher extinction risk and higher conservation value. Explicitly incorporating risk preferences within the decision making process reduced the number of species expected to be safe from extinction because lower risk tolerance resulted in more species being excluded from management, but the approach allowed decision makers to choose a level of acceptable risk that fit with their ability to accommodate failure. We argue for transparency in risk tolerance and recommend that decision makers accept risk in an adaptive management framework to maximize benefits and avoid potential extinctions due to inefficient allocation of limited resources.

AB The transition from the Last Glacial to the current Interglacial, the Holocene, represents an important period with climatic and environmental changes impacting ecosystems. In this study, we examined the interplay between the Indian Ocean Summer Monsoon (IOSM) and the Westerlies at lake Nam Co, southern Tibet to understand the climatic effects on the ecosystem. Different organic geochemical proxies (n-alkanes, glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers, delta D, delta(13)Corg, delta N-15) are applied to reconstruct the environmental and hydrological changes on one of the longest available paleorecords at the Tibetan Plateau. Based on our paleohydrological delta D proxies, the aquatic signal lags the terrestrial one due to specific ecological thresholds, which, in addition to climatic changes, can influence aquatic organisms. The aquatic organisms' response strongly depends on temperature and associated lake size, as well as pH and nutrient availability. Because the terrestrial vegetation reacts faster and more sensitively to changes in the monsoonal and climatic system, the delta D of n-C-29 and the reconstructed inflow water signal represent an appropriate IOSM proxy. In general, the interplay of the different air masses seems to be primarily controlled by solar insolation. In the Holocene, the high insolation generates a large land-ocean pressure gradient associated with strong monsoonal winds and the strongest IOSM. In the Last Glacial period, however, the weak insolation promoted the Westerlies, thereby increasing their influence at the Tibetan Plateau. Our results help to elucidate the variable IOSM, and they illustrate a remarkable shift in the lake system regarding pH, delta(13)Corg and delta N-15 from the Last Glacial to the Holocene interglacial period.

AB Geographical detector models provide a quantitative approach for evaluating spatial correlations among ecological factors, population density and landscape connectivity. Here, we used a geographical model to assess the influence of different gradients of urbanization, human activities and various environmental factors on the connectivity of urban forest landscapes in Xiamen, China from 1996 to 2006. Our overarching hypothesis is that human activity has modified certain ecological factors in a way that has affected the connectivity of urban forest landscapes. Therefore, spatiotemporal distributions of landscape connectivity should be similar to those of ecological factors and can be represented quantitatively. Integral indices of connectivity and population density were employed to represent urban forest landscape connectivity and human activity, respectively. We then simulated the spatial relationship between forest patches and population density with Conefor 2.6 software. A geographical detector model was used to identify the dominant factors that affect urban forest landscape connectivity. The results showed that a distance of 600 m was the threshold of node importance. Mean annual temperature, mean annual precipitation, elevation, patch area, population density and dominant species had significant effects on the node importance. Mean annual temperature was more significant than population density in controlling the spatial pattern of the delta of the integral index of connectivity (dIIC). The spatial interaction between population density and various ecological factors as well as their linearly enhanced or nonlinearity enhanced urban forest landscape connectivity. In conclusion, a combination of graph theory and geographical detector models is effective for quantitatively evaluating interactive relationships among ecological factors, population density and landscape connectivity.

AB Global pyrogeographic study is necessary to inform climate change impact assessments used for management and decision-making. Climate is a strong driver of spatial and temporal patterns of fire such that ongoing climate change is expected to alter global fire activity. A growing number of statistical-correlative analyses examine environmental drivers of current patterns of global fire occurrence or burned area, but few studies ask important what if questions about the potential future of fire under scenarios of a changing climate. Accordingly, our goal is to engage the broader statistical community in analysis of global fire data products to spur further understanding of fire regimes and the complex links they demonstrate between the biosphere and atmosphere. We provide an overview of constraints over fire regimes and the role of fire in the biosphere-atmosphere, describe general approaches being used for global fire-climate assessment, summarize opportunities and pitfalls in the public-access global fire datasets, and highlight thinking on next steps for analysis of global fire and fire regime data.

AB Conceptual and phenomenological macroecological models of current global fire activity have demonstrated the overwhelming control exerted by primary productivity. Fire activity is very high in savanna regions with intermediate primary productivity, and very low in both densely forested regions with high productivity and arid/cold regions with low productivity. However, predicting future global fire activity using such macroecological models of fire's global niche' may not be possible because of the feedbacks between fire, climate and vegetation that underpin the fire-productivity relationship. Improving forecasts of global fire activity demands the use of dynamic models to determine how climate, CO2, vegetation (i.e. canopy closure and plant functional types) and primary productivity constrain fire and evaluation of the strength of feedbacks amongst these variables.

AB In this study, we investigated the termites of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, one of the most threatened biodiversity hotspots in the world, in regularly spaced sites from 7 degrees S to 27 degrees S latitude. To our knowledge, this is the only report of a latitudinal survey of termites at species level performed with a standardized sampling protocol. We evaluate termite diversity and abundance, and describe patterns of species composition based on feeding groups along the latitudinal gradient. We also describe the relative contribution of environmental variables to explain diversity patterns. Termite assemblages were investigated by standardized surveys at 15 Atlantic Forest sites, on six transects divided into five sections of 10 m(2), with 30 sections per site (or 300 m(2)/site), which were investigated by one trained person for one hour. Observed species richness and abundance were negatively correlated with latitude. The influence of latitude was explained mainly by variables related to temperature, precipitation and ambient energy (potential evapotranspiration). Our results also suggest that temperature exerts a greater constraint on Atlantic Forest termites than productivity, because ambient productivity increases with latitude in this forest but termite diversity decreases. Termite species richness in the Atlantic Forest showed a different pattern than those described for other organisms, increasing in diversity where the coastal-forest strip narrows. Overall, our results indicate comparatively high termite species richness at northeastern sites and a significant impoverishment of termite assemblages in the southeastern and southern regions of the Atlantic Forest.

AB Freshwater is the essential resource element to support and ensure human life and regional sustainable development. On the basis of the concept of ecosystem service footprint proposed by Burkhard, in this paper, we introduce a new methodological approach that addresses the sustainability and capability of regional freshwater provision and consumption, which we have coined freshwater ecosystem service footprint model (FESF model). The FESF model enhances the accuracy of water provision and consumption calculations and reveals a spatial-pattern of freshwater ecosystem service footprint at the watershed scale, overcoming the shortcomings of the traditional water footprint model, which was first introduced by Rees and Wackernagel in 1992. The proposed model is tested in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) freshwater supply area in China, where water use restrictions are regularly imposed on the population and economic activities. The results of the physical process and theoretical analysis reveal that FESF model is a reliable and helpful model for researchers to understand the regional freshwater situation. The average FESF is 0.94 hectare per capita in BTH, with a maximum of 2.52 hectare per capita and a minimum of 0.36 hectare per capita. Approximately 16.8% of the considered region, primarily parts of the mid-northern region and the surrounding eastern and southern low-lying regions, is under high freshwater resource pressure. In conclusion, this model can be used by researchers and policymakers for promoting sustainable human-ecology interactions. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Marine biodiversity reaches its pinnacle in the tropical Indo-Pacific region, with high levels of both species richness and endemism, especially in coral reef habitats. While this pattern of biodiversity has been known to biogeographers for centuries, causal mechanisms remain enigmatic. Over the past 20 yrs, genetic markers have been employed by many researchers as a tool to elucidate patterns of biodiversity above and below the species level, as well as to make inferences about the underlying processes of diversification, demographic history, and dispersal. In a quantitative, comparative framework, these data can be synthesized to address questions about this bewildering diversity by treating species as "replicates." However, the sheer size of the Indo-Pacific region means that the geographic and genetic scope of many species' data sets are not complementary. Here, we describe data sets from 116 Indo-Pacific species (108 studies). With a mind to future synthetic investigations, we consider the strengths and omissions of currently published population genetic data for marine fauna of the Indo-Pacific region, as well as the geographic and taxonomic scope of the data, and suggest some ways forward for data collection and collation.

AB Oligotrophic regions are expected to host low densities of top predators. Nevertheless, top predators with contrasting energetic costs might respond differently to the productivity of their habitats. Predators with high energetic demands might be constrained to select the most productive habitats to meet their high energetic requirements, whereas less active predators would be able to satisfy their needs by exploiting either high or low productivity habitats. Although situated in the core of the South Pacific oligotrophic gyre, French Polynesia is characterized by a fairly marked productivity gradient from the extremely oligotrophic Australs area to the more productive Marquesas area. The aim of this study was to investigate cetacean and seabird habitats in French Polynesia in light of their general energetic constraints. We collected cetacean and seabird sightings from an aerial survey across French Polynesian waters during the austral summer 2011. We classified cetaceans and seabirds into energetic guilds according to the literature. For each guild, we built generalized additive models along with static covariates and oceanographic covariates at the seasonal and climatological resolutions. We provided regional habitat predictions for Delphininae, Globicephalinae, sperm and beaked whales, tropicbirds, grey terns, noddies, white terns, boobies, petrels and shearwaters, sooty terns and frigatebirds. Explained deviances ranged from 5% to 30% for cetaceans and from 14% to 29% for seabirds. Cetaceans clearly responded to the productivity gradient, with the highest predicted densities around the productive waters of the Marquesas. However, Delphininae and Globicephalinae, characterized by higher energetic demands, depended more strongly on productivity, showing a ratio of 1-26 and 1-31 between their lowest and highest density areas respectively, compared to the less active sperm and beaked whales (showing only a ratio of 1-3.5 in predicted densities). In contrast, seabird distributions appeared more governed by the availability of nesting and roosting sites than by energetic constraints. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Wildfires are common disturbances that have a major impact on ecosystems. Recent decades have seen an increase in fire frequency and extension due to the combined effects of climate change and land-use history. We studied the taxonomic and functional response of a reptile assemblage to repeated fires in southern France to understand shifts in dominant species and diversity, as well as the mechanisms that underlie responses according to functional traits of species. In the spring of 2010, we sampled reptiles in areas with three types of fire regime: unburned, burned once (2003) and burned 4-5 times (last fire in 2003) along a fire history of 51-years period. With this field sampling design, we examined the intermediate disturbance hypothesis and the habitat accommodation model of succession as methods to predict reptile responses to natural fire regimes. We also compared habitat structure at the study area between 1944 and 2006 to certify that repeated-fire regimes have modified the habitat for reptiles. The comparison of the habitat structure between both periods demonstrated that repeated-fire regimes modified the landscape from a homogeneous sparse forest to a contrasted heterogeneous mixture of scrubland and dense forest. We found a loss of reptile diversity after one and multiple fires, a result that contradicts the intermediate disturbance hypothesis. Reptile composition differed among the three fire regimes: there was a shift in dominant species and a reduction of beta diversity related to an increase in the number of fires. We also observed a functional response to repeated fires, with an increased frequency of insectivorous reptiles, which live in open areas, are specialists in their ecological niche, and have a short lifespan. These results suggest that reptile replacement according to fire regime accounts for a habitat accommodation model following particular traits of species. Our study indicated that areas subjected to repeated fires have a more strictly Mediterranean reptile assemblage than unburned areas, due to the ability of Mediterranean species to survive thermal environments in open (burned) areas. At a regional scale, changes in dominant species between unburned and repeatedly burned areas might be an argument for maintaining a patchwork of areas burned at variable intervals. However, the increase in fire frequency and extension suggests a future scenario of extinction for species negatively impacted by fire, such as the endangered Hermann's tortoise Testudo hermanni, for which the study area is home to one of the last native populations in the western Mediterranean.

AB The climatic cycles of the Quaternary, during which global mean annual temperatures have regularly changed by 5-10 degrees C, provide a special opportunity for studying the rate, magnitude, and effects of geographic responses to changing climates. During the Quaternary, high- and mid-latitude species were extirpated from regions that were covered by ice or otherwise became unsuitable, persisting in refugial retreats where the environment was compatible with their tolerances. In this study we combine modern geographic range data, phylogeny, Pleistocene paleoclimatic models, and isotopic records of changes in global mean annual temperature, to produce a temporally continuous model of geographic changes in potential habitat for 59 species of North American turtles over the past 320 Ka (three full glacial-interglacial cycles). These paleophylogeographic models indicate the areas where past climates were compatible with the modern ranges of the species and serve as hypotheses for how their geographic ranges would have changed in response to Quaternary climate cycles. We test these hypotheses against physiological, genetic, taxonomic and fossil evidence, and we then use them to measure the effects of Quaternary climate cycles on species distributions. Patterns of range expansion, contraction, and fragmentation in the models are strongly congruent with (i) phylogeographic differentiation; (ii) morphological variation; (iii) physiological tolerances; and (iv) intraspecific genetic variability. Modern species with significant interspecific differentiation have geographic ranges that strongly fluctuated and repeatedly fragmented throughout the Quaternary. Modern species with low genetic diversity have geographic distributions that were highly variable and at times exceedingly small in the past. Our results reveal the potential for paleophylogeographic models to (i) reconstruct past geographic range modifications, (ii) identify geographic processes that result in genetic bottlenecks; and (iii) predict threats due to anthropogenic climate change in the future.

AB The production of agricultural commodities faces increased risk of pests, diseases and other stresses due to climate change and variability. This study assesses the potential distribution of agricultural pests under projected climatic scenarios using evidence from the African coffee white stem borer (CWB), Monochamus leuconotus (Pascoe) (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae), an important pest of coffee in Zimbabwe. A species distribution modeling approach utilising Boosted Regression Trees (BRT) and Generalized Linear Models (GLM) was applied on current and projected climate data obtained from the WorldClim database and occurrence data (presence and absence) collected through on-farm biological surveys in Chipinge, Chimanimani, Mutare and Mutasa districts in Zimbabwe. Results from both the BRT and GLM indicate that precipitation-related variables are more important in determining species range for the CWB than temperature related variables. The CWB has extensive potential habitats in all coffee areas with Mutasa district having the largest model average area suitable for CWB under current and projected climatic conditions. Habitat ranges for CWB will increase under future climate scenarios for Chipinge, Chimanimani and Mutare districts while it will decrease in Mutasa district. The highest percentage change in area suitable for the CWB was for Chimanimani district with a model average of 49.1% (3 906 ha) increase in CWB range by 2080. The BRT and GLM predictions gave similar predicted ranges for Chipinge, Chimanimani and Mutasa districts compared to the high variation in current and projected habitat area for CWB in Mutare district. The study concludes that suitable area for CWB will increase significantly in Zimbabwe due to climate change and there is need to develop adaptation mechanisms.

AB Many plant species combine sexual and clonal reproduction. Clonal propagation has ecological costs mainly related to inbreeding depression and pollen discounting; at the same time, species able to reproduce clonally have ecological and evolutionary advantages being able to persist when conditions are not favorable for sexual reproduction. The presence of clonality has profound consequences on the genetic structure of populations, especially when it represents the predominant reproductive strategy in a population. Theoretical studies suggest that high rate of clonal propagation should increase the effective number of alleles and heterozygosity in a population, while an opposite effect is expected on genetic differentiation among populations and on genotypic diversity. In this study, we ask how clonal propagation affects the genetic diversity of rare insular species, which are often characterized by low levels of genetic diversity, hence at risk of extinction. We used eight polymorphic microsatellite markers to study the genetic structure of the critically endangered insular endemic Ruta microcarpa. We found that clonality appears to positively affect the genetic diversity of R. microcarpa by increasing allelic diversity, polymorphism, and heterozygosity. Moreover, clonal propagation seems to be a more successful reproductive strategy in small, isolated population subjected to environmental stress. Our results suggest that clonal propagation may benefit rare species. However, the advantage of clonal growth may be only short-lived for prolonged clonal growth could ultimately lead to monoclonal populations. Some degree of sexual reproduction may be needed in a predominantly clonal species to ensure long-term viability.

AB This Special Feature on sustainable land-use practices in European mountain regions presents results from the inter- and transdisciplinary research project MOUNTLAND. The goal was to investigate the sensitivity of the provision of ecosystem services to both climatic and land-use changes and to suggest alternative policies and governance structures for mitigating the impact of such changes and enhancing sustainable management practices in mountain regions. The individual articles provide: (1) new scientific findings regarding the impacts of climate and land-use changes on ecosystem processes in three sensitive mountain regions of Switzerland; (2) an assessment of the feedback effects arising from changing socioeconomic and political conditions, land use, and adaptation to climate change, using modeling techniques and transdisciplinary stakeholder interactions; and (3) suggestions for alternative policy solutions to ensure sustainable land use in mountain regions. In our synthesis of the project, we provide insights from the ecological, socioeconomic, and political sciences in the context of human-environment interactions in mountain regions. The innovation of this Special Feature lies in the fact that all articles present truly inter- or transdisciplinary research, ranging from natural sciences to economics and political sciences, based on an overarching set of unifying research questions.

AB Roads affect wildlife in many direct and indirect ways. For ungulates, roads may inhibit seasonal migration and may cause an effective loss of habitat due to avoidance. On the other hand, roadsides and associated agricultural lands offer high quality forage that may attract ungulates and increase the frequency of car accidents. Mitigating actions require detailed knowledge on space use in relation to roads. Using data from 67 global positioning system (GPS)-marked red deer in Norway, we quantified 1) scale of avoidance of roads, 2) crossing frequency, and 3) selection of crossing sites. Red deer avoided roads only on a very local scale and only during daytime, with minor influence of variation in road size (traffic burden). Marked red deer crossed roads, on average, 2 times per day. Females crossed more frequently than males and crossings were most frequent during autumn and winter and during night. Deer selected forested crossing sites close to agricultural pastures, reflecting that roads are crossed most often on nightly feeding excursions. Our findings imply that red deer in our study area have adjusted to exploit feeding habitat close to roads at times of low traffic burden. The high frequency of crossings suggests a limited influence on seasonal migration patterns. The frequency at which red deer cross highways suggests that mitigation measures to reduce road mortality may be effective if targeted in the right areas. (c) 2012 The Wildlife Society.

AB During the anomalously hot summer in 2012, surface air temperatures in Western Siberia were 5 to 15 degrees C higher than those observed during the previous period of > 30 yr. This unusual climate phenomenon provided an opportunity to examine the effects of short-term natural heating of water in thermokarst ponds and lakes in discontinuous permafrost zones and compare these observations to previous field results obtained when the temperature was normal during the summer of 2010 in the same region. In 2012, thermokarst bodies of water shrank significantly, water levels dropped approximately 50 cm in large lakes and small (< 10-100 m(2)) ponds, and shallow soil depressions disappeared. Based on samples from similar to 40 bodies of water collected previously and in 2012, first-order features of changes in chemical composition in response to increased water temperatures (from 14.1 +/- 2.2 to 23.8 +/- 2.3 degrees C in 2010 and 2012, respectively) were established. In these thermokarst bodies of water that covered a full range of surface areas, the average conductivity and pH were almost unchanged, whereas dissolved organic carbon (DOC), Cl- and SO42- concentrations were higher by a factor of similar to 2 during summer 2012 compared to periods with normal temperatures. Similarly, most divalent metals and insoluble trivalent and tetravalent elements were more concentrated by a factor of 1.7-2.4 in the summer of 2012 than normal periods. The average concentrations of dissolved CO2 and CH4 during the hot summer of 2012 increased by factors of 1.4 and 4.9, respectively. For most of the trace elements bound to colloids, the degree of colloidal binding decreased by a factor of 1.44 +/- 0.33 (for an average of 40 elements) during the hot summer of 2012 compared to normal periods. Increases in CO2 and CH4 concentrations with the decreasing size of the body of water were well-pronounced during the hot summer of 2012. The concentrations of CO2 and CH4 rose by factors of 5 and 150, respectively, in small (<= 10(2) m(2)) compared to large (>= 10(4) m(2)) thermokarst (thaw) lakes. Taken together, these trends suggest that, for a conservative scenario of lake size distribution, lake water warming at high latitudes will produce (1) a significant increase in methane emission capacity from thaw lake surfaces; (2) decreased molecular sizes of trace element complexes and potential bioavailability of metal micronutrients in water columns; and (3) relatively conservative responses by CO2, DOC and trace element concentrations.

AB Gobies (Teleostei: Gobiidae) are an extremely diverse and widely distributed group and are the second most species rich family of vertebrates. Ecological drivers are key to the evolutionary success of the Gobiidae. However, ecological and phylogenetic data are lacking for many diverse genera of gobies. Our study investigated the evolution of microhabitat association across the phylogeny of 18 species of dwarfgobies (genus Eviota), an abundant and diverse group of coral reef fishes. In addition, we also explore the evolution of pectoral fin-ray branching and sensory head pores to determine the relationship between morphological evolution and microhabitat shifts. Our results demonstrate that Eviota species switched multiple times from a facultative hard-coral association to inhabiting rubble or mixed sand/rubble habitat. We found no obvious relationship between microhabitat shifts and changes in pectoral fin-ray branching or reduction in sensory pores, with the latter character being highly homoplasious throughout the genus. The relative flexibility in coral-association in Eviota combined with the ability to move into non-coral habitats suggests a genetic capacity for ecological release in contrast to the strict obligate coral-dwelling relationship commonly observed in closely related coral gobies, thus promoting co-existence through fine scale niche partitioning. The variation in microhabitat association may facilitate opportunistic ecological speciation, and species persistence in the face of environmental change. This increased speciation opportunity, in concert with a high resilience to extinction, :nay explain the exceptionally high diversity seen in Eviota compared to related genera in the family.

AB The grey wolves (Canis lupus) of Finland have had a varied history, with a period of rapid population expansion after the mid-1990s followed by a decline with a current census size of about 140 wolves. Here, we investigate the impact of unstable population size and connectivity on genetic diversity and structure in a long-term genetic study of 298 Finnish wolves born in 19952009 and genotyped for 17 microsatellite loci. During the initial recovery and prior to population expansion, genetic diversity was high (19951997: LD-Ne=67.2; Ho=0.749; He=0.709) despite a small census size and low number of breeders (Nc<100; Nb<10) likely reflecting the status of the Russian source population. Surprisingly, observed heterozygosity decreased significantly during the study period (t=-2.643, P=0.021) despite population expansion, likely a result of an increase in inbreeding (FIS=0.108 in 20072009) owing to a low degree of connectivity with adjacent Russian wolf population (m=0.0160.090; FST=0.086, P<0.001) and population crash after 2006. However, population growth had a temporary positive impact on Ne and number of family lines. This study shows that even strong population growth alone might not be adequate to retain genetic diversity, especially when accompanied with low amount of subsequent gene flow and population decline.

AB Warming of the permafrost accompanied by the release of ancient soil organic carbon is one of the most significant environmental threats within the global climate change scenario. While the main sites of permafrost carbon processing and its release to the atmosphere are thermokarst (thaw) lakes and ponds, the main carriers of carbon and related major and trace elements from the land to the Arctic ocean are Russian subarctic rivers. The source of carbon in these rivers is atmospheric C consumed by chemical weathering of rocks and amplified by plant uptake and litter decomposition. This multidisciplinary study describes results of more than a decade of observations and measurements of elements fluxes, stocks and mechanisms in the Russian boreal and subarctic zone, from Karelia region to the Kamchatka peninsula, along the gradient of permafrost-free terrain to continuous permafrost settings, developed on various lithology and vegetation types. We offer a comprehensive, geochemically-based view on the functioning of aquatic boreal systems which quantifies the role of the following factors on riverine element fluxes: (1) the specificity of lithological substrate; (2) the importance of organic and organo-mineral colloidal forms, notably during the snowmelt season; (3) the phenomenon of lakes seasonal overturn; (4) the role of permafrost within the small and large watersheds; and (5) the governing role of terrestrial vegetation in element mobilization from rock substrate to the river. Care of such a multiple approach, a first order prediction of the evolution of element stocks and fluxes under scenario of progressive warming in high latitudes becomes possible. It follows the increase of frozen peat thawing in western Siberia will increase the stocks of elements in surface waters by a factor of 3 to 10 whereas the increase of the thickness of active layer, the biomass and the primary productivity all over permafrost-affected zone will bring about a short-term increase of elements stocks in labile reservoir (plant litter) and riverine fluxes by a factor of 2. The change of the plant productivity and community composition under climate warming in central Siberia will be the most important factor of major and trace element fluxes increase (probably a factor of 2) from the soil to the river and, finally, to the Arctic Ocean.

AB Meta-analyses are an increasingly used set of statistical tools that allow for data from multiple studies to be drawn together allowing broader, more generalizable conclusions. The extent to which the increase in the number of meta-analyses in ecology, relative to other types of papers, has influenced how questions are asked and the current state of knowledge has not been assessed before. Here, we gauge the impact of meta-analyses in ecology quantitatively and qualitatively. For the quantitative assessment, we conducted an analysis of 240 published meta-analyses to examine trends in ecological meta-analyses. Our examination shows that publication rates of meta-analyses in ecology have increased through time, and that more recent meta-analyses have been more comprehensive, including more studies and a greater temporal range of studies. Meta-analyses in ecology are the result of larger collaborations with meta-analyses being authored by larger teams than other studies, and those funded by collaborative centers have even larger collaborations. These larger collaborations result in a larger scope and scale of the analyses-by using more papers, datasets, species and years of data. Qualitatively, we discuss three examples: the strength of competition, the nature of how biodiversity affects ecosystem function, and the response of species to global climate change, where meta-analyses supplied the critical evaluation of accepted ecological explanations. As scientific criticism and controversy mount, the true power of meta-analyses is to serve as the capstone evidence supporting the validity of an explanation and to possibly herald the shift to other potential explanations.

AB Given the major changes that rural areas have undergone, and are continuing to undergo, serious problems of achieving sustainable development are being experienced. These changes have multiple characters, varying from changes in ecosystem conditions to changes in socio-economic impacts, due to, for example, food- and financial crises. Nowadays, there is an increasing awareness of the need to develop rural policies that support adaptive strategies of stakeholders in response to a disturbance. We propose that resilience thinking offers a framework that could be helpful in the governance of rural changes. This framework is based on the complexity of the social-ecological system and takes into account the unpredictable future, as it emphasizes adaptive approaches to management. As such, it helps evaluate to what extent rural development policies contribute to the resilience of rural areas. Nine criteria were developed including thirteen specifications. In order to evaluate the usability and usefulness of the proposed framework, a case study has been performed that specifically investigated the degree of resilience of a European rural development policy (i.e. the spending of extra funds generated through compulsory modulation under the 2009 Health Check in the Netherlands).

AB Aim Elucidating the environmental limits of coral reefs is central to projecting future impacts of climate change on these ecosystems and their global distribution. Recent developments in species distribution modelling (SDM) and the availability of comprehensive global environmental datasets have provided an opportunity to reassess the environmental factors that control the distribution of coral reefs at the global scale as well as to compare the performance of different SDM techniques. Location Shallow waters world-wide. Methods The SDM methods used were maximum entropy (Maxent) and two presence/absence methods: classification and regression trees (CART) and boosted regression trees (BRT). The predictive variables considered included sea surface temperature (SST), salinity, aragonite saturation state (OArag), nutrients, irradiance, water transparency, dust, current speed and intensity of cyclone activity. For many variables both mean and SD were considered, and at weekly, monthly and annually averaged time-scales. All were transformed to a global 1 degrees x 1 degrees grid to generate coral reef probability maps for comparison with known locations. Model performance was compared in terms of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and area under the curve (AUC) scores. Potential geographical bias was explored via misclassification maps of false positive and negative errors on test data. Results Boosted regression trees consistently outperformed other methods, although Maxent also performed acceptably. The dominant environmental predictors were the temperature variables (annual mean SST, and monthly and weekly minimum SST), followed by, and with their relative importance differing between regions, nutrients, light availability and OArag. No systematic bias in SDM performance was found between major coral provinces, but false negatives were more likely for cells containing marginal non-reef-forming coral communities, e.g. Bermuda. Main conclusions Agreement between BRT and Maxent models gives predictive confidence for exploring the environmental limits of coral reef ecosystems at a spatial scale relevant to global climate models (c. 1 degrees x 1 degrees). Although SST-related variables dominate the coral reef distribution models, contributions from nutrients, OArag and light availability were critical in developing models of reef presence in regions such as the Bahamas, South Pacific and Coral Triangle. The steep response in SST-driven probabilities at low temperatures indicates that latitudinal expansion of coral reef habitat is very sensitive to global warming.

AB Parrotfishes and surgeonfishes perform important functional roles in the dynamics of coral reef systems. This is a consequence of their varied feeding behaviors ranging from targeted consumption of living plant material (primarily surgeonfishes) to feeding on detrital aggregates that are either scraped from the reef surface or excavated from the deeper reef substratum (primarily parrotfishes). Increased fishing pressure and widespread habitat destruction have led to population declines for several species of these two groups. Species-specific data on global distribution, population status, life history characteristics, and major threats were compiled for each of the 179 known species of parrotfishes and surgeonfishes to determine the likelihood of extinction of each species under the Categories and Criteria of the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Due in part to the extensive distributions of most species and the life history traits exhibited in these two families, only three (1.7%) of the species are listed at an elevated risk of global extinction. The majority of the parrotfishes and surgeonfishes (86%) are listed as Least Concern, 10% are listed as Data Deficient and 1% are listed as Near Threatened. The risk of localized extinction, however, is higher in some areas, particularly in the Coral Triangle region. The relatively low proportion of species globally listed in threatened Categories is highly encouraging, and some conservation successes are attributed to concentrated conservation efforts. However, with the growing realization of man's profound impact on the planet, conservation actions such as improved marine reserve networks, more stringent fishing regulations, and continued monitoring of the population status at the species and community levels are imperative for the prevention of species loss in these groups of important and iconic coral reef fishes.

AB Although an understanding of mating systems is thought to be an important component of long-term population management, these life history characteristics are poorly known in sharks. Here, we employ polymorphic microsatellite markers to test for the occurrence and prevalence of multiple paternity in a population of the brown smoothhound shark, Mustelus henlei. We analyzed litters from 14 females sampled from the Pacific coast of Baja California Sur. The minimum number of sires ranged from one to three with an average of 2.3 sires per litter. Regression analyses did not indicate a relationship between female body size and number of sires, or female body size and size of the litter. A review of the existing literature on genetic mating systems in sharks suggests that polyandry may be common and that reproductive behavior may have evolved from conflicting selection pressures between the sexes.

AB 1. Issues with ecological data (e.g. non-normality of errors, nonlinear relationships and autocorrelation of variables) and modelling (e.g. overfitting, variable selection and prediction) complicate regression analyses in ecology. Flexible models, such as generalized additive models (GAMs), can address data issues, and machine learning techniques (e.g. gradient boosting) can help resolve modelling issues. Gradient boosted GAMs do both. Here, we illustrate the advantages of this technique using data on benthic macroinvertebrates and fish from 1573 small streams in Maryland, USA.
   2. We assembled a predictor matrix of 15 watershed attributes (e. g. ecoregion and land use), 15 stream attributes (e. g. width and habitat quality) and location (latitude and longitude). We built boosted and conventionally estimated GAMs for macroinvertebrate richness and for the relative abundances of macroinvertebrates in the Orders Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera (% EPT); individuals that cling to substrate (% Clingers); and individuals in the collector/gatherer functional feeding group (% Collectors). For fish, models were constructed for taxonomic richness, benthic species richness, biomass and the relative abundance of tolerant individuals (% Tolerant Fish).
   3. For several of the responses, boosted GAMs had lower pseudo R-s(2) than conventional GAMs for in-sample data but larger pseudo R-s(2) for out-of-bootstrap data, suggesting boosted GAMs do not overfit the data and have higher prediction accuracy than conventional GAMs. The models explained most variation in fish richness (pseudo R-2 = 0 97), least variation in % Clingers (pseudo R-2 = 0 28) and intermediate amounts of variation in the other responses (pseudo R(2)s between 0.41 and 0.60). Many relationships of macroinvertebrate responses to anthropogenic measures and natural watershed attributes were nonlinear. Fish responses were related to system size and local habitat quality.
   4. For impervious surface, models predicted below model-average macroinvertebrate richness at levels above c.3 0%, lower % EPT above c. 1 5%, and lower % Clingers for levels above c.2 0%. Impervious surface did not affect% Collectors or any fish response. Prediction functions for% EPT and fish richness increased linearly with log(10) (watershed area), % Tolerant Fish decreased with log(10) (watershed area), and benthic fish richness and biomass both increased nonlinearly with log(10) (watershed area).
   5. Gradient boosting optimizes the predictive accuracy of GAMs while preserving the structure of conventional GAMs, so that predictor-response relationships are more interpretable than with other machine learning methods. Boosting also avoids overfitting the data (by shrinking effect estimates towards zero and by performing variable selection), thus avoiding spurious predictor effects

AB The relative influence of the factors acting on burn probability, namely fuel and weather, is not well understood, especially in Europe. We use a digital fire atlas (1975-2008) and apply survival analysis to individual fires (1998-2008) to describe how burn probability changes with fuel age in Portugal. The typical fire return interval and median fire-free interval vary regionally from 23 to 52 and 18 to 47 years. Increase of the hazard of burning with time is generally near-linear, denoting moderate fuel-age dependency, as in some other shrub-dominated Mediterranean environments. Analysis of complete fire intervals resulted in shorter fire return interval and higher fuel-age dependency of burn probability than findings that included censored observations. Increasingly severe weather conditions either expressed through fire size or by extreme fire danger concurrently decreased fuel-age dependency and selected older fuels. The results are discussed from the viewpoints of fire suppression and fuel treatments.

AB A combined analysis of plant trait responses to the environment, and their effects on ecosystem properties has recently been proposed. In this study, we related the trait composition of plant communities to soil nutrients and disturbance as environmental drivers and to productivity, decomposition and soil carbon as ecosystem properties. We surveyed two sites, one comprising intensively grazed and fertilized grasslands, the other consisting of semi-natural grassland and open heathland. Species abundance and trait values of 149 species were recorded in 69 plots, as well as parameters describing soil resources, land-use disturbances, and ecosystem properties. Our main goal was to test whether the average or the diversity of the trait values of the vegetation had stronger effects on ecosystem properties (mass ratio vs. diversity hypothesis). Structural equation modeling was used to perform a simultaneous analysis of trait responses and effects. Specific leaf area and leaf nutrient contents were always negatively correlated with stem dry matter content and canopy height, indicating greater investments in supportive and nutrient-conserving tissue as plants increased in size. In the agricultural site, disturbance was the single most important factor decreasing plant height, while leaf traits such as specific leaf area and leaf nutrient contents increased with soil resources in heathlands. Productivity was directly or indirectly driven by leaf traits, and investments in structural tissue increased standing biomass and soil carbon. Different environmental drivers in the two sites produced opposing leaf trait effects on litter decomposition. Ecosystem properties were explained by the community mean trait value as predicted by the mass ratio hypothesis. Evidence for effects of functional diversity on productivity and other ecosystem properties was not detected, suggesting that diversity productivity relationships depend on the length of the investigated environmental gradients. We conclude that changes in community composition and dominance hierarchies deserve the most attention when ecosystem properties must he maintained.

AB Roads represent an important landscape element affecting both biotic and abiotic components. Alteration of soil properties along roads (addition of nutrients) is assumed to have a great impact on vegetation structure especially in nutrient poor ecosystems. Existing studies focus mainly on road dust. In our study we assessed the overall effects of roads upon adjacent alpine tundra vegetation and soils in Krkonose Mts, Czech Republic. Our aims were to (1) reconstruct the road-related changes using aerial data and GPS mapping to study colonization of roadside plant species; (2) assess the road effects on physical-chemical soil properties and vegetation composition along transects; and (3) propose conservation measures to stop further damage. Changes were reconstructed from historical multispectral aerial photography (1986 to 1997), measured by GPS device (1997, 2004), and accompanied by detailed soil (1998, 2000 and 2001) and vegetation (2000 and 2004) surveys along transects. Along alkaline roads, fast and profound shifts in physical-chemical soil properties (pH increased from 3.9 up to 7.6, base saturation from 9-30% up to 100%), and species composition were recorded. The roadside vegetation doubled in area during the studied decade. Stress-tolerant tundra species were replaced by meso- to nitrophilous species and species preferring man-made habitats. The intensity of changes depended significantly on the type of road material and the position relative to the road (slope position, distance from the road). Our findings support the assumption that alkaline gravel is the main cause of changes along roads in the area, and indicate the leading role of water transport in the soil and consequent vegetation alteration. To prevent the further damage we recommended replacement of alkaline gravel by granite, even though expensive and technically complicated. Based on our recommendations, the National Park authorities started to reconstruct the trails, although recovery is expected to be slow. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Widespread alteration of flow regimes requires guidelines for the protection of river ecosystems based on sound science. Preservation of the biodiversity within river ecosystems and sustaining natural ecological functions are key aspects of their management. However, the relationship between the biota and flow-related phenomena is poorly understood and, as a consequence, over-simplistic hydrology-based guidelines for river management have been adopted without establishing clear indicators of success. In the present paper, we aim to support the improvement of guidelines for flow (current velocity) management by developing a flow sensitivity index based on macroinvertebrates for Canadian rivers. Using benthic macroinvertebrate (BMI) samples collected by the Canadian Aquatic Biomonitoring Network (CABIN), current velocity preferences for the 55 most common invertebrate taxa across a range of reference and potential reference sites were derived. A Canadian Ecological Flow Index (CEFI) was developed based on these preferences. By testing the index against independent data, CEFI was found to respond mainly to changes in hydraulic conditions, and was minimally influenced by confounding factors (e. g. stream type, organic enrichment). The index was further validated using two independent data sets from the west and east of Canada, suggesting countrywide applicability of the method. In conclusion, we have developed a practical approach to evaluate relationships between hydrological regime and an important component of the river biota, permitting the development of an index which has good potential as an indicator for the effects of flow alteration. Moreover, we outline how the CEFI could be used as a tool for the development of holistic guidelines for the estimation of riverine flow needs.

AB Background: Model violations constitute the major limitation in inferring accurate phylogenies. Characterizing properties of the data that are not being correctly handled by current models is therefore of prime importance. One of the properties of protein evolution is the variation of the relative rate of substitutions across sites and over time, the latter is the phenomenon called heterotachy. Its effect on phylogenetic inference has recently obtained considerable attention, which led to the development of new models of sequence evolution. However, thus far focus has been on the quantitative heterogeneity of the evolutionary process, thereby overlooking more qualitative variations.
   Results: We studied the importance of variation of the site-specific amino-acid substitution process over time and its possible impact on phylogenetic inference. We used the CAT model to define an infinite mixture of substitution processes characterized by equilibrium frequencies over the twenty amino acids, a useful proxy for qualitatively estimating the evolutionary process. Using two large datasets, we show that qualitative changes in site-specific substitution properties over time occurred significantly. To test whether this unaccounted qualitative variation can lead to an erroneous phylogenetic tree, we analyzed a concatenation of mitochondrial proteins in which Cnidaria and Porifera were erroneously grouped. The progressive removal of the sites with the most heterogeneous CAT profiles across clades led to the recovery of the monophyly of Eumetazoa (Cnidaria+Bilateria), suggesting that this heterogeneity can negatively influence phylogenetic inference.
   Conclusion: The time-heterogeneity of the amino-acid replacement process is therefore an important evolutionary aspect that should be incorporated in future models of sequence change.

AB The house sparrow Passer domesticus has been declining in abundance in many localities, including Finland. We studied the genetic diversity and differentiation of the house sparrow populations across Finland in the 1980s, at the onset of the species' decline in abundance. We genotyped 472 adult males (the less dispersive sex) from 13 locations in Finland (covering a range of 400 x 800 km) and one in Sweden (Stockholm) for 13 polymorphic microsatellite markers. Our analysis of Finnish ringing records showed that natal dispersal distances are limited (90% <16 km), which confirmed earlier finding from other countries. The Finnish populations were panmictic, and genetically very homogeneous and the limited dispersal was sufficiently large to maintain their connectivity. However, all Finnish populations differed significantly from the Stockholm population, even though direct geographical distance to it was often smaller than among Finnish populations. Hence, the open sea between Finland and Sweden appears to form a dispersal barrier for this species, whereas dispersal is much less constrained across the Finnish mainland (which lacks geographical barriers). Our findings provide a benchmark for conservation biologists and emphasize the influence of landscape structure on gene flow.

AB Background: Combined metagenomic and metatranscriptomic datasets make it possible to study the molecular evolution of diverse microbial species recovered from their native habitats. The link between gene expression level and sequence conservation was examined using shotgun pyrosequencing of microbial community DNA and RNA from diverse marine environments, and from forest soil.
   Results: Across all samples, expressed genes with transcripts in the RNA sample were significantly more conserved than non-expressed gene sets relative to best matches in reference databases. This discrepancy, observed for many diverse individual genomes and across entire communities, coincided with a shift in amino acid usage between these gene fractions. Expressed genes trended toward GC-enriched amino acids, consistent with a hypothesis of higher levels of functional constraint in this gene pool. Highly expressed genes were significantly more likely to fall within an orthologous gene set shared between closely related taxa (core genes). However, non-core genes, when expressed above the level of detection, were, on average, significantly more highly expressed than core genes based on transcript abundance normalized to gene abundance. Finally, expressed genes showed broad similarities in function across samples, being relatively enriched in genes of energy metabolism and underrepresented by genes of cell growth.
   Conclusions: These patterns support the hypothesis, predicated on studies of model organisms, that gene expression level is a primary correlate of evolutionary rate across diverse microbial taxa from natural environments. Despite their complexity, meta-omic datasets can reveal broad evolutionary patterns across taxonomically, functionally, and environmentally diverse communities.

AB The influence of short- and long-term (cohort) effects of climate and density on the life-histories of ungulates in temperate regions may vary with latitude, habitat, and management practices, but the life-histories of ungulates in the Mediterranean region are less well known. This study examined the short- and long-term effects of rainfall and absolute density on hinds in two of the southernmost populations of red deer (Cervus elaphus hispanicus) in Europe. One population received supplementary forage. Unlike more northerly latitudes, where red deer hinds lose body mass in winter as a result of adverse weather, in the Spanish populations, hinds did not lose body mass. Hinds in the population that received supplementary forage were heavier and more likely to become pregnant than were the hinds in the unsupplemented population. The likelihood of pregnancy occurring was strongly influenced by hind body mass; the proportion of yearlings that became pregnant was consequently lower in the unsupplemented population than in the population that received supplementary forage. Cohort effects on hind body mass (negative for density and positive for rainfall at birth) and on the probability of pregnancy (negative for density at birth) were apparent only in the unsupplemented population, which implies that supplemental feeding may partially compensate for negative density-dependent factors during early growth, and that supplemented deer hinds may experience reduced selection pressures. These results reflect the particular seasonal variation in the abundance and quality of food in Mediterranean habitats. The delayed effects of climate and density at birth on adult hind body mass and the prevalence of pregnancy probably affects population dynamics and constitutes a mechanism by which cohort effects affect the population dynamics in Iberian red deer. The management of Iberian red deer populations should take into account cohort effects and supplemental feeding practices, which can buffer density- and climate-dependent effects and reduce natural selection pressures.

AB Long-term demographic studies have recently shown that global climate change together with increasing direct impacts of human activities, such as fisheries, are affecting the population dynamics of marine top predators. However, the effects of these factors on species distribution and abundance at sea are still poorly understood, particularly in marine ecosystems of the southern hemisphere. Using a unique long-term data set of at-sea observations, we tested for interdecadal (1980s vs. 2000s) changes in summer abundance and distribution of 12 species of Albatrosses and Petrels along a 30 degrees latitudinal gradient between tropical and Antarctic waters of the southern Indian Ocean. There were contrasting effects of climate change on subantarctic seabird distribution and abundance at sea. While subtropical waters showed the highest rate of warming, the species that visited this water mass showed the greatest changes in distribution and abundance. The abundance of Wandering Albatrosses (Diomedea exulans), White-chinned Petrels (Procellaria aequinoctialis) and Giant Petrels (Macronectes sp.) declined markedly, whereas the other species showed contrasting trends or did not change. With the exception of the White-chinned Petrel, these decreases were at least partly related to regional increase in sea surface temperature. The southward shift of Wandering Albatross and Prions (Pachyptila spp.) distributions could be ascribed to species redistribution or decrease in abundance due to warming of the subtropical waters. Surprisingly, White-chinned Petrel distribution shifted northward, suggesting more complex mechanisms. This study is the first to document a shift in species range in the Southern Ocean related to climate change and contrasting abundance changes. It suggests that some species might experience more severe impacts from climate change depending on the water masses they visit. As climate changes are predicted to continue in the next decades, understanding species responses to climate change is crucial for conservation management, especially when their conservation status is critical or unknown.

AB Results of field surveys, stomach content analysis, and laboratory measurements of oxygen consumption at different salinities in the exotic shrimp Palaemon macrodactylus and its native counterpart P. longirostris from the Guadalquivir estuary (SW Spain) were used to assess interaction between both species. After its first record in this estuary in 1998, P. macrodactylus has shown a gradual increase in density and its estuarine population has been clearly dominated by juveniles. Feeding habits of both shrimps indicated a strong trophic overlap between them, with mysids as main prey. Their salinity-related and spatial distribution patterns show that maximal inter-specific overlap between the two populations occurs in the inner, less saline part of the estuary. Specific oxygen consumption rates under different salinities and water oxygen concentrations suggest a more efficient metabolism and a higher tolerance to hypoxic conditions in brackish waters by P. macrodactylus than by P. longirostris. Such inter-specific physiological differences could have made it possible for the exotic P. macrodactylus to invade an estuarine stretch that, prior to its arrival, was infra-utilized by native species.

AB Synthetic science promises an unparalleled ability to find new meaning in old data, extant results, or previously unconnected methods and concepts, but pursuing synthesis can be a difficult and risky endeavor. Our experience as biologists, informaticians, and educators at the National Evolutionary Synthesis Center has affirmed that synthesis can yield major insights, but also revealed that technological hurdles, prevailing academic culture, and general confusion about the nature of synthesis can hamper its progress. By presenting our view of what synthesis is, why it will continue to drive progress in evolutionary biology, and how to remove barriers to its progress, we provide a map to a future in which all scientists can engage productively in synthetic research.

AB Leptobrachium ailaonicum is a vulnerable anuran restricted to a patchy distribution associated with small mountain streams surrounded by forested slopes at mid-elevations (approximately 2000-2600 m) in the subtropical Mount Wuliang and Mount Ailao ranges in southwest China (Yunnan Province) and northern Vietnam. Given high habitat specificity and lack of suitable habitat in lower elevations between these ranges, we hypothesized limited gene flow between populations throughout its range. We used two mitochondrial genes to construct a phylogeographic pattern within this species in order to test our hypothesis. We also examined whether this phylogeographic pattern is a response to past geological events and/or climatic oscillations. A total of 1989 base pairs were obtained from 81 individuals of nine populations yielding 51 unique haplotypes. Both Bayesian and maximum parsimony phylogenetic analyses revealed four deeply divergent and reciprocally monophyletic mtDNA lineages that approximately correspond to four geographical regions separated by deep river valleys. These results suggest a long history of allopatric separation by vicariance. The distinct geographic distributions of four major clades and the estimated divergence time suggest spatial and temporal separations that coincide with climatic and paleogeographic changes following the orogeny and uplift of Mount Ailao during the late Miocene to mid Pliocene in southwest China. At the southern distribution, the presence of two sympatric yet differentiated clades in two areas are interpreted as a result of secondary contact between previously allopatric populations during cooler Pleistocene glacial cycles. Analysis of molecular variance indicates that most of the observed genetic variation occurs among the four regions implying long-term interruption of maternal gene flow, suggesting that L ailaonicum may represent more than one distinct species and should at least be separated into four management units corresponding to these four geographic lineages for conservation.

AB Though declines in the growth and condition of Great Lakes lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis) have been largely attributed to food web disruptions caused by invasive dreissenid mussels, a comprehensive evaluation of alternative hypotheses is currently lacking. Using various statistical approaches, we evaluated 69 years of data from the inner basin of South Bay, Lake Huron, considering the role of biological variables (food availability as Diporeia abundance and lake whitefish relative abundance as catch per unit effort, CPUE) versus environmental variables (climate change as growing degree days >5 degrees C and productive habitat capacity as percent epilimnetic volume, EV) on the condition and early growth rates of resident lake whitefish. Consistently, biological variables (Diporeia abundance, CPUE) best explained changes in lake whitefish growth and condition, respectively, in years when Diporeia data were available. In their absence, environmental variables (EV) best explained early growth rates of lake whitefish, whereas CPUE again best explained lake whitefish condition. Our analysis revealed that environmental change contributed significantly but alone was not sufficient to explain declines in lake whitefish growth after dreissenid establishment, whereas biological variables considered here could account for the majority of growth and condition changes observed in this population.

AB Four out of five members of the RBCS multigene family (OsRBCS2OsRBCS5) were highly expressed in leaf blades of rice (Oryza sativa L.) irrespective of plant growth stage, whereas accumulation of all RBCS mRNAs in leaf sheaths, roots and developing spikelets was quite low. A highly positive correlation was observed between total RBCS and RBCL mRNA levels and Rubisco content at their maxima, irrespective of tissue and growth stage. The results indicate that the total RBCS mRNA level may be a primary determinant for maximal Rubisco protein content and that Rubisco gene expression is well coordinated through the whole life of rice.

AB Identifying the factors determining the non-native species richness (NNSR) in a given area is essential for preventing species invasions. The relative importance of human-related and natural factors considered for explaining NNSR might depend upon both the spatial scale (i.e. the extent of the gradients sampled) and the historical context of the area surveyed. Here, using a worldwide database of freshwater fish occurrences, we tested whether the relative influence of human and ecological determinants of non-native fish species establishment at the scale of the biogeographic realm was consistent (i) with that observed worldwide, and (ii) among the different biogeographical realms. The prominent role of human activity in shaping the global (i.e. worldwide) pattern of NNSR cannot be directly extrapolated to the biogeographic realms. Furthermore, the relationships between human and ecological determinants and NNSR vary strikingly across biogeographic realms, revealing a strong context dependency of the determinants of NNSR. In particular, the human-related factors play a predominant role in explaining the establishment of non-native species in economically developed realms, while in the other realms environmental characteristics of the river basins best explained geographical patterns of NNSR. In the face of future biological invasions, considering both the spatial scale and the historical context of the surveyed area is crucial to adopt effective conservation strategies.

AB Understanding the biological significance of Pleistocene glaciations requires knowledge of the nature and extent of habitat refugia during glacial maxima. An opportunity to examine evidence of glacial forest refugia in a maritime, Southern Hemisphere setting is found in New Zealand, where the extent of Pleistocene forests remains controversial. We used the mitochondrial phylogeography of a forest-edge cicada (Kikihia subalpina) to test the hypothesis that populations of this species survived throughout South Island during the Last Glacial Maximum. We also compared mitochondrial DNA phylogeographic patterns with male song patterns that suggest allopatric divergence across Cook Strait. Cytochrome oxidase I and II sequences were analyzed using network analysis, maximum-likelihood phylogenetic estimation, Bayesian dating and Bayesian skyline plots. K. subalpina haplotypes from North Island and South Island form monophyletic clades that are concordant with song patterns. Song divergence corresponds to approximately 2% genetic divergence, and Bayesian dating suggests that the North Island and South Island population-lineages became isolated around 761 000 years bp. Almost all South Island genetic variation is found in the north of the island, consistent with refugia in Marlborough Sounds, central Nelson and northwest Nelson. All central and southern South Island and Stewart Island haplotypes are extremely similar to northern South Island haplotypes, a 'northern richness/southern purity' pattern that mirrors genetic patterns observed in many Northern Hemisphere taxa. Proposed southern South Island forest habitat fragments may have been too small to sustain populations of K. subalpina, and/or they may have harboured ecological communities with no modern-day analogues.

AB Neotropical freshwater fishes have reached an unrivalled diversity, organized into several areas of endemism, yet the underlying processes are still largely unknown. The topographical and ecological characteristics of the Guyanas Region make it an ideal area of endemism in which to investigate the forces that have shaped this great diversity. This region is thought to be inhabited by species descending from Amazonian ancestors, which would have used two documented routes that, however, hardly explain the entrance of species adapted to running waters. Here, we investigate the evolutionary history of Pseudancistrus brevispinis, a catfish endemic to this region and exclusively found in running waters, thus making it an ideal model for investigating colonization routes and dispersal in such habitats. Our analyses, based on mitochondrial and nuclear markers, revealed an unexpected diversity consisting of six monophyletic lineages within P. brevispinis, showing a disjoint distribution pattern. The lineages endemic to Guyanas coastal rivers form a monophyletic group that originated via an ancestral colonization event from the Amazon basin. Evidence given favours a colonization pathway through river capture between an Amazonian tributary and the Upper Maroni River. Population genetic analyses of the most widespread species indicate that subsequent dispersal among Guyanas coastal rivers occurred principally by temporary connections between adjacent rivers during periods of lower sea level, yet instances of dispersal via interbasin river captures are not excluded. During high sea level intervals, the isolated populations would have diverged leading to the observed allopatric species. This evolutionary process is named the sea level fluctuation (SLF) hypothesis of diversification.

AB Despite the prevalence and importance of intermittent streams, few studies have examined their use by crayfishes. We documented persistence in an intermittent stream and use of the hyporheic zone by 2 imperiled crayfishes, Orconectes williamsi and Orconectes meeki meeki, upon stream drying. During 2005 to 2007, we monitored summer flows and crayfish densities in 10 riffles in a Missouri (US) Ozark stream to document stream drying and crayfish persistence. Stream drying variables were riffle wetted area (m(2)) and current velocity (m/s). Crayfish density estimates were obtained with a quadrat sampler. We sampled monthly (May-August 2006) to examine crayfish response to decreased flows, and excavated dry quadrat samples (to 30 cm depth) after surface flows ceased. Over 2 periods during summer 2007, we used baited traps in the stream and a downstream reservoir where the stream terminates to examine whether crayfish migrated from the stream to permanent water in response to drying. Riffles dried significantly by July, few had surface water present by August, and all were rewetted by the following June. Annual June densities of O. williamsi remained stable throughout the study, whereas densities of O. m. meeki were lower in 2007 than 2005. Both species burrowed to the hyporheic zone during drying, and crayfish densities were similar to those estimated in riffles before drying. We found no evidence that either species migrated to permanent water in the reservoir during drying. Use by crayfish of the hyporheic zone during drying and interannual persistence in intermittent streams suggests that hyporheic habitats are important for conservation of these crayfishes. Our study contributes to the increasing body of knowledge that indicates the importance of intermittent streams for conservation of freshwater biodiversity.

AB The loss of wetlands and semi-natural grasslands throughout much of Europe has led to a historic decline of species associated with these habitats. The reinstatement of these habitats, however, requires spatially explicit predictions of the most suitable sites for restoration, to maximize the ecological benefit per unit effort. One species that demonstrates such declines is the white stork Ciconia ciconia, and the restoration of habitat for this flagship species is likely to benefit a suite of other wetland and grassland biota. Storks are also being reintroduced into southern Sweden and elsewhere, and the a priori identification of suitable sites for reintroduction will greatly improve the success of such programmes. Here a simple predictive habitat-use model was developed, where only a small but reliable presence-only dataset was available. The model is based on the extent and relative soil moisture of semi-natural pastures, the extent of wetlands and the extent of hayfields in southern Sweden. Here the model was used to predict the current extent of stork habitat that is suitable for successful breeding, and the extent of habitat that would become suitable with moderate habitat restoration. The habitat model identifies all 10 occupied nesting sites where breeding is currently successful. It also identifies similar to 300 km(2) of habitat that is predicted to be suitable stork habitat, but that is presently unused; these sites were identified as potential areas for stork reintroduction. The model also identifies over 100 areas where moderate habitat restoration is predicted to have a disproportionate effect (relative to the restoration effort) on the area of suitable habitat for storks; these sites were identified as priorities for habitat restoration. By identifying areas for reintroduction and restoration, such habitat suitability models have the potential to maximize the effectiveness of such conservation programmes.

AB Objective: The objective of this study was to map vegetation composition across a 24 000 ha watershed.
   Location: The study was conducted on the western slope of the Sierra Nevada mountain range of California. USA.
   Methods: Automated image segmentation was used to delineate image objects representing vegetation patches of similar physiognomy and structure. Image objects were classified using a decision tree and data sources extracted from individual species distribution models. Landsat spectral data, and life from cover estimates derived from aerial image-based texture variables.
   Results: A total of 12 plant communities were mapped with an overall accuracy of 75% and a kappa-value of 0.69. Species distribution models inputs improved map accuracy by approximately 15% over maps derived solely from image data. Automated mapping of existing vegetation distributions. based solely oil predictive distribution model results. proved to be more accurate than mapping based on Landsat data, and equivalent in accuracy to mapping based oil all image data sources.
   Conclusions: Results highlight the importance of terrain, edaphic, and bioclimatic variables when mapping vegetation communities in complex terrain. Mapping errors stemmed from the lack of spectral discernability between vegetation classes. and the inability to account for the confounding effects of land use history and disturbance within a static distribution modeling framework.

AB Synopsis Crustaceans are a diverse and ancient group of arthropods that have long been studied as interesting model systems in biology, especially for understanding animal evolution and physiology and for environmentally relevant Studies. Like many model systems, advances in DNA-sequencing methodologies have led to a large amount of genomics-related projects. The purpose of this article is to highlight the genome projects and functional genomics (transcriptomics) projects that are currently underway in crustacean biology. Specifically, we have Surveyed the amount of publicly available DNA sequence data (both genomic and EST data) across all crustacean taxa for which a significant number of DNA sequences have been generated. Several ongoing projects are presented including the ecology of invasive species, thermal physiology, ion and water balance, ecology and evolutionary biology, and developmental biology.

   POTENTIAL IMPACTS; STREAM-FISH; PATTERNS
AB 1. Species-discharge relationships (SDR) are aquatic analogues of species-area relationships, and are increasingly used in both basic research and conservation planning. SDR studies are often limited, however, by two shortcomings. First, they do not determine whether reported SDRs, which normally use complete drainage basins as sampling units, are scale dependent. Second, they do not account for the effects of habitat diversity within or among samples.
   2. We addressed both problems by using discrete fish zones as sampling units in a SDR analysis. To do so, we first tested for longitudinal zonation in three rivers in the southeastern U.S.A. In each river, we detected successive 'lower', 'middle', and 'upper' fish zones, which were characterized by distinct fish assemblages with predictable habitat requirements. Because our analyses combined fish data from multiple sources, we also used rarefaction and Monte Carlo simulation to ensure that our zonation results were robust to spurious sampling effects.
   3. Next, we estimated the average discharge within each zone, and plotted these estimates against the respective species richness within each zone (log(10) data). This revealed a significant, linear SDR (r(2) = 0.83; P < 0.01). Notably, this zonal SDR fit the empirical data better than a comparable SDR that did not discriminate among longitudinal zones. We therefore conclude that the southeastern fish SDR is scale dependent, and that accounting for within-basin habitat diversity is an important step in explaining the high diversity of southeastern fishes.
   4. We then discuss how our zonal SDR can be used to improve conservation planning. Specifically, we show how the slope of the SDR can be used to forecast potential extinction rates, and how the zonal data can be used to identify species of greatest concern.

TI Postglacial Colonisation Patterns and the Role of Isolation and
   Expansion in Driving Diversification in a Passerine Bird
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
AB Pleistocene glacial cycles play a major role in diversification and speciation, although the relative importance of isolation and expansion in driving diversification remains debated. We analysed mitochondrial DNA sequence data from 15 great reed warbler (Acrocephalus arundinaceus) populations distributed over the vast Eurasian breeding range of the species, and revealed unexpected postglacial expansion patterns from two glacial refugia. There were 58 different haplotypes forming two major clades, A and B. Clade A dominated in Western Europe with declining frequencies towards Eastern Europe and the Middle East, but showed a surprising increase in frequency in Western and Central Asia. Clade B dominated in the Middle East, with declining frequencies towards north in Central and Eastern Europe and was absent from Western Europe and Central Asia. A parsimonious explanation for these patterns is independent postglacial expansions from two isolated refugia, and mismatch distribution analyses confirmed this suggestion. Gene flow analyses showed that clade A colonised both Europe and Asia from a refugium in Europe, and that clade B expanded much later and colonised parts of Europe from a refugium in the Middle East. Great reed warblers in the eastern parts of the range have slightly paler plumage than western birds (sometimes treated as separate subspecies; A. a. zarudnyi and A. a. arundinaceus, respectively) and our results suggest that the plumage diversification took place during the easterly expansion of clade A. This supports the postglacial expansion hypothesis proposing that postglacial expansions drive diversification in comparatively short time periods. However, there is no indication of any (strong) reproductive isolation between clades and our data show that the refugia populations became separated during the last glaciation. This is in line with the Pleistocene speciation hypothesis invoking that much longer periods of time in isolation are needed for speciation to occur.

AB An accurate understanding of evolutionary relationships is central in biology. For parasitologists, understanding the relationships among eukaryotic organisms allows the prediction of virulence mechanisms, reconstruction of metabolic pathways, identification of potential drug targets, elucidation of parasite-specific cellular processes and understanding of interactions with the host or vector. Here we consider the impact of major recent revisions of eukaryotic systematics and taxonomy on parasitology. The previous, ladder-like model placed some protists as early diverging, with the remaining eukaryotes "progressing" towards a "crown radiation" of animals, plants, Fungi and some additional protistan lineages. This model has been robustly disproven. The new model is based on vastly increased amounts of molecular sequence data, integration with morphological information and the rigorous application of phylogenetic methods to those data. It now divides eukaryotes into six major supergroups; the relationships between those groups and the order of branching remain unknown. This new eukaryotic phylogeny emphasizes that organisms including Giardia, Trypanosoma and Trichomonas are not primitive, but instead highly evolved and specialised for their specific environments. The wealth of newly available comparative genomic data has also allowed the reconstruction of ancient suites of characteristics and mapping of character evolution in diverse parasites. For example, the last common eukaryotic ancestor was apparently complex, suggesting that lineage-specific adaptations and secondary losses have been important in the evolution of protistan parasites. Referring to the best evidence-based models for eukaryotic evolution will allow parasitologists to make more accurate and reliable inferences about pathogens that cause significant morbidity and mortality.

AB Understanding the functional traits that allow invasives to outperform natives is a necessary first step in improving our ability to predict and manage the spread of invaders. In nutrient-limited systems, plant competitive ability is expected to be closely tied to the ability of a plant to exploit nutrient-rich microsites and use these captured nutrients efficiently. The broad objective of this work was to compare the ability of native and invasive perennial forbs to acquire and use nutrients from nutrient-rich microsites. We evaluated morphological and physiological responses among four native and four invasive species exposed to heterogeneous (patch) or homogeneous (control) nutrient distribution. Invasives, on average, allocated more biomass to roots and allocated proportionately more root length to nutrient-rich microsites than did natives. Invasives also had higher leaf N, photosynthetic rates, and photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency than natives, regardless of treatment. While these results suggest multiple traits may contribute to the success of invasive forbs in low-nutrient environments, we also observed large variation in these traits among native forbs. These observations support the idea that functional trait variation in the plant community may be a better predictor of invasion resistance than the functional group composition of the plant community.

AB 1. In many places in Europe, trees are currently far below their theoretical altitudinal limit because of past land use. However, under the current crisis affecting mountain agriculture, trees are likely to recolonize the subalpine belt. Addressing the societal issues associated with such landscape change requires predictive tools to assess vegetation dynamics in relation to management strategies. This study aims to analyse the factors determining tree dynamics at the subalpine ecotone and to evaluate the impact of land-use change on landscape vegetation patterns.
   2. We developed a hierarchical scaling approach and applied it to a European larch (Larix decidua Mill.) colonization in the French Alps. Our landscape case study focused on subalpine south-facing grasslands of Villar d'Arene (France). First, we used a habitat-suitability model to delineate the climatic suitability habitats of larch in the French Alps. Then we used a landscape model (LaMoS) to determine whether larch is able to colonize these grasslands predicted to be climatically suitable, considering land use and local vegetation. The sensitivity of landscape colonization patterns to land-use scenarios (abandonment, delayed mowing or traditional mowing) and biological attributes of larch were analysed with a factorial simulation experiment.
   3. The accuracy of the habitat-suitability model at the French Alps scale allowed for the prediction that the grasslands of Villar d'Arene were highly suitable for larch.
   4. Simulations highlighted the effect of land use on larch establishment at the local but not at the landscape scale. On the other hand, larch attributes such as dispersal capacity, juvenile tolerance to light interaction (competition and facilitation) and its capacity to survive on infertile soil were shown as essential for tree spatial dynamics.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Combining a habitat-suitability model with a spatially and temporally explicit landscape model enhances the capacity to account for environmental factors acting at different overlapping scales. This modelling strategy increases the robustness and accuracy of predictions, a prerequisite for landscape management in a global change context. We conclude that ongoing and future agri-environmental policies have to be quickly adapted to protect biodiversity and ecosystem services provided by subalpine grasslands.

AB In this study, we propose the use of a favourability function to perform Gap Analysis. To exemplify this, we modelled the distribution of terrestrial mammal species in Andalusia (South of Spain) on the basis of their presence/absence on a grid of 10 km x 10 km UTM cells (n = 961). Using logistic regression and 30 variables related with the environment, space and human influence, we obtained probabilities of occurrence for each species in each cell. We computed a crisp favourability index considering the areas as favourable or unfavourable for a species if the probability of occurrence was higher or lower than the species prevalence, respectively. We also used a favourability function and fuzzy logic to level all species to the same threshold of favourability, which allowed to compare and to combine species distributions. Adding up the fuzzy favourability values for each species in each cell we obtained a fuzzy favourability index that we compared with species richness (sum of species in each cell) and with the crisp favourability index. We performed Gap Analysis by overlapping these results with the current reserve network of Andalusia. Gaps were grouped in fewer and bigger zones after applying the favourability indices. Considerations and recommendations for the use of the favourability function to select areas of conservation interest are discussed.

AB Unlike other eukaryotes, malaria parasites in the genus Plasmodium have structurally and functionally different paralogous copies of the cytosolic (cyto-) SSU rRNA (18S rRNA) gene that are expressed at different developmental stages. In P. falciparum, P. vivax, and P. berghei, A-type cyto-SSU rRNA is expressed in asexual stage, while S-type in sporozoite stage. A third type (O-type) has been described in P. vivax. It is expressed only in oocyst stage in the mosquito. Recently, it has been shown that the maintenance of heterogeneous cyto-SSU rRNAs in Plasmodium can be modeled as a birth-and-death process under strong purifying selection [Rooney, A.P., 2004. Mechanisms underlying the evolution and maintenance of functionally heterogeneous 18S rRNA genes in Apicomplexans. Mol. Biol. Evol. 21, 1704-1711]. In this study, we performed detailed phylogenetic analyses of Plasmodium cyto-SSU rRNAs with special emphasis on the evolution of multi-copy genes in simian Plasmodium species. We sequenced paralogous copies of the cyto-SSU rRNA genes from all African simian Plasmodium species, P. gonderi, and Asian simian Plasmodium species, P. fragile, P. coatneyi, P. inui, P. hylobati, P. fieldi, P. simiovale, and P. cynomolgi. Interestingly, all Asian simian Plasmodium species have a single S-type-like gene and several A-type-like genes. Alignment analysis demonstrated for the first time that an approximately 50-residue insertion in the V7 variable region near the stem 43 is shared exclusively by the S-type-like sequences of the Asian simian Plasmodium species and the S- and O-type sequences of P. vivax. We comprehensively analyzed all cyto-SSU rRNA sequences of the genus Plasmodium currently available in the database. Phylogenetic analyses of all publicly available cyto-SSU rRNA sequences for the genus Plasmodium clearly demonstrated that gene duplication events giving rise to A- and S-type-like sequences took place independently at least three times ill the Plasmodium evolution, supporting the hypothesis that these genes evolve according to a birth-and-death model.

AB The Afrotropical leaf-nosed bat Hipposideros caffer has been traditionally regarded as a complex of populations, currently pertaining to two recognized cryptic species, H caffer and H ruber. Extent of distribution and morphological variation of these bats has raised concerns over whether the current perception of the complex reflects true phylogenctic relationships and taxonomic diversity. Our phylogenetic analysis of nucleotide sequences of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene challenged the hypothesis of two cryptic species. Instead of the two reciprocally monophyletic lineages expected, corresponding to the two species, we recovered four distinct lineages with deep internal divergences. Two sister clades within a lineage of bats of H caffer represent respectively the nominotypical form H. c. caffer, restricted to Southern Africa, and H. c. tephrus, inhabiting the Maghreb, West Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. Geographical isolation and deep genetic divergence Suggest Species status of both the forms. Another lineage comprises specimens of both morphotypes from West and East Africa. It probably represents a distinct species but its taxonomic assignation remains obscure. A Central African lineage of H. ruber comprises two sister clades, which become sympatric in Cameroon. Their status has to be clarified with additional evidence, since nuclear gene flow might be taking place. A further divergent lineage with H. ruber morphotype, most probably representing another distinct species, is restricted to West Africa. Although all three genetic forms of H. ruber may correspond to named taxa, their proper taxonomic assignation has to be assessed by comparison with type material.

AB Background: The evolutionary rate at a given homologous position varies across time. When sufficiently pronounced, this phenomenon - called heterotachy - may produce artefactual phylogenetic reconstructions under the commonly used models of sequence evolution. These observations have motivated the development of models that explicitly recognize heterotachy, with research directions proposed along two main axes: 1) the covarion approach, where sites switch from variable to invariable states; and 2) the mixture of branch lengths (MBL) approach, where alignment patterns are assumed to arise from one of several sets of branch lengths, under a given phylogeny.
   Results: Here, we report the first statistical comparisons contrasting the performance of covarion and MBL modeling strategies. Using simulations under heterotachous conditions, we explore the properties of three model comparison methods: the Akaike information criterion, the Bayesian information criterion, and cross validation. Although more time consuming, cross validation appears more reliable than AIC and BIC as it directly measures the predictive power of a model on 'future' data. We also analyze three large datasets ( nuclear proteins of animals, mitochondrial proteins of mammals, and plastid proteins of plants), and find the optimal number of components of the MBL model to be two for all datasets, indicating that this model is preferred over the standard homogeneous model. However, the covarion model is always favored over the optimal MBL model.
   Conclusion: We demonstrated, using three large datasets, that the covarion model is more efficient at handling heterotachy than the MBL model. This is probably due to the fact that the MBL model requires a serious increase in the number of parameters, as compared to two supplementary parameters of the covarion approach. Further improvements of the both the mixture and the covarion approaches might be obtained by modeling heterogeneous behavior both along time and across sites.

AB Background and Aims Lianas are expected to differ from trees in their growth strategies. As a result these two groups of woody species will have different spatial distributions: lianas are more common in high light environments. This study determines the differences in growth patterns, biomass allocation and leaf traits in five closely related liana and tree species of the genus Bauhinia.
   Methods Seedlings of two light-demanding lianas (Bauhinia tenuiflora and B. claviflora), one shade-tolerant liana (B. aurea), and two light-demanding trees (B. purpurea and B. monandra) were grown in a shadehouse at 25 % of full sunlight. A range of physiological, morphological and biomass parameters at the leaf and whole plant level were compared among these five species.
   Key Results The two light-demanding liana species had higher relative growth rate (RGR), allocated more biomass to leaf production [higher leaf mass fraction (LMF) and higher leaf area ratio (LAR)] and stem mass fraction (SMF), and less biomass to the roots [root mass fraction (RMF)] than the two tree species. The shade-tolerant liana had the lowest RGR of all five species, and had a higher RMF, lower SMF and similar LMF than the two light-demanding liana species. The two light-demanding lianas had lower photosynthetic rates per unit area (A(area)) and similar photosynthetic rates per unit mass (A(mass)) than the trees. Across species, RGR was positively related to SLA, but not to LAR and A(area).
   Conclusions It is concluded that the faster growth of light-demanding lianas compared with light-demanding trees is based on morphological parameters (SLA, LMF and LAR), and cannot be attributed to higher photosynthetic rates at the leaf level. The shade-tolerant liana exhibited a slow-growth strategy, compared with the light-demanding species.

AB Saline inland waters are globally threatened habitats harbouring many specialised endemic species, which often have restricted geographic ranges, and occur as highly isolated populations. We studied the genetic variation and phylogeography of Ochthebius glaber Montes and Soler, a rare and endangered water beetle endemic to hypersaline streams in the South and Southeast of the Iberian Peninsula. We used a 633 bp fragment of cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 gene to determine the genetic diversity and phylogeographic structure within this species, and interpret this in the light of the species' conservation requirements. Thirteen populations were sampled across the species' geographic range, and genetic diversity found to be very high, with 37 haplotypes across the 71 specimens examined (p-distance 0.2-7.3%, average 3.1 +/- 0.4). Phylogeographic analyses revealed a surprisingly high degree of geographical structure, detectable among populations separated by relatively short geographical distances, with three main groups of haplotypes which have apparently been isolated for significant periods of time. Past fragmentation and contiguous range expansion events were inferred as the main causes of the detected geographical associations of haplotypes. The establishment of independent evolutionary lineages as conservation units is particularly important for species inhabiting saline habitats such as O. glaber, which is endangered by habitat loss across most of its distribution. However, given the natural instability of hypersaline environments, the conservation of a network of populations and potential habitats would be necessary to enable the preservation of the process generating and maintaining the diversity of the species.

AB The genetic structure of mangrove species is greatly affected by their geographic history. Nine natural populations of Ceriops tagal were collected from Borneo, the Malay Peninsula, and India for this phylogeographic study. Completely different haplotype compositions on the east versus west coasts of the Malay Peninsula were revealed using the atpB-rbcL and trnL-trnF spacers of chloroplast DNA. The average haplotype diversity (Hd) of the total population was 0.549, nucleotide diversity (theta) was 0.030, and nucleotide difference (pi) was 0.0074. The cladogram constructed by the index of population differentiation (G (ST)) clearly separated the South China Sea populations from the Indian Ocean populations. In the analysis of the minimum spanning network, the Indian Ocean haplotypes were all derived from South China Sea haplotypes, suggesting a dispersal route of C. tagal from Southeast Asia to South Asia. The Sunda Land river system and surface currents might be accountable for the gene flow directions in the South China Sea and Bay of Bengal, respectively. The historical geography not only affected the present genotype distribution but also the evolution of C. tagal. These processes result in the genetic differentiation and the differentiated populations that should be considered as Management Units (MUs) for conservation measurements instead of random forestation, which might lead to gene mixing and reduction of genetic variability of mangrove species. According to this phylogeographic study, populations in Borneo, and east and west Malay Peninsula that have unique genotypes should be considered as distinct MUs, and any activities resulting in gene mixing with each other ought to be prevented.

AB Traditional cultures in and landscapes of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico developed irrigation systems to irrigate floodplain valleys along streams and rivers. Many of these traditional irrigation systems, refereed to as acequias, continue to be used today. Population growth in the region is creating pressures to convert agricultural land and irrigation water to urban and other uses. Unique hydrologic features of the acequia systems suggest that, beyond providing crop irrigation, they may provide additional valuable hydrologic, riparian, and agroecosystern functions worth maintaining. We investi gated in detail the seepage and the groundwater response to seepage from a traditional acequia irrigation ditch along the Rio Grande in north-central New Mexico. We found that 16% of ditch flow seeps into the ditch bed and banks. Groundwater levels near the ditch and midway between the ditch and the river rise I in or more within three to four weeks following the start of the irrigation season. The elevated groundwater table produced by ditch and field seepage is sustained until late Summer when groundwater levels again drop. The seepage that provides this annual groundwater recharge also sustains riparian vegetation along the main ditch and side ditches. In light of our hydrologic analysis, we considered seepage- supported riparian areas and their ecological functions including aquatic habitat, terrestrial habitat, and water quality effects. Acequia hydrology plays an important role in contributing to an ecologically healthy, agriculturally productive, and community-sustaining floodplain agroccosystem.

AB Projected responses of species' to climate change have so far included few of the factors that are important determinants of species' distributions within its range. In this paper we utilise a spatially explicit cellular lattice, colonisation-extinction model to investigate the effect of habitat loss, fragmentation and species characteristics on range shifting in response to climate change. Contrary to the predictions of patch occupancy in static climate models we show that fragmentation can have a positive effect on species survival when species have high colonisation rates. For species with low colonisation rates aggregative behaviours prevent success on fragmented landscapes at high levels of habitat loss, and range shifting is more successfully achieved where habitat is correlated. At levels of habitat loss near the extinction threshold, less fragmented landscapes can facilitate range shifting even for the best colonisers. We discuss how imposing a climate window may reduce percolation routes and have implications for the area of usable habitat at any given level of habitat availability. We demonstrate the importance of landscape structure for range shifting dynamics and argue that management of reserve networks needs to consider the requirements of species with different life history characteristics.

AB 1. Leaf-cutting ants (LCA) are highly polyphagous but at the same time highly selective dominant herbivores of neotropical rainforests. While a whole range of leaf properties has been identified to influence interspecific host choice, the mechanisms underlying intraspecific and intra-individual herbivory patterns remain obscure. Here, we evaluate the plant-stress hypothesis by analysing whether and how drought stress of food plants positively affects LCA food plant selection.
   2. In bioassays with whole plants of Pi)er marginatum, Atta colombica workers harvested more than twice the leaf area of stressed than of vigorous control plants. Within individual plants, the attractiveness of a given leaf increased with its stress level.
   3. Drought stress induced an accumulation of proline and non-structural carbohydrates in the plant tissue by a factor of 3-5 and 2, respectively, accompanied by a decrease in the leaf water content of about 35%). Moreover, samples taken from preferred leaves within a plant contained more osmolytes than those representing the whole plant.
   4. Ants were shown to detect and prefer these osmolytes in bioassays conducted with leaf discs that had been experimentally enriched with proline and/or Sucrose. We therefore propose a mechanism that links the preference of LCA to drought stress via the osmolyte concentrations within the leaves.
   5. Our results support the plant-stress hypothesis, confirming that stressed plants and plant parts are more attractive to LCA. This may account for intraspecific and intra-individual herbivory patterns of LCA, thus influencing populations of host species through the discrimination of drought-sensitive individuals.

AB Based on microhistological analyses of faecal material, we compared the early dry season diets of greater one-horned rhinoceros Rhinoceros unicornis, swamp deer Cervus duvauceli and hog deer Axis porcinus, which inhabit the same alluvial grassland habitat complex in lowland Nepal. Their diets were quite similar, both at the forage category level and within subcategories of graminoids and woody plants. Early successional tall grasses, especially Saccharum spontaneum, were the dominant food of all three species, underlining the key role of the threatened alluvial floodplains in large mammal conservation in South Asia. The two deer species ate significantly more graminoids (> 66.5%) than did rhino (45.5%), and although they did not differ in proportions of graminoids, swamp deer ate significantly more late successional tall grasses (Narenga porphyrocoma and Themeda spp.) and short grasses (mainly Imperata cylindrica) than hog deer. The two deer consumed almost equal proportions of woody browse (ca. 10%), significantly less than that of rhino (33.0%). The prediction of the Jarman-Bell hypothesis, that large-bodied herbivores are less selective and subsist on lower quality graminoids than smaller ruminants, was not supported by the data. Based on this and previous studies in the same area we propose a conceptual model where the larger megaherbivores (rhino and elephant Elephas maximus) facilitate the smaller swamp deer and hog deer during the monsoonal growing season, while the smaller and more selective deer species outcompete the larger during the dry season when food is more limited. Owing to the all-year sprouting ability of S. spontaneum, facilitation may occur also in the dry season with low numbers of megaherbivores, thus accentuating competitive exclusion at higher deer densities.

AB 1. Spatio-temporal variation in resource availability is often large and unpredictable. When animals need to find and sample novel foods, therefore they may prefer to choose food sources with feeding conspecifics or odour left by the conspecifics. This behaviour (local enhancement) would be favoured, especially if it decreases the time spent on food-finding and subsequent decision-making. In laboratory experiments we tested if naive bumble bees use local enhancement, and to what degree it could reduce the time spent on finding and sampling novel flowers.
   2. When naive bees were presented with a pair of equally rewarded artificial or real flowers in a flight cage, they preferred to land and feed on the flower where a dead conspecific was attached. The presence of conspecifics reduced the time spent on detecting floral reward, which was significant only when bees chose between real flowers. In a similar pairwise choice, bees landed on artificial flowers with a dead conspecific wrapped in plastic more frequently than on flowers with the same-sized plastic wrap including no bees, which suggests that visual cues have important influences on the bees' flower choice.
   3. Effects of conspecifics on flower choice and food detection time were most evident when they were attached to real flowers, and least evident when they were wrapped in plastic. These results suggest that the presence of conspecifics on flowers has stronger effects on bees' decision-making as the attractiveness of flowers increases, and that bees use both visual and non-visual cues to recognize conspecifics on flowers.
   4. If the benefit of saving time were universal, the use of local enhancement would also be advantageous when bees switch between focal flower species or sites in response to temporal changes in resource availability.

AB Leaf lifespan in response to resource availability has been documented in many studies, but it still remains uncertain what determines the timing of leaf shedding. Here, we evaluate the lifetime carbon (C) balance of a leaf in a canopy as influenced by nitrogen (N) availability.
   Stands of Xanthium canadense were established with high-nitrogen (HN) and low-nitrogen (LN) treatments and temporal changes of C gain of individual leaves were investigated with a canopy photosynthesis model.
   Daily C gain of a leaf was maximal early in its development and subsequently declined. Daily C gain at shedding was nearly zero in HN, while it was still positive in LN. Sensitivity analyses showed that the decline in the daily C gain resulted primarily from the reduction in light level in HN and by the reduction in leaf N in LN. Smaller leaf size in LN than in HN led to higher light levels in the canopy, which helped leaves of the LN stand maintain for a longer period.
   These results suggest that the mechanism by which leaf lifespan is determined changes depending on the availability of the resource that is most limiting to plant growth.

AB Aim Cryptoblepharus is a genus of small arboreal or rock-dwelling scincid lizards, widespread through the Indo-Pacific and Australian regions, with a disjunct outlier in the Malagasy region. The taxonomy within this genus is controversial, with different authors ranking the different forms (now some 36) at various levels, from different species to subspecies of a single species, Cryptoblepharus boutonii. We investigated the biogeography and genetic differentiation of the Cryptoblepharus from the Western Indian Ocean region, in order to understand their origin and history.

   Methods We analysed sequences of mitochondrial DNA (partial 12s and 16s rRNA genes, 766 bp) from 48 specimens collected in Madagascar, Mauritius, the four Comoros islands and East Africa, and also in New Caledonia, representing the Australo-Pacific unit of the distribution.
   Result Pairwise sequence divergences of c. 3.1% were found between the New Caledonian forms and the ones from the Western Indian Ocean. Two clades were identified in Madagascar, probably corresponding to the recognized forms cognatus and voeltzkowi, and two clades were identified in the Comoro islands, where each island population formed a distinct haplotype clade. The East African samples form a monophyletic unit, with some variation existing between Pemba, Zanzibar and continental Tanzania populations. Individuals from Mauritius form a divergent group, more related to populations from Moheli and Grand Comore (Comoros islands) than to the others.
   Main conclusions The level of divergence between the populations from the Western Indian Ocean and Australian regions and the geographic coherence of the variation within the Western Indian Ocean group are concordant with the hypothesis of a colonization of this region by a natural transoceanic dispersal (from Australia or Indonesia). The group then may have diversified in Madagascar, from where it separately colonized the East African coast, the Comoros islands (twice), and Mauritius. The genetic divergence found is congruent with the known morphological variation, but its degree is much lower than typically seen between distinct species of reptiles.

AB Extreme hydrologic disturbance, such as a supraseasonal drought, can dramatically influence aquatic communities. Documentation of the responses of aquatic communities after such disturbances provides insight into the timing, order, and mechanisms of recolonization. Postdisturbance recolonization of streams depends on many factors, including the region and characteristics of the disturbance relative to the disturbance regime. A supraseasonal drought that ended in the fall of 2000 resulted in the desiccation of numerous small streams or stream segments in northern Mississippi that were normally perennial. We repeatedly sampled fish and crayfish during predrought and postdrought periods in seven stream reaches that dried and five that remained flowing during the drought. From immediately after the drought until early summer of 2001, postdrought fish and crayfish assemblages differed from predrought assemblages in dry sites but not in flowing sites. The initially slow recolonization rates increased considerably during early spring 2001 so that by June 2001 fish catch per unit effort, species composition, and species richness in dry sites no longer differed significantly from predrought values. The fish recolonization process was highly ordered, as indicated by significant patterns of species nestedness over time in dry sites. Crayfish numerical recovery followed a pattern similar to that for fish, and we captured more crayfish in June 2001 than in the predrought period. Patterns in fish and crayfish population size structures over time indicated that repopulation was due to both immigration and reproduction. Recolonization was indicative of high mobility, particularly during spring and early summer. Although the fauna was quite resilient to stream desiccation, the effects on fish species composition and fish and crayfish size structure persisted 1 year after the drought.

AB To elucidate a mechanistic basis for the reductions in chlorophyll (Chl) and inhibition of CO2 assimilation (A(CO2)) in nitrogen (N) starved citrus leaves, changes in Chl concentration and net gas exchange rates were examined together with chloroplast ultrastructure in N-deficient (125 mmol N m(-2)) and N-sufficient (286 mmol N m(-2)) citrus leaves. Two-year-old 'Hamlin' orange (Citrus sinensis L.) trees were field-grown with and without N. N-deficient leaves exhibited smaller chloroplasts (3.30 mu m in length) with reduced Chl concentration per unit area (0.06 mmol N m(-2)), but a greater Chl a/b ratio (3.7) than the N-sufficient leaves. The reductions in Chl and A(CO2) of N-deficient leaves paralleled with high intercellular CO2 concentration (Ci; 259 ppm) in the mesophyll and prodigious accumulation of starch granules (2.71 mu m(2)) in the chloroplasts. Starch granules significantly reduced stroma size and caused disassembly and disruption of the internal membrane system, the grana and stroma lamellae. Concomitant with destruction of membrane assembly was the presence of numerous large plastoglobuli (15 in number). In contrast, A(CO2) increased and Ci declined in N-sufficient leaves. Furthermore, chloroplasts from N-sufficient leaves had well-developed grana and stroma lamellae in parallel alignment with a few small or no starch granules in the large stroma. Thus, it appeared that the loss of chloroplast ultrastructural integrity brought about by starch accumulation facilitated reductions in Chl concentration and CO2 assimilation in N-deficient citrus leaves.

AB (.)Altered environmental conditions may change populations of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and thereby affect mycorrhizal functioning. We investigated whether 8 yr of free-air CO2 enrichment has selected fungi that differently influence the nutrition and growth of host plants.
   In-. a controlled pot experiment, two sets of seven randomly picked single spore isolates, originating from field plots of elevated (60 Pa) or ambient CO2 partial pressure (pCO(2)), were inoculated on nodulated Trifolium repens (white clover) plants. Fungal isolates belonged to the Glomus claroideum or Glomus intraradices species complex, and host plants were clonal micropropagates derived from nine genets.
   (.)Total nitrogen (N) concentration was increased in leaves of plants inoculated with fungal isolates from elevated-pCO(2) plots. These isolates took up nearly twice as much N from the soil as isolates from ambient-pCO(2) plots and showed much greater stimulation of biological N-2 fixation. The morpho-species identity of isolates had a more pronounced effect on N-2 fixation and on root length colonized than isolate identity.
   (.)We conclude that rising atmospheric pCO(2) may select for fungal strains that will help their host plants to meet increased N demands. (c) New Phytologist (2005).

AB The Asiatic wild dog or dhole was once very widely distributed across Asia but now has a very fragmented range. In this first genetic study of this little-known species, we obtained information on genetic diversity, phylogeography, and social structure using both mitochondrial control region sequencing and microsatellite genotyping of noninvasive faecal samples from wild populations, as well as from museum and captive samples. A pattern largely consistent with isolation by distance across the Asian mainland was observed, with no clear subspecies distinctions. However, two major phylogeographical groupings were found across the mainland, one extending from South, Central, and North India (south of the Ganges) into Myanmar, and the other extending from India north of the Ganges into northeastern India, Myanmar, Thailand and the Malaysian Peninsula. We propose a scenario involving glaciation events that could explain this pattern. The origin of the dhole populations in Sumatra and Java is enigmatic and requires further study. Very low levels of genetic diversity were observed among wild dholes from Baluran National Park in Java, Indonesia, but in contrast, high levels were observed in Mudumalai Wildlife Sanctuary in South India.

AB Fossils are widely used as calibration points in molecular-based dating studies, but their placement on a phylogenctic tree of extant species is always highly problematic. We explore some of the problems linked to calibration with fossils, in particular their position on the tree, and emphasize the use Of Multiple calibration points to obtain better estimates. We use a phylogenetic analysis of Betulaceae based on nuclear ribosomal DNA sequences (5S spacer and ITS) as a case study and estimated divergence times within the family using the nonparametric rate smoothing method of Sanderson and five calibration points from the extensive fossil record of this family. To assess the effects of assumptions relating to the positions of key fossils with respect to stem lineages versus crown groups, we calculated age estimates by placing each fossil subsequently on the stem lineage node and crown group node, and then determined the median value of the resulting ten estimates for each node. Using maximum likelihood and DELTRAN and ACCTRAN parsimony branch lengths, we found that the age of the crown group and stem lineage of Betulaceae vary from 115.2 to 130.6 million years and 211.2 to 302.6 million years (Aptian or before). These results are older than current paleobotanical data. We calculated paleobotanical confidence intervals using methods based on the occurrence of fossils on a stratigraphic column and the lengths of the gaps between these occurrences. We apply these methods to the fossil record of Alnus and related extinct genera; however, only in some cases were molecular- and fossil-based age estimates reconciled.

AB Parergodrilidae and Hrabeiella periglandulata are Annelida showing different combinations of clitellate-like and aclitellate characters. Similarities between both of these taxa and Clitellata have widely been regarded as the result of convergent evolution due to similar selection pressures. The position of the three taxa in the phylogenetic system of Annelida is still in debate. However, in analyses based on 18S rDNA sequences a close relationship of Parergodrilidae with Orbimidae and Questidae was suggested. To infer their phylogeny the sequences of the 28S rDNA and of the cytochrome oxidase I (COI) gene of Stygocapitella subterranea, Parergodrilus heideri and H. periglandulata were determined. The data were extended by sequences of various species including species from Clitellata and Orbiniidae. Prior to tree reconstruction the dataset was analysed in detail for phylogenetic content by applying a sliding window analysis, a likelihood mapping and Modeltest V.3.04. Subsequently, generalized parsimony and maximum likelihood methods were employed. Clade robustness was estimated by bootstrapping. In addition, combined analyses of the sequences of 18S rDNA and 28S rDNA as well as of 18S rDNA, 28S rDNA and COI were performed. The combination of the data of the two structure genes and a mitochondrial gene improved the resolution obtained with the single datasets slightly. These analyses support a close relationship of Parergodrilidae and Orbimidae but cannot resolve the position of H. periglandulata. In every analysis Clitellata cluster within 'Polychaeta', confirming previous investigations.

AB This paper summarizes the results of a women's community-based marine protected area that has been successful in sustaining invertebrate biological resources and in prompting strong community support. We outline the project and the associated biological results, describe the processes involved in attaining a committed level of community participation, and review the lessons learned during the project's implementation. We attribute the project's preliminary success-improved shellfish biomass, enhanced local environmental awareness, and the reinvigoration of cultural management practices-to the following factors: 1) the high level of participatory involvement and community leadership; 2) the local perception that shell beds have recovered rapidly and the role that scientific evaluation has played in reinforcing this notion; 3) a research program that is cross-fertilizing indigenous and scientific ecological knowledge; 4) the unique marine tenure system that allows for the project's development and the area's policing; and 5) the tangible economic incentives created by the development project, which ultimately empowers local women. We hope that the project's findings can be generalized to other regions of the world with operational sea-tenure regimes and that it can help to make the establishing of community-based marine protected areas (CBMPAs) across the Pacific region more effective.

AB Phosphorus acquisition efficiency of maize (Zea mays L.) and groundnut (Arachis hypogaea L.) was investigated in a flowing nutrient solution culture at constant P concentrations of 0.2, 1 and 100 muM. To calculate the P influx and study changes in plant growth and P uptake in relation to plant age, four harvests were taken. Phosphor-us uptake kinetics of the roots, i.e. maximum influx, I-max, the Michaelis constant, K-m, and the minimum concentration, C-Lmin (the concentration at which no net uptake occurs) were estimated in a series of short-term experiments, based on the rate of depletion of P from solution over a range of concentrations. At 1 muM P, maize was more P efficient producing up to 90% of its maximum yield as compared to groundnut with only 20% of maximum yield. A 3 times faster P uptake rate was the reason for the maize P efficiency. In contrast for groundnut at 1 muM P, a net efflux was observed at some development stages of this crop indicating a much higher P requirement at the root surface for maximum growth. Maize had a 6 times higher I-max value and a 2 times higher K-m value as compared to groundnut. The higher influx of maize was mainly because of the higher I-max. Maize previously grown at low P concentrations had a C-Lmin of 0.1 muM, while groundnut had values of 0.2 and 0.6 muM. Furthermore groundnut previously grown at 100 muM, was not able to absorb P even at 40 muM. Acclimation to low P concentrations in solution by increasing I-max or decreasing K-m was not evident in this study. Differences in P acquisition efficiency between maize and groundnut in solution culture were mainly because of differences in P-uptake kinetics, and to a lesser extent to the size of the root system.

AB A total of 678 small mammals representing eight species were trapped in western Siberia in 1999-2000 and assayed for the presence of hantaviruses. Eighteen animals, all Clethrionomys species, were antigen positive by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Small and medium genome segments were recovered by RT-PCR from six samples from Clethrionomys glareolus and three from Clethrionomys rufocanus. Sequence comparison and phylogenetic analysis revealed that these hantaviruses were Puumala virus and were similar to hantavirus strains from Finland. To confirm these data, partial nucleotide sequences of the rodent hosts' cytochrome b genes were obtained, as well as several sequences from genes from rodents trapped at different localities of European Russia and western Siberia. The cytochrome b sequences of Siberian bank voles were similar to sequences of C. glareolus, trapped in Finland. These data suggest that the Puumala hantaviruses, as well as their rodent hosts, share a common evolutionary history. We propose that these rodents and viruses may be descendents of a population of bank voles that expanded northward from southern refugia during one of the interglacial periods. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

AB Roads exert a variety of negative effects on wildlife and one of the most severe may be that they form barriers to animal movement. However, the role of roads as barriers has seldom been compared to that of natural barriers. I examined the permeability of roads, rivers, and meadows to songbirds in Banff National Park, Alberta, Canada, where a four-lane highway dissects a wide montane valley. An audio recording of a chickadee (Poecile atricapillus) mobbing call was played to lure birds to travel either parallel or perpendicular to the three barrier types over a range of distances. Relative to parallel trials, forest-dependent birds were reluctant to cross rivers but not roads or meadows, and they crossed barriers less often when the barriers were noisy. Across all gap and barrier combinations, responses declined as trial distance increased, and kinglets were less likely to respond than other families, which included chickadees, nuthatches, warblers, and corvids. The responses of sparrows and thrushes-both forest generalists-showed a weak interaction between barrier type and family, indicating that robins were slightly less likely to respond to trials associated with meadows, and sparrows were less likely to respond in association with rivers. These associations occurred irrespective of gap configuration. Together, these results suggest that the response to barriers by montane birds is strongly dependent on their degree of forest dependence. The surprising result that forest birds were less likely to cross rivers than either roads or meadows may stem from evolutionary history and suggests that birds do not perceive the risk of mortality posed by road traffic.

AB In this experiment, the photosynthetic acclimation of successive needle cohorts of Scots pine were studied during 3 years of growth at elevated CO2 and temperature. Naturally regenerated Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) trees were subjected to elevated CO2 concentration (+CO2, 700 p.p.m), elevated temperature (+T, ambient +2 to +6degreesC) and to a combination of elevated CO2 and temperature (+CO2+T) in closed-top chambers, starting in August 1996. Trees growing in chambers with ambient CO2 and ambient temperature served as controls (AmbC). Elevated CO2 influenced the dark reactions more than the light reactions of photosynthesis, as in the 1996 and 1997 cohorts the carboxylation capacity of Rubisco was reduced in the first and second year of exposure, but there was no consistent change in chlorophyll fluorescence. Net photosynthesis measured at growth concentration of CO2 was higher at +CO2 than at AmbC on only one measuring occasion, was generally lower at +T and was not changed at +CO2 +T. However, trees grown at +T tended to invest more nitrogen (N) in Rubisco, as Rubisco/chlorophyll and the proportion of the total needle N bound to Rubisco occasionally increased. The interaction of +CO2 and +T on Rubisco was mostly negative; consequently; in the second and third year of the experiment the carboxylation capacity decreased at +CO2 +T. In the 1996, 1997 and 1998 cohorts, the structural N concentration of needles was lower at +CO2 than at AmbC. Elevated CO2 and elevated temperature generally had a positive interaction on N concentration; consequently, N concentration in needles decreased less at +CO2+T than at +CO2. At +CO2+T, the acclimation response of needles varied between years and was more pronounced in the 1-year-old needles of the 1997 cohort than in those of the 1998 cohort. Thus, acclimation was not always greater in 1-year-old needles than in current-year needles. In the +CO2+T treatment, elevated temperature had a greater effect on acclimation of needles than elevated CO2.

AB The relative importance of factors such as food, competition, weather, habitat and individual attributes as determinants of fitness in natural populations is difficult to assess. While each component alone can be experimentally manipulated to study its influence on fitness, the relative importance of different factors is very hard to establish experimentally. Here, I describe an attempt to include most major factors simultaneously in an analysis of common buzzard (Buteo buteo) lifespan and lifetime reproductive success (LRS), as two important components of fitness. For both sexes, the most important factor complex determining lifespan and LRS was weather, with high rainfall and cold temperatures reducing fitness. There was no evidence for density-dependent factors influencing buzzard fitness. Habitat variables related to human disturbance were important predictor variables for the dark and light morph but not to the same extend for the intermediate morph. Thus selection pressures resulting from different factors did not vary much between sexes but varied between the three phenotypes in the population.

AB The composition of cuticular hydrocarbons of different colonies of the fungus-growing termite Macrotermes falciger shows considerable intercolonial variation. Ordination, as well as cluster analyses, separate profiles into three distinct chemical phenotypes. Behavioural tests with major workers reveal no alarm behaviour or mortality in pairings of workers from the same colony but a full range from no alarm to overt aggression, with associated death, when individuals were paired from different colonies. The level of mortality increases with differences in the composition of cuticular hydrocarbons between colonies. However, no mortality occurs in pairings of individuals from neighbouring colonies belonging to different phenotypes. The data thus provide evidence for a 'neighbour-stranger' effect (so-called 'dear-enemy' phenomenon) in termites.

AB While researching Cardamine (Brassicaceae) in the Pyrenees, putative hybrid plants were found at two natural sites. Pollen grain viability, AFLP, and multivariate morphometric analyses were performed in order to assess the plants' presumed hybrid origin, establishing that natural hybridization between the diploids C. crassifolia and C. amara ssp. pyrenaea had occurred. A new diploid nothospecies, C. xenriquei (2n = 2x = 16), is described. Examination of 18 morphological characters showed the intermediacy of the hybrid between the parental taxa in most characters. AFLP analyses of C. amara ssp. amara, ssp. austriaca, ssp. olotensis and C. raphanifolia, demonstrated the close position of the hybrid to C. crassifolia, and revealed that the highest number of markers were shared with the parents. Polymorphism found in the AFLP pattern of the hybrid suggested recurrent origin, segregation and/or backcrosses, although, assessment of pollen viability indicated high male sterility. The hybridization event reported here represents the second documented case between the C. pratensis group and C. amara. An account of the nomenclature of C. crassifolia is also presented, including lectotypification of relevant names. (C) 2002 The Linnean Society of London.

AB Biological control systems can evolve; founder effects, drift, inbreeding, and adaptation to new environments can occur during the introduction and establishment of exotic pests and their natural enemies. It has been hypothesized that successful biological control agents are those that become locally adapted to their new environment or populations of hosts. However, there are no explicit comparisons of native and introduced populations of biological control agents testing for local adaptation. The pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum, is an introduced pest of legumes. Aphidius ervi, a parasitoid wasp, was introduced from France to control pea aphids. Using reciprocal transplant experiments, I compared introduced populations of pea aphids and A. ervi from New York State with native populations from France. I documented patterns of aphid resistance to parasitism and A. ervi ability to overcome aphid resistance (virulence) in the two localities and explored whether the introduced parasitoids are locally adapted to the introduced pea aphids. I found that parasitoids from native French populations have high rates of parasitism on pea aphids specialized on clover and on pea aphids specialized on alfalfa, regardless of whether the aphids are collected from France or New York. Introduced parasitoids from New York have high rates of parasitism on pea aphids from clover, but low rates of parasitism on pea aphids from either New York or French alfalfa fields. Thus, there is no evidence that the introduced wasps have become adapted to their local populations of pea aphid hosts. On the contrary, the ability of the introduced parasitoids to develop successfully in pea aphids from alfalfa may have been compromised by the biological control introduction. This apparently nonadaptive evolution was cryptic until examined experimentally. A better understanding of the effects of biological control introductions on natural enemies will come through additional comparisons of native and introduced populations of biocontrol agents. Such comparisons may provide valuable insights into the role of microevolutionary change in biological control and suggest useful avenues to enhance the success of biological control introductions.

AB Weeping pinon (Pinus pinceana) has a restricted and fragmented range, trees are widely scattered within populations, and reproduction is limited. Nevertheless, genetic diversity was high; based on 27 isozyme loci in 18 enzyme systems, unbiased expected heterozygosity averaged 0.174. Differentiation also was high (F-sr = 0.152), reflecting isolation between southern, central, and northern fragments of the range. Among populations in the northern fragment, F-sr was only 0.056, and the number of migrants per generation (Nm) was 4.21, which should preclude fixation. Nm between central and southern populations or between them and populations in the northern fragment was lower, 0.99-1.66, indicating a degree of genetic isolation. Multilocus outcrossing rates (t(m)) ranged from 0.836 in the south to 0.897 in the north. Therefore, selling is low but statistically significant. The equilibrium inbreeding coefficient (F-e) calculated from t(m) was in good agreement with observed inbreeding coefficients, suggesting that weeping pinon may be near equilibrium with respect to inbreeding and selection against selfed trees. Weeping pinon was variable at all loci polymorphic in maxipinon (Pinus maximartinezii) and, therefore, qualities as a possible progenitor of maxipinon. Because of the high level of diversity, reasonable levels of gene flow within the northern fragment of weeping pinon's range, high rates of outcrossing, and, perhaps, only weak selection against inbred trees, protection in reserves would be a viable option for conservation.

   NUMBER
AB Anaecypris hispanica is a cyprinid fish which is endemic to the Guadiana River basin in the Iberian Peninsula, and whose abundance and geographical range have contracted considerably during the last 20 years. We investigated mitochondrial DNA cytochrome b and control region variation among specimens representative of nine tributaries, using direct sequencing and diagnostic restriction fragment length polymorphism. The samples from the Caia, Degebe, Ardila, and Odeleite rivers exhibited haplotypes that differed by a large number of site differences, which may be indicative of population bottlenecks that have caused stochastic extinction of haplotypes. In contrast, the populations from the Xevora, Chanca, Carreiras, Vascao and Foupana rivers exhibited low levels of nucleotide diversity, which together with high haplotype diversity may also be indicative of genetic bottleneck events, with subsequent population expansion. Phylogenetic analyses, a minimum spanning network, and an analysis of molecular variance revealed geographical structuring, suggesting limited or no gene flow between populations. The populations from extreme southern rivers (Foupana and Odeleite) are monophyletic entities, suggesting that they have been isolated, probably as a consequence of brackish water upstream of their confluence with the Guadiana. The results suggest that the Foupana and the Odeleite populations, and the remaining northern populations altogether should be managed as three distinct Evolutionary Significant Units (ESUs). Within the northern ESU, four Management Units (MUs) should be considered.

AB C assimilation (A) has been shown to limit the growth of young Lactuca sativa (lettuce) plants following an interruption in their external N supply. Further data from these plants were used to test two hypotheses: that N-limited growth of lettuce is associated with lower stomatal conductance (g(s)); and that reductions in g(s) result from adjustments to stomatal frequency or distribution.
   The photosynthetic characteristics, nitrate and organic N-concentrations, as well as epidermal and stomatal distributions, were determined in leaves of hydroponically grown lettuce plants supplied continuously with N or with N removed for up to 14 d.
   Although N-limited plants had lower maximum rates of A, comparisons at equivalent values of g(s) showed that A was not directly limited by organic-N but by g(s) Reductions in g(s) under N-limiting conditions did not associate with adjustments to stomatal frequency or distribution.
   Associations between plant N and A could arise either through stomata responding directly to signals induced by N deprivation or to increased CO2 partial pressure at the sites of carboxylation.

AB The genetic differentiation and the phylogenetic status of brown hare (Lepus europaeus) populations from central Greece as well as the impact of the releases of reared individuals on the native populations genetic structure was assessed, using mtDNA RFLP-RCR analysis. Data analysis revealed extensive haplotype diversity (42 out of 56 haplotypes were unique) within and among wild populations, Haplotype diversity was equally distributed within and between geographical regions, while significant genetic structuring was evident from heterogeneity of haplotype frequencies among sampling sites. Specific mtDNA profiles clearly differentiated reared from wild individuals and proved highly indicative for reared hares from past releases caught within wild populations. MtDNA analysis suggests the introgression of allochthonous gene pools into the native populations. To conserve indigenous genotypes and to prevent loss of genetic diversity, restocking operations should be stopped and an appropriate management adjusted to the local population dynamics should be developed.

AB Multiple mating by females is a subject of considerable controversy. In some species, however, females appear to mate only once, and the potential costs and benefits of this behavior are equally intriguing. When male mating success is highly skewed, monandrous females potentially risk mating with a sperm depleted male. In lek-breeding species, a male may gain up to 80 % of available matings, yet few studies have explored whether these highly successful males suffer sperm depletion. These points are investigated in a series of laboratory experiments on the lekking sandfly Lutzomyia longipalpis. It is shown that females may actively reject males prior to and after genital contact and that mated females do not remate within a single egg-laying cycle regardless of the refractory period between the first and subsequent matings. Males mate multiply and suffer from the effects of sperm depletion after their fifth copulation. Despite this, they continue to court and copulate females with equal vigor and females do not appear to detect sperm-depleted males: they lay similar numbers of eggs irrespective of the number of females their mate has previously copulated with. The implications of a single mating for L. longipalpis females in natural and laboratory leks are discussed.

AB There are many methods available for evaluating conservation priorities. Traditional methods of species richness, genus richness and critical species counts were compared with newer methods of phylogenetic and genetic diversity. Conservation priorities for areas designated by the Interim biogeographic regionalisation for Australia (Thackway Br Cresswell, 1995) were assessed on the basis of the freshwater crayfish fauna of Australia. Distributions for all crayfish species were taken from the literature, and plotted in the IBRA areas. Species and genus richness, as well as the number of rare or endangered species were calculated for each area. A phylogeny of 35 representative crayfish based on 16 S rDNA sequence data was used to assess phylogenetic and genetic diversity of species and genera. Methods of species richness and phylogenetic diversity agreed to a large extent in their ranking of areas, both methods agreed that the north-west coast of Tasmania and the south-eastern portion of the continent were of highest priority for conserving the greatest amount of diversity. These results differ greatly from high priority areas based on other taxonomic groups, emphasizing the importance of broad taxonomic and ecological sampling in making conservation decisions.

AB The conservation status of freshwater fish is of concern throughout the world, a third of all known species having become extinct or being endangered. Many of them have fragmented populations of small size whose future is in doubt. Conservation biology is the discipline that is used to study such populations, so that they can be managed in a way that will ensure their long-term survival. The history, development and future of conservation biology are described. Following repeated restocking of brown trout (Salmo trutta) dating from 1906, the marble trout (Salmo marmoratus) seems to have disappeared as a result of genetic pollution (hybridisation) from the lower reaches of the Soca River in Slovenia. A project for rehabilitating the marble trout has been undertaken and will serve as an example to illustrate an application of conservation biology to freshwater fish. A preliminary exploratory stage (1993-1995) that resulted in the publication in 1996 of an Action Plan, written in English and Slovenian, suggested that the cause of the disappearance of the marble trout was hybridisation, established the validity of the project in the region in question and provided us with essential information (occurrence of genetically pure populations) that could be used to define our future strategy. We chose genetic rehabilitation, i.e., the replacement of a population of introduced and introgressed fish by a population of genetically pure fish of the native species, rather than a programme of eradicating undesirable fish by chemical methods, which would have been incompatible with the region's context. Our overall strategy therefore had two main aims: to ensure the long-term survival of populations of pure marble trout (species conservation) and to rehabilitate the genes of marble trout in the hybridisation zone until foreign genes have almost been eliminated.

AB A detailed analysis of the evolutionary history of hepatitis B virus (HBV) was undertaken using 39 mammalian hepadnaviruses for which complete genome sequences were available, including representatives of all six human genotypes, as well as a large sample of small S gene sequences. Phylogenetic trees of these data were ambiguous, supporting no single place of origin for HBV, and depended heavily on the underlying model of DNA substitution. In some instances genotype F, predominant in the Americas, was the first to diverge, suggesting that the virus arose in the New World. In other trees, however, sequences from genotype B, prevalent in East Asia, were the most divergent. An attempt was also made to determine the rate of nucleotide substitution in the C open reading frame and then to elate the origin of HBV. However, no relationship between time and number of substitutions was found in two independent data sets, indicating that a reliable molecular clock does not exist for these data. Both the pattern and the rate of nucleotide substitution are therefore complex phenomena in HBV and hinder any attempt to reconstruct the past spread of this virus.

AB The crowned snake Tantilla melanocephala is a small fossorial sonorine snake, widely distributed through South America. Dissection of 186 specimens, combined with observations of captive specimens, provided information on the natural history of this species in southeastern Brazil. Females attained lager body sizes than males. Apparently T. melanocephala forage at night for active prey. Centipedes of the genus Otostigmus were the main prey item. These centipedes are subdued by injection of venom. Data from preserved specimens showed no significant seasonal variation in the number of collected snakes. Reproduction seemed to be highly seasonal with vitellogenesis occurring from onset to the middle of the rainy season and hatching at the end of the rainy season. Clutch size ranged from one to three and was correlated with female body length. Neonates measured 10-12 cm snout-vent length and juveniles attained about 17.5 cm SVL during the first year. Apparently males attain sexual maturity at an age of about 10 months and females at about 20 months.

AB The incorporation of information on the phenotypic attributes and performance of fish into models of population dynamics may greatly enhance our ability to predict population change. To date, reef-fish research has concentrated on numerical aspects of the recruitment process, with little attention to the quality of recruits. Information reviewed here suggests that the attributes of individual fish, be they related to fish size, performance or condition at the end of the larval phase, may markedly influence the dynamics of the demersal life stages. This review briefly explores the levels of variability in some aspects of fish condition at settlement, the mechanisms by which this variability is enhanced or affected by density-dependent processes, and the ramifications of this phenotypic variability for the persistence of cohorts.

AB Predation on recently settled reef fishes is thought to potentially alter their patterns of recruitment. This paper describes observations of recruitment and mortality of pomacentrid recruits on artificial reefs constructed at two distances from natural reefs with differing numbers of large predatory fish. Subsequent patterns of recruit abundance ( < 3 wks old) on the artificial reefs were not obscured by post-recruitment mortality due to predation. These results motivated an experiment designed to assess whether predation pressure on artificial reefs was representative of predation pressure on natural reefs. The results indicated that prey on artificial reefs were less likely to encounter large predatory fish than prey on natural reefs. Tethered fish disappeared at a greater rate on natural reefs than on artificial reefs, and such losses were minimal within cages that excluded large predatory fish. These findings highlight the potential for predation pressure to vary among different habitat types and a need for care when choosing the habitats in which to study the effects of predation.

AB Although adaptationist hypotheses predict a functional relationship between mating systems and sexual size dimorphism, such predictions are difficult to test because of the high degree of phylogenetic conservatism in both of these traits. Taxa that show intraspecific variation in mating systems hence offer valuable opportunities for more direct tests of evolutionary-ecological hypotheses. Based on a collation of published and unpublished records, we document intraspecific geographic variation in mating systems (presence versus absence of male-male combat) within the widely-distributed Australian python Morelia spilota. Radiotelemetric monitoring of 19 free-ranging pythons in a population in north-eastern New South Wales showed that these animals display a mating system of female defence polygyny. Previous studies on a southern population of the same species found that males engaged in long mate-searching movements, showed no overt agonistic behavior, and formed long-term (>2 months) aggregations around reproductive females. In strong contrast, our adult male carpet pythons (i) moved about relatively little (mean displacement <11 m/day) during the mating season, (ii) remained with females only briefly (<5 days), and (iii) engaged in male-male combat in the vicinity of females. This male-male combat included vigorous biting as well as ritualised ''wrestling'' matches, resulting in a high incidence of bite scars in adult males. In keeping with predictions from sexual selection theory, males attain larger body sizes than females in this population, whereas females grow larger than males in the previously-studied southern population where males do not engage in physical combat for mating opportunities.

AB We studied the water relations of 6 shrub and 3 tree species typical of the mediterranean climate region of central Spain to identify differential responses to water stress between and within species, and to determine if free proline concentration in leaves could be used as a water stress indicator. Predawn and midday water potentials (Psi w) on a seasonal basis, relative water content (RWC), leaf mass per area, foliar nitrogen and free proline concentrations were measured. The lowest water potentials were observed at the end of the summer, with recovery to higher water potentials in the fall and winter seasons. Species differed regarding the annual Psi w fluctuation. Thymus zygis, Halimium viscosum, Genista hirsuta and Juniperus oxycedrus exhibited the most negative midday and predawn Psi w (both less than -6 MPa) with a large magnitude of response to changing conditions in soil moisture of the upper horizon of the soil. Lavandula pedunculata and Cistus ladanifer showed a moderate response. Quercus rotundifolia, Quercus faginea and Retama sphaerocarpa showed a modest response. The Psi w of different size individuals of Quercus rotundifolia and Cistus ladanifer were compared. The annual Psi w fluctuation was greater in small individuals as compared to large individuals. In every species, there was an increase in proline concentration of bulk leaf tissues when predawn Psi w dropped below -5 MPa. Small plants of Cistus ladanifer reached lower water potentials and also higher concentration of proline than bigger plants. Proline could possibly be used as a drought stress indicator in every species except and. rotundifolia. It is suggested that in addition to water stress avoidance due to deep root systems, some mechanisms of water stress tolerance may operate among shrub and tree species of central Spain.

AB Niche relationships and diet overlaps were compared among elk (Cervus elaphus), bison (Bison bison), bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis), mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus), and pronghorn antelope (Antilocapra americana) between 1967-1970 and 1986-1988, a period when total ungulate numbers nearly tripled on Yellowstone's northern range. Ungulate species ratios on Yellowstone's northern winter range during the latter period were 100 elk : 10 mule deer : 3 bison : 2 pronghorns : 1 bighorns. Elk numbers were positively correlated to bison, mule deer, and pronghorn numbers (r(2) = 0.76, 0.97, and 0.48, respectively, P < 0.01). Few other changes in habitat use or habitat overlap occurred, and diets for only 2 of the 10 species pairs, elk-bighorn (Spearman's rank order coefficient (RHO) = 0.55, P < 0.05) and mule deer - pronghorn (RHO = 0.64, P < 0.05), were significantly associated with each other. Bison consumed more grass and fewer sedges, mule deer more fringed sage (Artemisia frigida) and more rabbit-brush (Chrysothamnus spp.), and bighorn sheep more grasses and fewer sedges, while pronghorns ate less saltsage (Atriplex nuttalli) but more big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata) during 1986-1988 than during 1967-1970. Bison expanded their range and bison and bighorn sheep used a wider variety of habitats. We found little evidence of change in competitive interactions between ungulate species. A few diet and habitat overlaps increased, the opposite of the prediction from the competitive exclusion principle amongst species, suggesting that intraspecific competition was more important. Several explanations are proposed for the lack of changes in niche relationships during a period of near tripling in density of the ungulate guild.

AB An experiment was set up to investigate the role of arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) in utilization of P from organic matter during mineralization in soil. Cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) inoculated with one of two AM fungi or left uninoculated were grown for 30 days in cross-shaped PVC pots. One of two horizontal compartments contained 100 g soil (quartz sand : clay loam, 1:1) with 0.5 g ground clover leaves labelled with P-32. The labelled soil received microbial inoculum without AM fungi to ensure mineralization of the added organic matter. The labelling compartment was separated from a central root compartment by either 37 mu m or 700 mu m nylon mesh giving only hyphae or both roots and hyphae, respectively, access to the labelled soil. The recovery of P-32 from the hyphal compartment was 5.5 and 8.6 % for plants colonized with Glomus sp. and G. caledonium, respectively, but only 0.6 % for the non-mycorrhizal controls. Interfungal differences were not related to root colonization or hyphal length densities, which were lowest for G. caledonium. Both fungi depleted the labelled soil of NaHCO3-extractable P and P-32 compared to controls. A 15-25 % recovery of P-32 by roots was not enhanced in the presence of mycorrhizas, probably due to high root densities in the labelled soil. The experiment confirms that AM fungi differ in P uptake characteristics, and that mycorrhizal hyphae can intercept some P immobilization by other microorganisms and P-sorbing clay minerals.

AB The carbon balance and changes in leaf structure in Clusia minor L. were investigated in controlled conditions with regard to nitrogen supply and responses to low and high photosynthetically active radiation (PAR).  Nitrogen deficiency and high PAR led to the production of smaller leaves with higher specific leaf dry weight (SLDW) and higher leaf water content, but with lower chlorophyll content.  Nitrogen and PAR levels at growth also affected CO2 exchange and leaf area.  In - N conditions, total daily net CO2 uptake and leaf area accumulation were slighly less for high-PAR-grown plants.  In contrast, high-PAR-grown plants supplied with nitrogen showed about a 4-fold higher total daily CO2 uptake and about twice the total leaf area of low-PAR-grown plants.  Although total daily net CO2 uptake of + N plants was only slightly higher than - N plants under the low PAR level, + N plants produced almost three times more leaf area but with lower SLDW.
   Under well-wanted conditions, low-PAR-grown plants showed only CO2 evolution during the night and malic acid levels decreased.  However, there was considerable night-time accumulation of titratable protons due to day/night changes in citric acid levels.  High-PAR-grown plants showed net CO2 uptake, malate and citrate accumulation during the dark period.  However, most of the CO2 fixed at night probably came from respiratory CO2.  Positive night-time CO2 exchange was readily observed for low-PAR-grown plants when they were transferred to high PAR conditions or when they were submitted to water stress.  In plants grown in high and low PAR, CAM leads to a substantial increase in daily water use efficiency for water-stressed plants, although total net CO2 uptake decreased.

AB The degree to which wildfire activity in Australia is affected by climate change is not well quantified. Here, the authors show that the frequency of forest fires and the area burned have increased significantly over recent decades, mainly due to an increase in dangerous fire weather conditions through warmer temperature and circulation changes.
   Fire activity in Australia is strongly affected by high inter-annual climate variability and extremes. Through changes in the climate, anthropogenic climate change has the potential to alter fire dynamics. Here we compile satellite (19 and 32 years) and ground-based (90 years) burned area datasets, climate and weather observations, and simulated fuel loads for Australian forests. Burned area in Australia's forests shows a linear positive annual trend but an exponential increase during autumn and winter. The mean number of years since the last fire has decreased consecutively in each of the past four decades, while the frequency of forest megafire years (>1 Mha burned) has markedly increased since 2000. The increase in forest burned area is consistent with increasingly more dangerous fire weather conditions, increased risk factors associated with pyroconvection, including fire-generated thunderstorms, and increased ignitions from dry lightning, all associated to varying degrees with anthropogenic climate change.

AB The objective of this study is to assess the gully head-cut erosion susceptibility and identify gully erosion prone areas in the Meimand watershed, Iran. In recent years, this study area has been greatly influenced by several head-cut gullies due to unusual climatic factors and human induced activity. The present study is therefore intended to address this issue by developing head-cut gully erosion prediction maps using boosting ensemble machine learning algorithms, namely Boosted Tree (BT), Boosted Generalized Linear Models (BGLM), Boosted Regression Tree (BRT), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), and Deep Boost (DB). Initially, we produced a gully erosion inventory map using a variety of resources, including published reports, Google Earth images, and field records of the Global Positioning System (GPS). Subsequently, we distributed this information randomly and choose 70% (102) of the test gullies and the remaining 30% (43) for validation. The methodology was designed using morphometric and thematic determinants, including 14 head-cut gully erosion conditioning features. We have also investigated the following: (a) Multi-collinearity analysis to determine the linearity of the independent variables, (b) Predictive capability of piping models using train and test dataset and (c) Variables importance affecting head-cut gully erosion. The study reveals that altitude, land use, distances from road and soil characteristics influenced the method with the greatest impact on head-cut gully erosion susceptibility. We presented five head-cut gully erosion susceptibility maps and investigated their predictive accuracy through area under curve (AUC). The AUC test reveals that the DB machine learning method demonstrated significantly higher accuracy (AUC = 0.95) than the BT (AUC = 0.93), BGLM (AUC = 0.91), BRT (AUC = 0.94) and XGB (AUC = 0.92) approaches. The predicted head-cut gully erosion susceptibility maps can be used by policy makers and local authorities for soil conservation and to prevent threats to human activities.

AB Global expansion of invasive plant species has caused serious ecological and economic problems. Two such invasive species, ragweed and horseweed, were pyrolyzed at temperatures of 350, 450 and 550 degrees C for biochar production (RB350, RB450, RB550 and HB350, HB450, HB550). The biochars produced were used for Cd(II) and Pb(II) removal in aqueous solutions. The results indicated that the properties of the biochars varied with pyrolysis temperature, which further affected their adsorption performance. The maximum adsorption capacity of RB450 for Cd(II) (139 mg.g(-1)) and Pb(II) (358.7 mg.g(-1)) was much higher than that shown in previous studies. The immobilized Cd(II) and Pb(II) fraction on RB450, RB550, HB450 and HB550 was mainly attributable to the acid soluble and non-available fractions. These findings suggested that pyrolysis of invasive plants at 450 degrees C could not only be an option to control invasive plants but also could be of benefit in using biochar as excellent adsorbent.

AB Microplastics are recognized as an emerging contaminant worldwide. Although microplastics have been shown to strongly affect organisms in aquatic environments, less is known about whether and how microplastics can affect different taxa within a soil community, and it is unclear whether these effects can cascade through soil food webs. By conducting a microplastic manipulation experiment, i.e. adding low-density polyethylene fragments in the field, we found that microplastic addition significantly affected the composition and abundance of microarthropod and nematode communities. Contrary to soil fauna, we found only small effects of microplastics on the biomass and structure of soil microbial communities. Nevertheless, structural equation modelling revealed that the effects of microplastics strongly cascade through the soil food webs, leading to the modification of microbial functioning with further potential consequences on soil carbon and nutrient cycling. Our results highlight that taking into account the effects of microplastics at different trophic levels is important to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the ecological impacts of microplastic pollution on soil functioning.

AB The formulation of 17 sustainable development goals (SDGs) in 2015 was a major leap forward in humankind's quest for a sustainable future, which likely began in the 17th century, when declining forest resources in Europe led to proposals for the re-establishment and conservation of forests, a strategy that embodies the great idea that the current generation bears responsibility for future generations. Global progress toward SDG fulfillment is monitored by 231 unique social-ecological indicators spread across 169 targets, and remote sensing (RS) provides Earth observation data, directly or indirectly, for 30 (18%) of these indicators. Unfortunately, the UN Global Sustainable Development Report 2019-The Future is Now: Science for Achieving Sustainable Development concluded that, despite initial efforts, the world is not yet on track for achieving most of the SDG targets. Through the EO4SDG initiative by the Group on Earth Observations, however, the full potential of RS is now being explored at a global scale. As of April 2020, preliminary statistical data were available for 21 (70%) of the 30 RS-based SDG indicators, according to the Global SDG Indicators Database. Ten (33%) of the RS-based SDG indicators have also been included in the SDG Index and Dashboards found in the Sustainable Development Report 2019-Transformations to Achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. These statistics, however, do not necessarily reflect the actual status and availability of raw and processed geospatial data for the RS-based indicators, which remains an important issue. Nevertheless, various initiatives have been started to address the need for open access data. RS data can also help in the development of other potentially relevant complementary indicators or sub-indicators. By doing so, they can help meet one of the current challenges of SDG monitoring, which is how best to operationalize the SDG indicators.

AB Plants and vegetation play a critical-but largely unpredictable-role in global environmental changes due to the multitude of contributing processes at widely different spatial and temporal scales. In this Perspective, we explore approaches to master this complexity and improve our ability to predict vegetation dynamics by explicitly taking account of principles that constrain plant and ecosystem behaviour: natural selection, self-organization and entropy maximization. These ideas are increasingly being used in vegetation models, but we argue that their full potential has yet to be realized. We demonstrate the power of natural selection-based optimality principles to predict photosynthetic and carbon allocation responses to multiple environmental drivers, as well as how individual plasticity leads to the predictable self-organization of forest canopies. We show how models of natural selection acting on a few key traits can generate realistic plant communities and how entropy maximization can identify the most probable outcomes of community dynamics in space- and time-varying environments. Finally, we present a roadmap indicating how these principles could be combined in a new generation of models with stronger theoretical foundations and an improved capacity to predict complex vegetation responses to environmental change.
   Integrating natural selection and other organizing principles into next-generation vegetation models could render them more theoretically sound and useful for earth system applications and modelling climate impacts.

TI Cleaning up seas using blue growth initiatives: Mussel farming for

AB Eutrophication is a serious threat to aquatic ecosystems globally with pronounced negative effects in the Baltic and other semi-enclosed estuaries and regional seas, where algal growth associated with excess nutrients causes widespread oxygen free "dead zones" and other threats to sustainability. Decades of policy initiatives to reduce external (land-based and atmospheric) nutrient loads have so far failed to control Baltic Sea eutrophication, which is compounded by significant internal release of legacy phosphorus (P) and biological nitrogen (N) fixation. Farming and harvesting of the native mussel species (Mytilus edulis/trossulus) is a promising internal measure for eutrophication control in the brackish Baltic Sea. Mussels from the more saline outer Baltic had higherNand P content than those fromeither the inner or central Baltic. Despite their relatively lownutrient content, harvesting farmed mussels from the central Baltic can be a cost-effective complement to land-based measures needed to reach eutrophication status targets and is an important contributor to circularity. Cost effectiveness of nutrient removal is more dependent on farm type than mussel nutrient content, suggesting the need for additional development of farm technology. Furthermore, current regulations are not sufficiently conducive to implementation of internal measures, and may constitute a bottleneck for reaching eutrophication status targets in the Baltic Sea and elsewhere.

AB Background Plant root research can provide a way to attain stress-tolerant crops that produce greater yield in a diverse array of conditions. Phenotyping roots in soil is often challenging due to the roots being difficult to access and the use of time consuming manual methods. Rhizotrons allow visual inspection of root growth through transparent surfaces. Agronomists currently manually label photographs of roots obtained from rhizotrons using a line-intersect method to obtain root length density and rooting depth measurements which are essential for their experiments. We investigate the effectiveness of an automated image segmentation method based on the U-Net Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture to enable such measurements. We design a data-set of 50 annotated chicory (Cichorium intybus L.) root images which we use to train, validate and test the system and compare against a baseline built using the Frangi vesselness filter. We obtain metrics using manual annotations and line-intersect counts. Results Our results on the held out data show our proposed automated segmentation system to be a viable solution for detecting and quantifying roots. We evaluate our system using 867 images for which we have obtained line-intersect counts, attaining a Spearman rank correlation of 0.9748 and an r(2) of 0.9217. We also achieve an F-1 of 0.7 when comparing the automated segmentation to the manual annotations, with our automated segmentation system producing segmentations with higher quality than the manual annotations for large portions of the image. Conclusion We have demonstrated the feasibility of a U-Net based CNN system for segmenting images of roots in soil and for replacing the manual line-intersect method. The success of our approach is also a demonstration of the feasibility of deep learning in practice for small research groups needing to create their own custom labelled dataset from scratch.

AB The role of financial agglomeration in China's green development has generated many fascinating debates for scholarly research, but few studies have considered environmental effects of financial agglomeration from the spatial spillover perspective. Taking both natural and socio-economic factors into accounts, this paper explores the interaction between financial agglomeration and green development using the panel data of 285 prefecture-level Chinese cities from 2003 to 2015. The results show that both financial agglomeration and green development have demonstrated a trend of spatial convergence. Secondly, financial agglomeration can promote the green development of both focal and surrounding cities. Thirdly, financial agglomeration is conducive to enhance regional green development level in Western China, while only Eastern and Central China witness significant spatial spillover effects. Fourthly, the direct effect of financial agglomeration on green development at the city level exists, whereas megacities and large cities witness a significantly adverse spatial spillover effect. This paper also presents policy recommendations. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Plant functional trait shifts explain concurrent changes in the

AB 1. Land-use intensification drives changes in microbial communities and the soil functions they regulate, but the mechanisms underlying these changes are poorly understood as land use can affect soil communities both directly (e.g. via changes in soil fertility) and indirectly (e.g. via changes in plant inputs).
   2. The speed of microbial responses is also poorly understood. For instance, whether it is long-term legacies or short-term changes in land-use intensity that drive changes in microbial communities.
   3. To address these topics, we measured multiple microbial functions, bacterial and fungal biomass and abiotic soil properties at two time intervals 3 years apart. This was performed in 150 grassland sites differing greatly in management intensity across three German regions.
   4. Observed changes in microbial soil properties were related to both long-term means and short-term changes in: abiotic soil properties, land-use intensity, community abundance-weighted means of plant functional traits and plant biomass properties in regression and structural equation models. Plant traits, particularly leaf phosphorus, and soil pH were the best predictors of change in soil microbial function, as well as fungal and bacterial biomass, while land-use intensity showed weaker effects.
   5. Indirect legacy effects, in which microbial change was explained by the effects of long-term land-use intensity on plant traits, were important, thus indicating a time lag between plant community and microbial change. Whenever the effects of short-term changes in land-use intensity were present, they acted directly on soil microorganisms.
   6. Synthesis. The results provide new evidence that soil communities and their functioning respond to short-term changes in land-use intensity, but that both rapid and longer time-scale responses to changes in plant functional traits are at least of equal importance. This suggests that management which shapes plant communities may be an effective means of managing soil communities and the functions and services they provide.

AB Bacteria are ubiquitous throughout the earth's lower atmosphere. Bacteria, especially pathogenic bacteria, play an important role in human health. The diversity, composition, and dynamics of airborne bacteria has been widely studied: however, the characteristics of pathogenic bacteria remain poorly understood. In this study, a high throughput sequencing method was used to explore the airborne opportunistic pathogenic bacteria during autumn and winter in Van. China. An aggregated boosted tree (ABT) was developed to determine the relative influence of environmental factors on the proportions of opportunistic pathogenic bacteria. Results showed that significantly more opportunistic pathogenic bacteria were found in winter than in autumn, and more opportunistic pathogenic bacteria were found in fine particulate matters (<2.5 mu m) than in PM10 (<10 mu m). However, the composition of opportunistic pathogenic bacteria varied in autumn and winter. PM was the main factor affecting the proportions of opportunistic pathogenic bacteria, and air contaminants (PM, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, carbon monoxide, and ozone) influenced the proportion of opportunistic pathogenic bacteria more than meteorological factors (relative humidity, temperature, and wind speed). Different factors may be responsible for the variances in opportunistic pathogenic bacterial communities in different seasons. This study may provide a reference to support the control of pathogenic bacteria in urban environments during haze events. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Environmental legislation in many countries demands the rehabilitation of degraded areas to minimize environmental impacts. Brazilian laws require the restitution of self-sustaining ecosystems to historical conditions but ignore the emergence of novel ecosystems due to large-scale changes, such as species invasions, extinctions, and land-use or climate changes, although these novel ecosystems might fulfill ecosystem services in similar ways as historic ecosystems. Thorough discussions of rehabilitation goals, target ecosystems, applied methods, and approaches to achieving mine land rehabilitation, as well as dialogues about the advantages and risks of chemical inputs or non-native, non-invasive species that include all political, economic, social, and academic stakeholders are necessary to achieve biological feasibility, sociocultural acceptance, economic viability, and institutional tractability during environmental rehabilitation. Scientific knowledge of natural and rehabilitating ecosystems is indispensable for advancing these discussions and achieving more sustainable mining. Both mining companies and public institutions are responsible for obtaining this knowledge.

AB Biological invasions are a leading cause of global environmental change given their effects on both humans and biodiversity. Humans introduce invasive alien species and may facilitate their establishment and spread, which can alter ecosystem services, livelihoods, and human well-being. People perceive the benefits and costs of these species through the lens of diverse value systems; these perspectives influence decisions about when and where to manage them. Despite the entanglement of humans with invasive alien species, most research on the topic has focused on their ecological aspects. Only relatively recently have the human and social dimensions of invasions started to receive sustained attention in light of their importance for understanding and governing biological invasions. This editorial draws on contributions to a special issue on the "Human and Social Dimensions of Invasion Science" and other literature to elucidate major trends and current contributions in this research area. We examine the relation between humans and biological invasions in terms of four crosscutting themes: (1) how people cause biological invasions; (2) how people conceptualise and perceive them; (3) how people are affected - both positively and negatively - by them; and (4) how people respond to them. We also highlight several ways in which research on the human and social dimensions of invasion science improves understanding, stakeholder engagement, and management.

AB Nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB) are key players in the second step of nitrification, which is an important process in the soil nitrogen (N) cycle. However, the ecology of nitrite oxidizers and their response to disturbances such as long-term fertilization practices are scarcely known in agricultural ecosystems. We used samples from a Red soil subject to a long-term chemical and organic fertilization experiment, including control without fertilizer (CK), swine manure (M), chemical fertilization (NPK), and chemical/manure combined fertilization (MNPK) treatment, to explore how agricultural practices impact the community structure, abundance, and potential activity of nitrite oxidizers (PNO). The abundance of Nitrobacter was significantly increased in the M and MNPK plots, whereas the abundance of Nitrospira was significantly reduced in the M and NPK treatment plots and less inhibited in the MNPK treatment. The PNO showed a similar trend to that for Nitrobacter abundance. The diversity of Nitrobacter increased in the M-treated plots, while that of Nitrospira increased in the M and MNPK plots and decreased in the NPK plots. Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) revealed that the Nitrobacter- and Nitrospira-like NOB community was shift in these four fertilization treatments. Redundancy analysis showed that pH + SOC (soil organic carbon) and pH + TN (total nitrogen) significantly explained the variation in the composition of Nitrobacter and Nitrospira, respectively. In addition, the Nitrospira/Nitrobacter abundance ratio and community structure of Nitrobacter- and Nitrospira-like NOB are responsible for the changes of soil PNO. Collectively, these data suggest that the nitrite-oxidation process in the red soil is possibly controlled by both Nitrospira and Nitrobacter-like NOB, which were shaped by pH + TN and pH + SOC, respectively.

AB Construction of small hydropower plants (<10 megawatts) is booming worldwide, exacerbating ongoing habitat fragmentation and degradation, and further fueling biodiversity loss. A systematic approach for selecting hydropower sites within river networks may help to minimize the detrimental effects of small hydropower on biodiversity. In addition, a better understanding of reach- and basin-scale impacts is key for designing planning tools. We synthesize the available information about (1) reach-scale and (2) basin-scale impacts of small hydropower plants on biodiversity and ecosystem function, and (3) interactions with other anthropogenic stressors. We then discuss state-of-the-art, spatially explicit planning tools and suggest how improved knowledge of the ecological and evolutionary impacts of hydropower can be incorporated into project development. Such tools can be used to balance the benefits of hydropower production with the maintenance of ecosystem services and biodiversity conservation. Adequate planning tools that consider basin-scale effects and interactions with other stressors, such as climate change, can maximize long-term conservation.

AB This paper proposes a processing chain for the derivation of global Leaf Area Index (LAI), Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FAPAR), Fraction Vegetation Cover (FVC), and Canopy water content (CWC) maps from 15-years of MODIS data exploiting the capabilities of the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud platform. The retrieval chain is based on a hybrid method inverting the PROSAIL radiative transfer model (RTM) with Random forests (RF) regression. A major feature of this work is the implementation of a retrieval chain exploiting the GEE capabilities using global and climate data records (CDR) of both MODIS surface reflectance and LAI/FAPAR datasets allowing the global estimation of biophysical variables at unprecedented timeliness. We combine a massive global compilation of leaf trait measurements (TRY), which is the baseline for more realistic leaf parametrization for the considered RTM, with large amounts of remote sensing data ingested by GEE. Moreover, the proposed retrieval chain includes the estimation of both FVC and CWC, which are not operationally produced for the MODIS sensor. The derived global estimates are validated over the BELMANIP2.1 sites network by means of an inter-comparison with the MODIS LAI/FAPAR product available in GEE. Overall, the retrieval chain exhibits great consistency with the reference MODIS product = 0.92, RMSE = 0.09 and ME = 0.05 in the case of FAPAR). The analysis of the results by land cover type shows the lowest correlations between our retrievals and the MODIS reference estimates (R = 0.42 and R = 0.41 for LAI and FAPAR, respectively) for evergreen broadleaf forests. These discrepancies could be attributed mainly to different product definitions according to the literature. The provided results proof that GEE is a suitable high performance processing tool for global biophysical variable retrieval for a wide range of applications.

AB Climate extremes and land-use changes can have major impacts on the carbon cycle of ecosystems. Their combined effects have rarely been tested. We studied whether and how the abandonment of traditionally managed mountain grassland changes the resilience of carbon dynamics to drought. In an in situ common garden experiment located in a subalpine meadow in the Austrian Central Alps, we exposed intact ecosystem monoliths from a managed and an abandoned mountain grassland to an experimental early-summer drought and measured the responses of gross primary productivity, ecosystem respiration, phytomass and its components, and of leaf area index during the drought and the subsequent recovery period. Across all these parameters, the managed grassland was more strongly affected by drought and recovered faster than the abandoned grassland. A bivariate representation of resilience confirmed an inverse relationship of resistance and recovery; thus, low resistance was related to high recovery from drought and vice versa. In consequence, the overall perturbation of the carbon cycle caused by drought was larger in the managed than the abandoned grassland. The faster recovery of carbon dynamics from drought in the managed grassland was associated with a significantly higher uptake of nitrogen from soil. Furthermore, in both grasslands leaf nitrogen concentrations were enhanced after drought and likely reflected drought-induced increases in nitrogen availability. Our study shows that ongoing and future land-use changes have the potential to profoundly alter the impacts of climate extremes on grassland carbon dynamics.

AB Increasingly detailed records of long-term fire regime characteristics are needed to test ecological concepts and inform natural resource management and policymaking. We reconstructed and analyzed twelve 350+ yr-long fire scar records developed from 2612 tree-ring dated fire scars on 432 living and dead pine (Pinus pungens, Pinus rigida, Pinus resinosa, Pinus echinata) trees from across central Pennsylvania. We used multiple spatial and time series analysis methods to quantify fire regime characteristics (frequency, seasonality, percentages of trees scarred, extent) and fire-climate-human associations. Prior to the 20th-century fire suppression, fire regimes at the majority of sites consisted of frequent, low-to-moderate severity, dormant season fires. Fires were often regionally synchronous when preceded by significantly dry years. Using documentary archives, we provide the first description of a "wave of fire"-an anthropogenic signal in fire frequency that progressively moved across the region. This "wave of fire" reflects a changing progression of anthropogenic fire regimes from Native American occupation and depopulation, to Euro-American settlement, to industrialization and declining fire use up to the 20th century era of fire suppression. The wave of fire provides a new perspective on historical and modern fire regime dynamics and identifies socio-ecological impacts since North American colonization. Because the anthropogenic wave of fire exists at sites across North America, we emphasize the need for a broader determination of its geographic prevalence and variability as such determinations could influence historical ecology interpretations and perspectives on past and future roles of humans in managing ecosystems with fire.

TI Comparing SVM and ANN based Machine Learning Methods for Species
   Identification of Food Contaminating Beetles
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS

DT Article
ID SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; INSECT IDENTIFICATION; TOOL
AB Insect pests, such as pantry beetles, are often associated with food contaminations and public health risks. Machine learning has the potential to provide a more accurate and efficient solution in detecting their presence in food products, which is currently done manually. In our previous research, we demonstrated such feasibility where Artificial Neural Network ( ANN) based pattern recognition techniques could be implemented for species identification in the context of food safety. In this study, we present a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model which improved the average accuracy up to 85%. Contrary to this, the ANN method yielded similar to 80% accuracy after extensive parameter optimization. Both methods showed excellent genus level identification, but SVM showed slightly better accuracy for most species. Highly accurate species level identification remains a challenge, especially in distinguishing between species from the same genus which may require improvements in both imaging and machine learning techniques. In summary, our work does illustrate a new SVM based technique and provides a good comparison with the ANN model in our context. We believe such insights will pave better way forward for the application of machine learning towards species identification and food safety.

AB 1. Community ecology is frequently invoked as complementary to and useful for guiding ecological restoration. While the conceptual literature is devoted to this unification, first-hand accounts from practitioners and ecologists suggest that integration may be weak in practice. To date, there have been no analyses of how extensively community ecology theory appears in the empirical restoration literature.
   2. We address this knowledge gap with the first quantitative assessment of the extent to which community ecology concepts appear in empirical restoration literature by analysing the use of community ecology theories, concepts and conceptually derived tools in the design and interpretation of 1,000+ experimental ecological restoration studies over time (20 years) across all global regions. We also gauge general trends in author demographics, focal ecosystems and taxa targeted by these studies.
   3. We found that the incorporation of community ecology into restoration research has increased significantly in recent years.
   4. Community assembly and succession theories were the community ecology concepts integrated most often, while the functional traits framework and evolutionary theory have increased in usage recently.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Restoration endeavours are increasingly infused with elements of community ecology. Our results highlight the widespread application of deterministic models of community structure in restoration design and the rise of ecosystem service and function-focused restoration. With this diagnostic summary of these applications, ecologists and restoration practitioners can move forward while directly exploring underdeveloped synergies between theory and practice.

AB Photosynthetic acclimation (photoacclimation) is the process whereby leaves alter their morphology and/or biochemistry to optimize photosynthetic efficiency and productivity according to long-term changes in the light environment. The three-dimensional architecture of plant canopies imposes complex light dynamics, but the drivers for photoacclimation in such fluctuating environments are poorly understood. A technique for high-resolution three-dimensional reconstruction was combined with ray tracing to simulate a daily time course of radiation profiles for architecturally contrasting field-grown wheat (Triticum aestivum) canopies. An empirical model of photoacclimation was adapted to predict the optimal distribution of photosynthesis according to the fluctuating light patterns throughout the canopies. While the photoacclimation model output showed good correlation with field-measured gas-exchange data at the top of the canopy, it predicted a lower optimal light-saturated rate of photosynthesis at the base. Leaf Rubisco and protein contents were consistent with the measured optimal light-saturated rate of photosynthesis. We conclude that, although the photosynthetic capacity of leaves is high enough to exploit brief periods of high light within the canopy (particularly toward the base), the frequency and duration of such sunflecks are too small to make acclimation a viable strategy in terms of carbon gain. This suboptimal acclimation renders a large portion of residual photosynthetic capacity unused and reduces photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency at the canopy level, with further implications for photosynthetic productivity. It is argued that (1) this represents an untapped source of photosynthetic potential and (2) canopy nitrogen could be lowered with no detriment to carbon gain or grain protein content.

AB Water stress is a key stressor in Mediterranean intermittent rivers exacerbating the negative effects of other stressors, such as pollutants, with multiple effects on different river biota. The current study aimed to determine the response of macroinvertebrate and fish assemblages to instream habitat and water chemistry, at the microhabitat scale and at different levels of water stress and pollution, in an intermittent Mediterranean river. Sampling was conducted at high and low summer discharge, at two consecutive years, and included four reaches that were targeted for their different levels of water stress and pollution. Overall, the macroinvertebrate fauna of Evrotas River indicated high resilience to intermittency, however, variation in community structure and composition occurred under acute water stress, due to habitat alteration and change in water physico-chemistry, i.e. water temperature increase. The combined effects of pollution and high water stress had, however, pronounced effects on species richness, abundance and community structure in the pollution impacted reach, where pollution sensitive taxa were almost extirpated. Fish response to drought, in reaches free of pollution, consisted of an increase in the abundance of the two small limnophilic species, coupled with their shift to faster flowing riffle habitats, and a reduction in the abundance of the larger, rheophilic species. In the pollution impacted reach, however, the combination of pollution and high water stress led to hypoxic conditions assumed to be the leading cause of the almost complete elimination of the fish assemblage. In contrast, the perennial Evrotas reaches with relatively stable physicochemical conditions, though affected hydrologically by drought, appear to function as refugia for fish during high water stress. When comparing the response of the two biotic groups to combined acute water stress and pollution, it is evident that macroinvertebrates were negatively impacted, but fish were virtually eliminated under the two combined stressors.

AB The potential disturbance of dolphins from tourism boats has been widely discussed in the literature, in terms of both physical vessel presence and associated underwater noise. However, less attention has been paid to the potential impact of non-tourism vessels, despite these being much more widespread and occurring in greater numbers throughout coastal dolphin habitats. The Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin (T. aduncus) community using the Fremantle Inner Harbour, Western Australia, is exposed to high levels of vessel traffic. To investigate whether behavioural responses could be occurring, a non-invasive combination of visual and acoustic monitoring was conducted using a theodolite and an autonomous acoustic logger. Dolphins significantly increased their average movement speeds in high vessel densities, but only for some activity states. Behavioural budgets also changed in the presence of vessels, with animals spending greater time travelling and less time resting or socialising. Finally, multiple whistle characteristics varied with rising levels of broadband noise, and other contextual variables. Despite being acoustically specialised for higher frequencies, dolphins had the strongest acoustic variation during low-frequency noise. This study highlights the complexity of disturbance responses in this species, confirming the need for consideration of both surface and acoustic behaviour alongside appropriate contextual data.

AB Intense droughts combined with increased temperatures are one of the major threats to forest persistence in the 21st century. Despite the direct impact of climate change on forest growth and shifts in species abundance, the effect of altered demography on changes in the composition of functional traits is not well known. We sought to (1) quantify the recent changes in functional composition of European forests; (2) identify the relative importance of climate change, mean climate and forest development for changes in functional composition; and (3) analyse the roles of tree mortality and growth underlying any functional changes in different forest types. We quantified changes in functional composition from the 1980s to the 2000s across Europe by two dimensions of functional trait variation: the first dimension was mainly related to changes in leaf mass per area and wood density (partially related to the trait differences between angiosperms and gymnosperms), and the second dimension was related to changes in maximum tree height. Our results indicate that climate change and mean climatic effects strongly interacted with forest development and it was not possible to completely disentangle their effects. Where recent climate change was not too extreme, the patterns of functional change generally followed the expected patterns under secondary succession (e.g. towards late-successional short-statured hardwoods in Mediterranean forests and taller gymnosperms in boreal forests) and latitudinal gradients (e.g. larger proportion of gymnosperm-like strategies at low water availability in forests formerly dominated by broad-leaved deciduous species). Recent climate change generally favoured the dominance of angiosperm-like related traits under increased temperature and intense droughts. Our results show functional composition changes over relatively short time scales in European forests. These changes are largely determined by tree mortality, which should be further investigated and modelled to adequately predict the impacts of climate change on forest function.

AB Developing sustainable adaptation pathways under climate change conditions in mountain regions requires accurate predictions of treeline shifts and future distribution ranges of treeline species. Here, we model for the first time the potential distribution of Betula utilis, a principal Himalayan treeline species, to provide a basis for the analysis of future range shifts. Our target species Betula utilis is widespread at alpine treelines in the Himalayan mountains, the distribution range extends across the Himalayan mountain range. Our objective is to model the potential distribution of B. utilis in relation to current climate conditions. We generated a dataset of 590 occurrence records and used 24 variables for ecological niche modelling. We calibrated Generalized Linear Models using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and evaluated model performance using threshold-independent (AUC, Area Under the Curve) and threshold-dependent (TSS, True Skill Statistics) characteristics as well as visual assessments of projected distribution maps. We found two temperature-related (Mean Temperature of the Wettest Quarter, Temperature Annual Range) and three precipitation-related variables (Precipitation of the Coldest Quarter, Average Precipitation of March, April and May and Precipitation Seasonality) to be useful for predicting the potential distribution of B. utilis. All models had high predictive power (AUC >= 0.98 and TSS >= 0.89). The projected suitable area in the Himalayan mountains varies considerably, with most extensive distribution in the western and central Himalayan region. A substantial difference between potential and real distribution in the eastern Himalaya points to decreasing competitiveness of B. utilis under more oceanic conditions in the eastern part of the mountain system. A comparison between the vegetation map of Schweinfurth (1957) and our current predictions suggests that B. utilis does not reach the upper elevational limit in vast areas of its potential distribution range due to anthropogenically caused treeline depressions. This study underlines the significance of accuracies of current environmental niche models for species distribution modelling under climate change scenarios. Analysing and understanding the environmental factors driving the current distribution of B. utilis is crucial for the prediction of future range shifts of B. utilis and other treeline species, and for deriving appropriate climate change adaptation strategies.

AB The potential of environmental DNA (eDNA) methods to enhance the detection of invasive species during routine monitoring is of interest to management agencies. Here we applied the eDNA methodology concurrent with conventional detection techniques during two routine monitoring seasons to detect the presence of three invasive fish in Australia with contrasting spatial distributions (benthopelagic, pelagic and benthic): common carp (Cyprinus carpio), redfin perch (Perca fluviatilis) and Oriental weatherloach (Misgurnus anguillicaudatus). Our objectives were to compare the seasonal detection of the target species using eDNA and conventional detection (fyke nets), determine the relationship between catch per unit effort (CPUE) and DNA copy number and ascertain the best water location (surface vs. subsurface) for eDNA detection. Our results show that eDNA had a higher detection rate than fyke nets for Oriental weatherloach and redfin perch during both the autumn and spring surveys. Common carp was detected at all sites for both seasons using fyke nets and eDNA with the exception of one site during the autumn survey where common carp was captured using fyke nets but no carp eDNA was detected. Season had a significant effect on DNA concentration for common carp (P <.005) and Oriental weatherloach (P=.002) but sampling location (surface vs. subsurface) had no significant effect on DNA concentration for all three species. We found a positive correlation between CPUE and DNA copy number for Oriental weatherloach (r(s) = .718, alpha =.045) and redfin perch (r(s) =.756, alpha =.030) during spring but a non-significat, negative trend was observed for common carp in both seasons (r(s) = -. 357, alpha =.385 spring; rho = -. 539, alpha =.168 autumn). Our results show that eDNA is an effective tool for the detection of single or multiple species to complement the traditional approaches using physical capture. As with all survey methods, the eDNA approach suffers from imperfect detection. We conclude that eDNA survey results are more powerful when used in conjunction with other survey methods as a way to enhance detection rates and increase confidence in the monitoring results.

AB Genetic diversity provides the essential basis for the adaptation and resilience of tree species to environmental stress and change. The genetic conservation of tree species is an urgent global necessity as forest conversion and fragmentation continue apace, damaging insects and pathogens are transported between continents, and climate change alters local habitat suitability. Effective and efficient genetic conservation of tree species presents a substantial challenge because of the lack of basic information about many species, inadequate resources, and a historical lack of coordination within and between conservation sectors. Several cooperative efforts are already under way and are achieving conservation success, but much work remains. The Gene Conservation of Tree Species-Banking on the Future workshop in 2016 enabled the exchange of information and the creation of collaborations among tree conservation stakeholders. Several key themes emerged during the meeting's presentations and dialogue, which are further explored in this paper. In situ conservation of species is the long-term goal and is often the most efficient approach for preserving the genetic diversity of many forest tree species. Whether existing reserves adequately protect species and are sufficient for future conservation needs is uncertain. Ex situ conservation is an important complement to in situ efforts, acting as an insurance measure against extinction, providing material for restoration, enabling additional research opportunities, and educating the public. Networks of botanic gardens, government agencies, and non-governmental organizations must continue to coordinate ex situ and in situ efforts to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of tree conservation efforts. Assessing and prioritizing which species and populations require genetic conservation and prioritizing among them is a critical need. Two key tree restoration needs are for wider dissemination of planting stock, particularly stock with resistance to insects and pathogens, and for specific silvicultural prescriptions that facilitate restoration efforts. Effective genetic conservation of forest trees will require ongoing cooperation among widely diverse groups of scientists, managers, and policymakers from the public and private sectors.

AB Global trade facilitates the inadvertent movement of insect pests and subsequent establishment of populations outside their native ranges. Despite phytosanitary measures, nonnative insects arrive at United States (U.S.) ports of entry as larvae in solid wood packaging material (SWPM). Identification of wood-boring larval insects is important for pest risk analysis and management, but is difficult beyond family level due to highly conserved morphology. Therefore, we integrated DNA barcoding and rearing of larvae to identify wood-boring insects in SWPM. From 2012 to 2015, we obtained larvae of 338 longhorned beetles (Cerambycidae) and 38 metallic wood boring beetles (Buprestidae) intercepted in SWPM associated with imported products at six U.S. ports. We identified 265 specimens to species or genus using DNA barcodes. Ninety-three larvae were reared to adults and identified morphologically. No conflict was found between the two approaches, which together identified 275 cerambycids (23 genera) and 16 buprestids (4 genera). Our integrated approach confirmed novel DNA barcodes for seven species (10 specimens) of woodborers not in public databases. This study demonstrates the utility of DNA barcoding as a tool for regulatory agencies. We provide important documentation of potential beetle pests that may cross country borders through the SWPM pathway.

AB Demographic bottlenecks that occur when populations fluctuate in size erode genetic diversity, but that diversity can be recovered through immigration. Connectivity among populations and habitat patches in the landscape enhances immigration and should in turn facilitate recovery of genetic diversity after a sudden reduction in population size. For the conservation of genetic diversity, it may therefore be particularly important to maintain connectivity in the face of factors that increase demographic instability, such as climate change. However, a direct link between connectivity and recovery of genetic diversity after a demographic bottleneck has not been clearly demonstrated in an empirical system. Here, we show that connectivity of habitat patches in the landscape contributes to the maintenance of genetic diversity after a demographic bottleneck. We were able to monitor genetic diversity in a network of populations of the alpine butterfly, Parnassius smintheus, before, during, and after a severe reduction in population size that lasted two generations. We found that allelic diversity in the network declined after the demographic bottleneck but that less allelic diversity was lost from populations occupying habitat patches with higher connectivity. Furthermore, the effect of connectivity on allelic diversity was important during the demographic recovery phase. Our results demonstrate directly the ability of connectivity to mediate the rescue of genetic diversity in a natural system.

AB An acoustic community is defined as an aggregation of species that produces sound by using internal or extra-body sound-producing tools. Such communities occur in aquatic (freshwater and marine) and terrestrial environments. An acoustic community is the biophonic component of a soundtope and is characterized by its acoustic signature, which results from the distribution of sonic information associated with signal amplitude and frequency. Distinct acoustic communities can be described according to habitat, the frequency range of the acoustic signals, and the time of day or the season. Near and far fields can be identified empirically, thus the acoustic community can be used as a proxy for biodiversity richness.
   The importance of ecoacoustic research is rapidly growing due to the increasing awareness of the intrusion of anthropogenic sounds (technophonies) into natural and human-modified ecosystems and the urgent need to adopt more efficient predictive tools to compensate for the effects of climate change. The concept of an acoustic community provides an operational scale for a non-intrusive biodiversity survey and analysis that can be carried out using new passive audio recording technology, coupled with methods of vast data processing and storage.

AB A Bayesian network classifier can be used to estimate the probability of an air pollutant overcoming a certain threshold. Yet multiple predictions are typically required regarding variables which are stochastically dependent, such as ozone measured in multiple stations or assessed according to by different indicators. The common practice (independent approach) is to devise an independent classifier for each class variable being predicted; yet this approach overlooks the dependencies among the class variables. By appropriately modeling such dependencies one can improve the accuracy of the forecasts. We address this problem by designing a multi-label classifier, which simultaneously predict multiple air pollution variables. To this end we design a multi-label classifier based on Bayesian networks and learn its structure through structural learning. We present experiments in three different case studies regarding the prediction of PM2.5 and ozone. The multi-label classifier outperforms the independent approach, allowing to take better decisions.

AB Only two vascular plants have been able to colonize some of the ice and snow-free lands of the Antarctic Peninsula: the hair grass Deschampsia antarctica (Poaceae) and the pearlwort Colobanthus quitensis (Caryophyllaceae). This low species diversity may be due to the permanent low temperature even during summer time. Beside low temperature, Antarctic plants must be able to cope with other severe physiological stressors such as desiccation, low soil water availability, and high irradiance. However, these factors are found in other cold areas of the globe. Thus, what is so special about these two species that has enabled them to be the only successful flowering plants in the Antarctica? Although this question has been addressed in other articles, we still lack of an integrative ecophysiological framework that helps to disentangle what it is unique of these species in terms of adaptations to the Antarctic environments, and how these adaptations will help or preclude their responses to future climate change. Several adaptations seem to help to withstand the Antarctic climate: xerophytic anatomical characteristics, sufficient freezing tolerance, ability to maintain positive net photosynthesis at near 0 degrees C, adequate management of excess photosynthetic active radiation, resistance to photoinhibitory conditions, tolerance to water stress, and ability to form associations with endophytes that help in their mineral nutrition. Besides the very effective stress tolerance strategies, several ecophysiological traits show considerable response flexibility. The evidence reviewed here indicates that small increases in air temperature may be beneficial in terms of photosynthetic performance. However, increased frequency of leaf temperatures over 20 degrees C could be harmful affecting photosynthesis and reducing the ability of these plants to tolerate freezing temperatures and photoprotection at low temperatures, attributes by which they are able to colonize these very harsh environment.

AB To investigate the spatial distribution of microbial communities and their drivers in petroleum reservoir environments, we performed pyrosequencing of microbial partial 16S rRNA, derived from 20 geographically separated water-flooding reservoirs, and two reservoirs that had not been flooded, in China. The results indicated that distinct underground microbial communities inhabited the different reservoirs. Compared with the bacteria, archaeal alpha-diversity was not strongly correlated with the environmental variables. The variation of the bacterial and archaeal community compositions was affected synthetically, by the mining patterns, spatial isolation, reservoir temperature, salinity and pH of the formation brine. The environmental factors explained 64.22% and 78.26% of the total variance for the bacterial and archaeal communities, respectively. Despite the diverse community compositions, shared populations (48 bacterial and 18 archaeal genera) were found and were dominant in most of the oilfields. Potential indigenous microorganisms, including Carboxydibrachium, Thermosinus, and Neptunomonas, were only detected in a reservoir that had not been flooded with water. This study indicates that: 1) the environmental variation drives distinct microbial communities in different reservoirs; 2) compared with the archaea, the bacterial communities were highly heterogeneous within and among the reservoirs; and 3) despite the community variation, some microorganisms are dominant in multiple petroleum reservoirs.

AB Migratory marine species present challenges for conservation because of complex threats within their pelagic dispersal zones, including coastal foraging areas and extensive migration pathways, or at breeding grounds. To better understand the connectivity between green turtle rookeries and foraging populations, we sequenced the mtDNA control region of 987 turtles from 6 major foraging grounds on a similar to 2300 km longitudinal transect off eastern Australia, and used mixed stock analysis (MSA) to estimate their natal origins. We investigated variation in natal origins within different size classes and over spatial and temporal scales and compared this to approximately 30 yr of mark-recapture data. For adult turtles, we found that the northern Great Barrier Reef (nGBR) genetic stock dominated in the northern feeding grounds while the southern Great Barrier Reef (sGBR) and Coral Sea stocks dominated in the south, with a changeover of dominating stock occurring between 14 degrees and 20 degrees S. However, at the 3 most northern feeding grounds, we found an unexpected decrease (17-30%) in the proportion of nGBR turtles among small immature turtles relative to large immatures and adults. Four possible hypotheses were explored, with the 2 most plausible being that (1) small immature turtles from the sGBR and other rookeries first settle in nGBR feeding grounds, but later shift to other feeding grounds as they mature, or (2) a reduced hatching success for decades from the main nGBR rookery at Raine Island has resulted in reduced recruitment into the nGBR feeding ground from this stock. These results may indicate an alarming reduction in hatching success at the largest known green turtle rookery in the world.

AB Oxides of Nitrogen (NOx) is a major component of photochemical smog and its constituents are considered principal traffic-related pollutants affecting human health. This study investigates the influence of background concentrations of NOx traffic density, and prevailing meteorological conditions on roadside concentrations of NOx at UK urban, open motorway, and motorway tunnel sites using the statistical approach Boosted Regression Trees (BRT). BRT models have been fitted using hourly concentration, traffic, and meteorological data for each site. The models predict, rank, and visualise the relationship between model variables and roadside NOx concentrations. A strong relationship between roadside NOx and monitored local background concentrations is demonstrated. Relationships between roadside NOx and other model variables have been shown to be strongly influenced by the quality and resolution of background concentrations of NOx, i.e. if it were based on monitored data or modelled prediction. The paper proposes a direct method of using site-specific fundamental diagrams for splitting traffic data into four traffic states: free-flow, busy-flow, congested, and severely congested. Using BRT models, the density of traffic (vehicles per kilometre) was observed to have a proportional influence on the concentrations of roadside NOx, with different fitted regression line slopes for the different traffic states. When other influences are conditioned out, the relationship between roadside concentrations and ambient air temperature suggests NOx concentrations reach a minimum at around 22 degrees C with high concentrations at low ambient air temperatures which could be associated to restricted atmospheric dispersion and/or to changes in road traffic exhaust emission characteristics at low ambient air temperatures. This paper uses BRT models to study how different critical factors, and their relative importance, influence the variation of roadside NOx concentrations. The paper highlights the importance of either setting up local background continuous monitors or improving the quality and resolution of modelled UK background maps and the need to further investigate the influence of ambient air temperature on NOx emissions and roadside NOx concentrations.

AB Fungi belonging to the genus of Alternaria are recognised as being significant plant pathogens, and Alternaria allergens are one of the most important causes of respiratory allergic diseases in Europe. This study aims to provide a detailed and original analysis of Alternaria transport dynamics in Badajoz, SW Spain. This was achieved by examining daily mean and hourly observations of airborne Alternaria spores recorded during days with high airborne concentrations of Alternaria spores (>100 s m(-3)) from 2009 to 2011, as well as four inventory maps of major Alternaria habitats, the overall synoptic weather situation and analysis of air mass transport using Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory model and geographic information systems. Land use calculated within a radius of 100 km from Badajoz shows that crops and grasslands are potentially the most important local sources of airborne Alternaria spores recorded at the site. The results of back trajectory analysis show that, during the examined four episodes, the two main directions where Alternaria source areas were located were: (1) SW-W; and (2) NW-NE. Regional scale and long distance transport could therefore supplement the airborne catch recorded at Badajoz with Alternaria conidia originating from sources such as crops and orchards situated in other parts of the Iberian Peninsula.

AB Amphibians are the most threatened vertebrate taxon of modern times. Baseline data and affordable methods to monitor populations are absent for many Australian frog species. Furthermore, some species are visually cryptic, and detection often relies upon male advertisement calls. Imperfect detection rates impede our ability to assess the status of populations over time. Understanding the factors that influence calling is essential to inform the timing of survey effort and increase survey efficiency. Automated recording systems offer considerable potential to determine calling phenology and establish the relationship between calling and abiotic factors. The mountain frogs (PhiloriaMyobatrachidae) of the Gondwana rainforests are considered susceptible to climate change impacts, such as shifts in the timing of calling. In order to describe the calling phenology of Philoria richmondensis, commercially available automated recording systems were deployed at five locations, and over 5000h of sound recordings were captured and analysed. Peak calling activity occurred during morning and evening periods in the austral spring. Ambient temperature was found to significantly contribute to the probability of a call occurring, with the highest frequency of calls recorded occurring between 15 degrees C and 16 degrees C, and there was a negative relationship between precipitation and calling activity. The results allow future surveys to be better targeted and provide a benchmark with which to detect changes in calling phenology over time.

AB Collecting seed from natural plant populations is a key tool for conservation, ecological restoration, assisted migration, studying plant mating systems, and crop breeding. Many collections rely on simple, broadly-applied rules-of-thumb for minimum sample sizes, regardless of species' natural history, and are likely inadequate for obtaining sufficient genetic representation. There is a current paucity of information about how various logistical and biological factors influence seed sampling outcomes. Here we use simulated and empirical data to, for the first time, quantitatively evaluate the degree to which collection effectiveness is influenced by spatial arrangement, sampling intensity, and species' reproductive biology. We clearly and quantitatively demonstrate that collections with spatially limited or biased sampling arrangements, or collections from species with high selfing or low dispersal, will need substantially more samples than are commonly recommended, or else will fail to reach the targeted genetic diversity. We also show that the marginal gain from sampling additional maternal plants will nearly always exceed that of additional seeds. Lastly we show that random sampling outperforms "easy access" and "transect" sampling by 70% and 30%, respectively. Overall, we conclude that collection guidelines tailored to particular taxa will help facilitate optimal sampling design. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Surface and subsurface sediments in river ecosystems are recognized as refuges that may promote invertebrate survival during disturbances such as floods and streambed drying. Refuge use is spatiotemporally variable, with environmental factors including substrate composition, in particular the proportion of fine sediment (FS), affecting the ability of organisms to move through interstitial spaces. We conducted a laboratory experiment to examine the effects of FS on the movement of Gammarus pulex Linnaeus (Crustacea: Amphipoda) into subsurface sediments in response to surface water loss. We hypothesized that increasing volumes of FS would impede and ultimately prevent individuals from migrating into the sediments. To test this hypothesis, the proportion of FS (1-2 mm diameter) present within an open gravel matrix (4-16 mm diameter) was varied from 10 to 20% by volume in 2.5% increments. Under control conditions (0% FS), 93% of individuals moved into subsurface sediments as the water level was reduced. The proportion of individuals moving into the subsurface decreased to 74% at 10% FS, and at 20% FS no individuals entered the sediments, supporting our hypothesis. These results demonstrate the importance of reducing FS inputs into river ecosystems and restoring FS-clogged riverbeds, to promote refuge use during increasingly common instream disturbances.

AB The objective of this study was to estimate the recovery trajectory of evapotranspiration (E-t) and streamflow (Q) in resprouting forested catchments following wildfire. Recovery dynamics were assessed in mixed species eucalypt forests in south-eastern Australia which recover from disturbance largely via vegetative resprouting, and to a lesser degree, via seedling recruitment. Changes in E-t were evaluated in two ways. Firstly, we developed semi-empirical models of post-fire E-t following moderate and high severity wildfire. These models were based on datasets of plot-scale E-t, measured within five years post-fire, and published literature on post-fire changes in vegetation structure. Secondly, we analysed long-term Q records (25 years) from a mixed species catchment, including a 1-5 year period following a predominately moderate severity wildfire. We found that the overall length of recovery time for E-t and Q following wildfire was 8-12 years, which is much less than for eucalypt forests recovering via seedlings only. This emphasises the importance of functional responses to fire in forest ecosystems as a key driver of the hydrologic resilience of catchments, with resprouting forest types conferring relatively rapid recovery following disturbance. We also found that the recovery trajectory of post-fire E-t was dependent on fire severity. Increased E-t and consequent declines in Q occurred following moderate severity fire. In contrast, there was no evidence of increased E-t following high severity fire. Based on patterns of long-term Q and rainfall observed in a small mixed species catchment, declines in Q due to increased E-t following moderate severity wildfire were of similar magnitude to Q declines driven by a drought that coincided with the fire. We conclude that the coincidence of wildfire with drought exacerbates reductions in Q under moderate severity fire, resulting in greater Q declines. This is due to the enhanced rates of E-t, primarily driven by regenerating seedlings and higher rates of transpiration from surviving trees. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Deep-water sponges are considered ecosystem engineers, and the presence of large aggregations of these organisms, commonly referred to as sponge grounds, is associated with enhanced biodiversity and abundance of epibenthic fauna compared to non-sponge habitat. However, the degree and magnitude to which the presence of these sponge grounds elicits large changes in composition of the associated megafaunal community remains unknown. Here we identify the external drivers of epibenthic megafaunal community composition and explore the patterns and magnitude of compositional change in the megafaunal community within the sponge grounds of the Sackville Spur, northwest Atlantic. Epibenthic megafauna were quantified from five image transects collected on the Sackville Spur in 2009 between 1080 and 1723 m depth. Using Gradient Forest Modelling we found that the abundance of structure-forming sponges was the most important variable for predicting compositional patterns in the Sackville Spur megafaunal community, followed by depth, range in bottom current speed, in situ salinity, and longitude. Along the gradient in structure-forming sponge abundance, the largest turnover in megafaunal community composition occurred when the sponges reached 15 individuals m(-2). Examination of the regional hydrographic conditions suggests that the dense sponge grounds of the Sackville Spur are associated with a warm, salty water mass that occurs between similar to 1300 and 1800 m.

AB Albacore tuna (Thunnus alalunga) are an important upper tropic-level oceanic predator with a circumglobal distribution. Little is known of the movements and diet of albacore tuna in the South Pacific Ocean and how variability in both might influence the vulnerability of albacore tuna to fisheries across their range. We coupled data derived from satellite-tagged albacore tuna with stomach samples collected from individuals at the same locations to characterize the vertical behavior, thermal and dietary habits of albacore tuna at tropical (New Caledonia and Tonga) and temperate (New Zealand) latitudes. A total of 18 pop-up satellite archival tags deployed on albacore tuna remained attached for 0-50 days. Position estimates, calculated from 11 tags, described short-term movements of predominantly less than 500 km, although one fish moved more than 1000 km over a period of 50 days. Vertical behavior and diet differed substantially between tropical and temperate latitudes. At tropical latitudes, albacore tuna showed a distinct diel pattern in vertical habitat use, occupying shallower, warmer waters above the mixed layer depth (MLD) at night, and deeper, cooler waters below the MLD during the day. In contrast, there was little evidence of a diel pattern of vertical behavior in albacore tuna at temperate latitudes, with fish limited to shallow waters above the MLD almost all of the time. Spatial patterns of species composition in stomach contents were consistent with vertical movement patterns, with significantly more deep-water prey species consumed in tropical waters than in temperate waters. Albacore in tropical waters also consumed significantly greater diversities of prey than in temperate waters, predominately preying on fish species, whereas those in temperate waters predominately preyed on crustacea. Our results indicate that the vertical distribution of albacore is constrained either by thermal preferences with diet reflecting these preferences, by the vertical distribution of prey species, which may be affected by the thermal structure of the ocean, or most likely by a mixture of both. Spatial differences in the vertical distribution of albacore tuna suggest that vulnerability of albacore to oceanic fisheries varies with latitude. Changes in the thermal structure of oceanic waters in temperate areas associated with climate change might influence the vertical distributions and, therefore, vulnerability of albacore to oceanic fisheries into the future.

AB Despite extensive research on the seasonal dynamics of non-structural carbohydrate (NSC) and nitrogen (N) concentrations, the size and relative contributions of NSC and N pools across different tree organs are not well understood. We have measured the changes in NSC and N concentrations in leaves, branches, stems and all root branch orders at monthly intervals in control and girdled trees of larch (Larix gmelinii) and ash (Fraxinus mandshurica). The biomass of each plant compartment was also determined to calculate the size of the NSC and N pools. In both species, 13-37 % of the NSC and N pools were mobilized at the beginning of the growing season. Among the mobilized pools, stems and non-absorptive roots (branch orders 4-9) acted as the largest NSC sources in larch and ash, respectively, while branches served as the largest N source in both species. After stem girdling, 22 and 50 % of the root NSC stores in larch and ash, respectively, were mobilized to maintain root activities during the growing season. Tree mortality was observed 1 year after girdling, at which time there was still an abundant NSC pool in the roots. We conclude that (1) different storage organs differ in their contribution to new tissue growth at the beginning of the growing season and that those storage organs holding higher fractions of the NSC or N pool are not necessarily those which mobilize more NSC or N; (2) tree growth may not be limited by carbon (C) availability; (3) C storage in non-absorptive roots plays an important role in maintaining tree survival after the termination of photosynthate flow from aboveground sources.

AB Shrub species were selected for potential use in restoration projects in the semiarid shrublands of Central Mexico. Ecological characteristics of the species were considered, including tolerance to climate change. Inventories of shrubs were carried out in 17 semiarid shrubland fragments of xeric shrubland. The 46 species recorded were ordered using a principal component analysis, considering ecological characteristics such as frequency, land cover, sociability and interaction with mycorrhizal fungi. From these, the 10 species that presented the highest values of the desired characteristics were selected. The response of these species to climate change was evaluated using current potential distribution models and by applying climate change scenario A2, using MaxEnt. The species that presented suitable ecological qualities for restoration and maintained or increased their distribution under the climate change scenario were Acacia sthaffneri,Ageratina espinosarum, Bursera fagaroides, Dalea bicolor, Eysenhardtia polystachya and Karwinskia humboldtiana. These species are therefore recommended for use in medium and long-term ecological restoration projects in the semi-arid region in Central Mexico. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB AimTo assess environmental changes within a marine biogeographical transition zone and how they have affected seaweed assemblages and distributions over the past two decades.
   LocationBrittany (western France, Europe) - a biogeographical transition zone between cold-temperate and warm-temperate regions.
   MethodsWe assessed spatio-temporal variation for three environmental parameters [sea-surface temperature (SST), suspended inorganic matter and chlorophyll a] between 1992 and 2012 in five adjoining regions using generalized linear models. To investigate changes in assemblages and distributional patterns of red seaweeds based on sampling surveys conducted during two separate periods (1992-1998 and 2010-2012), we used two complementary approaches, multivariate data analysis and species distribution models (SDMs) with a set of modelling procedures.
   ResultsCoastal water temperature in Brittany has increased by 0.7 degrees C on average over the past two decades (0.35 degrees C per decade). At a finer scale, changes in SST showed that Brittany constitutes a mosaic of contrasting conditions, with the western and north-western regions being colder and less affected by climate change than the other three regions. Our results suggest that increasing SST caused significant changes in subtidal red seaweed assemblages over the 20-year period. Between the two periods, SDMs predicted significant species shifts for seven out of ten representative species, and reductions in the distribution ranges of most species.
   Main conclusionsOur study confirmed important differences across the different regions of the studied biogeographical transition zone. Changes in abiotic parameters and red seaweed assemblages are expected to occur at varying extremes across these regions, with western and north-western Brittany representing the most stable zones that might constitute a potential refuge for certain species when responding to global changes.

SO ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS

ID VALUATION; CLASSIFICATION; COMMUNITY; VALUES
AB The concept of ecosystem services was formulated to create a market- and value-based foundation for sustainable natural resource use by land users as well as by planners. The concise definition, measurement and especially valuation of nature's services is challenging, as values are notoriously fluid and there are dimensions of value other than the biophysically or economically measurable. However, the so-called "cultural ecosystem services", which are intended as a way to integrate these immaterial aspects of valuation, pose challenges. It is not clear what they are, to what degree they impact on valuations, or to whom these valuations are most relevant; nor how to integrate them into existing value classifications. Focusing on services as fixed outcomes, rather than processes, prevents the concept from remaining open to local actors' dynamic changes in valuation. Additionally, they are often classified as a Eurocentric residual category for e.g. esthetic and recreational experiences nature provides. Building on anthropological theories and own cases from Angola, Namibia and Botswana, we suggest a definition of culture as a processual activity of meaning-making. By illustratively outlining the locality and culturality of land users' valuation we argue in favor of subjecting universalizing perspectives of ecosystem service valuation to new scrutiny.

AB The phylogeny of Petunia species has been difficult to resolve, primarily due to the recent diversification of the genus. Several studies have included molecular data in phylogenetic reconstructions of this genus, but all of them have failed to include all taxa and/or analyzed few genetic markers. In the present study, we employed the most inclusive genetic and taxonomic datasets for the genus, aiming to reconstruct the evolutionary history of Petunia based on molecular phylogeny, biogeographic distribution, and character evolution. We included all 20 Petunia morphological species or subspecies in these analyses. Based on nine nuclear and five plastid DNA markers, our phylogenetic analysis reinforces the monophyly of the genus Petunia and supports the hypothesis that the basal divergence is more related to the differentiation of corolla tube length, whereas the geographic distribution of species is more related to divergences within these main clades. Ancestral area reconstructions suggest the Pampas region as the area of origin and earliest divergence in Petunia. The state reconstructions suggest that the ancestor of Petunia might have had a short corolla tube and a bee pollination floral syndrome. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB A grass-fire cycle in Australian tropical savannas has been postulated as driving the regional decline of the obligate-seeding conifer Callitris intratropica and other fire-sensitive components of the regional flora and fauna, due to proliferation of flammable native grasses. We tested the hypothesis that a high-biomass invasive savanna grass drives a positive feedback process where intense fires destroy fire-sensitive trees, and the reduction in canopy cover facilitates further invasion by grass. We undertook an observational and experimental study using, as a model system, a plantation of C.intratropica that has been invaded by an African grass, gamba (Andropogon gayanus) in the Northern Territory, Australia. We found that high grass biomass was associated with reduced canopy cover and restriction of foliage to the upper canopy of surviving stems, and mortality of adult trees was very high (>50%) even in areas with low fuel loads (1 t ha(-1)). Experimental fires, with fuel loads >10 t ha(-1), typical of the grass-invasion front, caused significant mortality due to complete crown scorch. Lower fuel loads cause reduced canopy cover through defoliation of the lower canopy. These results help explain how increases in grass biomass are coupled with the decline of C.intratropica throughout northern Australia by causing a switch from litter and sparse perennial grass fuels, and hence low-intensity surface fires, to heavy annual grass fuel loads that sustain fires that burn into the midstorey. This study demonstrates that changes in fuel type can alter fire regimes with substantial knock-on effects on the biota.

AB Prescribed fires are a common management practice in the temperate forests of Australia, but effects on total forest carbon (C) of long-term prescribed fire regimes, involving multiple repeat fires, remain under-examined. This study quantified C stocks in multiple pools after 27 years of a long-term prescribed fire experiment in a mixed-species eucalypt forest in south-eastern Australia. The experimental design included five replications of each of five treatments - a long-unburnt Control, plus a factorial combination of two fire frequencies (c. 3-yearly 'High', c. 10-yearly 'Low'), and two fire seasons (Spring, Autumn) encompassing up to 7 low-intensity repeat fires over the 27 years.
   Overall, total C stocks (the sum of all pools: Above-ground biomass, Dead wood, Litter, and Soil) were significantly greater in Control than Fire treatments. Mean total C stock differences (Control minus Fire) were 36 Mg ha(-1), and increased with both fire frequency (46 Mg ha(-1), Control versus High frequency treatments) and fires in autumn rather than spring (42 Mg ha(-1), Control versus Autumn treatments). Mean differences had wide 95% confidence intervals (e.g. 4-67 Mg C ha(-1), Control versus Fire), indicating considerable uncertainty about the magnitude of effects of prescribed fire regimes on total C in these native forests. Weighted averaging of linear multiple regression models was used to identify the most important variables for explaining proportional C stock differences ((Control-Fire)/Control), and involved consideration of 85 explanatory variables including measures of fire intensity, fire severity, fuel, pre- and post-fire rainfall, fire weather, and topography. The best regression model explained 80% of variation in total C stock differences between Control and Fire treatments. Consistently important explanatory variables were those representing or associated with fire intensity (flame angle, wind speed, Forest Fire Danger Index), and number of prescribed fires. Measures of fuel load, pre- and post-fire rainfall, and, in particular, fire severity, were less important explanatory variables. The study provides indications of management options for minimising C stock decreases associated with prescribed fire regimes in temperate eucalypt forests; notably, wide fire intervals (closer to 10 than 3 years), and utilising strategies to minimise mean fire intensity, including burning in moist (spring) rather than dry (autumn) conditions.

AB Aim: A major problem for conservation in Amazonia is that species distribution maps are inaccurate. Consequently, conservation planning needs to be based on other information sources such as vegetation and soilmaps, which are also inaccurate. We propose and test the use of biotic data on a common and relatively easily inventoried group of plants to infer environmental conditions that can be used to improvemaps of floristic patterns for plants in general.
   Location: Brazilian Amazonia.
   Methods: We sampled 326 plots of 250 m x 2 m separated by distances of 1-1800 km. Terrestrial fern individuals were identified and counted. Edaphic data were obtained from soil samples and analysed for cation concentration and texture. Climatic data were obtained from Worldclim. We used a multivariate regression tree to evaluate the hierarchical importance of soils and climate for fern communities and identified significant indicator species for the resultant classification. We then tested how well the edaphic properties of the plots could be predicted on the basis of their floristic composition using two calibration methods, weighted averaging and k-nearest neighbour estimation.
   Results: Soil cation concentration emerged as the most important variable in the regression tree, whereas soil textural and climatic variation played secondary roles. Almost all the plot classes had several fern species with high indicator values for that class. Soil cation concentration was also the variable most accurately predicted on the basis of fern community composition (R-2 = 0.65-0.75 for log-transformed data). Predictive accuracy varied little among the calibration methods, and was not improved by the use of abundance data instead of presence-absence data.
   Conclusions: Fern species composition can be used as an indicator of soil cation concentration, which can be expected to be relevant also for other components of rain forests. Presence-absence data are adequate for this purpose, which makes the collecting of additional data potentially very rapid. Comparison with earlier studies suggests that edaphic preferences of fern species have good transferability across geographical regions within lowland Amazonia. Therefore, species and environmental data sets already available in the Amazon region represent a good starting point for generating better environmental and floristic maps for conservation planning.

AB Lichens are considered to be among the most sensitive organisms for several types of pollutants. In this work, we analyzed a dataset of 286 epiphytic lichen species observed on 1155 trees at 83 ForestBIOTA plots, which is a subsample of approx. 500 plots of the European ICP Forests Level II network. We aimed at examining the amount of nitrogen deposition for which a significant variation of the relative diversity of morpho-functional groups of epiphytic lichens in the sampled plots is expected. Moreover, the study aimed at determining how much variance of these diversity variables could be explained by nitrogen depositions only. We used correlation and multiple regression models as well as hierarchical partitioning to evaluate the relative importance of environmental predictors in explaining variation in lichen diversity descriptors. The analysis splits the variation explained by each variable into a joint effect together with the other explanatory variables, and into an independent effect not shared with any other variable. The percentage of macrolichens in the plots was shown to be the most important indicator, since 56.7% of its variation could be explained by deposition, particularly by nitrogen compounds. It was shown that approx. 75% of the ForestBIOTA plots are affected by an unsustainably high throughfall nitrogen deposition. Based on these outcomes, it was possible to determine a nitrogen critical load of 2.4 kg ha(-1) yr(-1). (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Dwarf bamboos are an important understory component of the lowland and montane forests in the subtropical regions of Asia and South America, yet little is known about their physiology and phenotypic plasticity in response to changing light environments. To understand how bamboo species adapt to different light intensities, we examined leaf morphological, anatomical, and physiological differentiation of Sinarundinaria nitida (Mitford) Nakai, a subtropical woody dwarf bamboo, growing in open and shaded natural habitats in the Ailao Mountains, SW China. Compared with leaves in open areas, leaves in shaded areas had higher values in leaf size, specific leaf area, leaf nitrogen, and chlorophyll concentrations per unit area but lower values in leaf thickness, vein density, stomatal density, leaf carbon concentration, and total soluble sugar concentration. However, stomatal size and leaf phosphorus concentration per unit mass remained relatively constant regardless of light regime. Leaves in the open habitat exhibited a higher light-saturated net photosynthetic rate, dark respiration rate, non-photochemical quenching, and electron transport rate than those in the shaded habitat. The results of this study revealed that the bamboo species exhibited a high plasticity of its leaf structural and functional traits in response to different irradiances. The combination of high plasticity in leaf morphological, anatomical, and physiological traits allows this bamboo species to grow in heterogeneous habitats.

AB Abundance and density are key pieces of information for questions related to ecology and conservation. These quantities, however, are difficult to obtain for rare and elusive species, where even intensive sampling effort can yield sparse data. Here, we combine data from camera-trapping and noninvasive genetic sampling (scat surveys) of a jaguar population in the Caatinga of northeastern Brazil, where the species is threatened and little studied. We analyze data of both survey types separately and jointly in the framework of spatial capture recapture. Density estimates were 1.45 (+/- 0.46) for the camera-trap data alone, 2.03 (+/- 0.77) for the genetic data alone, and 1.57 (+/- 0.43) and 2.45 (+/- 0.70) for the two methods, respectively, in the joint analysis. Density and other parameters were estimated more precisely in the joint model. Particularly the differences in movement between males and females were estimated much more precisely when combining both data sources, especially compared to the genetic data set alone. When compared to a previous non-spatial capture recapture approach, present density estimates were more precise, demonstrating the superior statistical performance of spatial over non-spatial capture recapture models. The ability to combine different surveys into a single analysis with shared parameter allows for more precise population estimates, while at the same time enabling researchers to employ complementary survey techniques in the study of little known species.

AB 1. The problems of analysing used-available data and presence-only data are equivalent, and this paper uses this equivalence as a platform for exploring opportunities for advancing analysis methodology. 2. We suggest some potential methodological advances in used-available analysis, made possible via lessons learnt in the presence-only literature, for example, using modern methods to improve predictive performance. We also consider the converse - potential advances in presence-only analysis inspired by used-available methodology. 3. Notwithstanding these potential advances in methodology, perhaps a greater opportunity is in advancing our thinking about how to apply a given method to a particular data set. 4. It is shown by example that strikingly different results can be achieved for a single data set by applying a given method of analysis in different ways - hence having chosen a method of analysis, the next step of working out how to apply it is critical to performance. 5. We review some key issues to consider in deciding how to apply an analysis method: apply the method in a manner that reflects the study design; consider data properties; and use diagnostic tools to assess how reasonable a given analysis is for the data at hand.

AB Owing to the increase of boat-traffic in the ocean many studies have been conducted to determine the response of bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) to this kind of disturbance. This species is affected by boats in various ways and the response depends on the behavioural state of the dolphin but also on the kind of vessel. This study aimed to determine the effect of motorboats and trawlers on dolphins' presence, permanence in the area and whistle parameters in Lampedusa waters (Italy). Sampling was carried out between May and December 2006 and between July and September 2009, using experimental passive acoustic monitoring systems (PAM); a total of 300 h of recordings and 3000 whistles were analysed. The dolphins' behavioural strategies depend on the kind of boats: in the case of motorboats, dolphins preferred to leave the area as the disturbance became too heavy to be tolerated; in the case of trawlers, dolphins changed their acoustic behaviour to compensate for the masking noise. The study highlighted the efficacy of PAM to detect the behavioural response of dolphins, suggesting a novel approach to assessing anthropogenic influences on marine mammal vocalizations in the absence of visual observations.

AB Captively reared animals can provide an immediate demographic boost in reintroduction programs, but may also reduce the fitness of colonizing populations. Construction of a fish passage facility at Landsburg Diversion Dam on the Cedar River, WA, USA, provided a unique opportunity to explore this trade-off. We thoroughly sampled adult Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) at the onset of colonization (20032009), constructed a pedigree from genotypes at 10 microsatellite loci, and calculated reproductive success (RS) as the total number of returning adult offspring. Hatchery males were consistently but not significantly less productive than naturally spawned males (range in relative RS: 0.700.90), but the pattern for females varied between years. The sex ratio was heavily biased toward males; therefore, inclusion of the hatchery males increased the risk of a genetic fitness cost with little demographic benefit. Measurements of natural selection indicated that larger salmon had higher RS than smaller fish. Fish that arrived early to the spawning grounds tended to be more productive than later fish, although in some years, RS was maximized at intermediate dates. Our results underscore the importance of natural and sexual selection in promoting adaptation during reintroductions.

AB Habitat fragmentation is one of the most important causes for the decline of plant species. However, plants differing in phylogeny, habitat requirements and biology are likely to respond differently to habitat fragmentation. We ask whether case studies on the effects of habitat fragmentation conducted so far allow generalizations about its effects on the fitness and genetic diversity of populations of endangered plant species. We compared the characteristics of plant species endangered in Germany whose sensitivity to habitat fragmentation had been studied with those of the endangered species that had not been studied. We found strong discrepancies between the two groups with regard to their taxonomy and traits relevant to their sensitivity to habitat fragmentation. Monocots, graminoids, clonal, abiotically pollinated and self compatible species were underrepresented among the studied species, and most study species were from a few habitat types, in particular grasslands. We conclude that our current knowledge of the effects of habitat fragmentation on plant populations is not sufficient to provide widely applicable guidelines for species management. The selection of species studied so far has been biased toward species from certain habitats and species exhibiting traits that probably make them vulnerable to habitat fragmentation. Future studies should include community-wide approaches in different habitats, e.g. re-visitation studies in which the species pool is assessed at different time intervals, and population-biological studies of species from a wide range of habitats, and of different life forms and growth strategies. A more representative picture of the effects of habitat fragmentation would allow a better assessment of threats and more specific recommendations for optimally managing populations of endangered plants.

AB Adaptation of plants or animals to captivity is a risk associated with any captive breeding program that has the intent of returning organisms to the wild. The risk is particularly acute for species that are captively bred and released on a large scale, as is the case for many species of fish. Several studies, particularly in salmonids, have reported rapid adaptation of populations to captivity, but the mechanisms of such adaptations are not always clear. We evaluated a large three-generation pedigree of an artificially supplemented salmon population, and found that the fish with the highest reproductive success in captivity produce early maturing male offspring that have lower than average reproductive success in the wild. In contrast to an earlier study of steelhead trout, we found little evidence that parental origin of the captive spawners influenced the subsequent reproductive success of their naturally spawning progeny.

AB Wildfires are part of the Mediterranean ecosystem, however, in Israel all wildfires are human caused, either intentionally or un-intentionally. In this study we aimed to develop and test a new method for mapping fire scars from MODIS imagery, to examine the temporal and spatial patterns of wildfires in Israel in the 2000s and to examine the factors controlling Israel's wildfire regime. To map the fires we used two 'off-the-shelf' MODIS fire products as our basis-the 1 km MODIS Collection 5 fire hotspots, the 500 m MCD45A1 burnt areas-and we created a new set of fire scar maps from the 250 m MOD13Q1 product We carried out a cross comparison of the three MODIS based wildfire scar maps and evaluated them independently against the wild fire scars mapped from 30 m Landsat TM imagery. To examine the factors controlling wildfires we used GIS layers of rainfall, land use, and a Landsat-based national vegetation map. Wildfires occurred in areas where annual rainfall was above 250 mm, mostly in areas with herbaceous vegetation. Wildfire frequency was especially high in the Golan Heights and in the foothills of the Judean mountains, and a high correspondence was found between military training zones and the spatial distribution of fire scars. The use of MODIS satellite images enabled us to map wildfires at a national scale due to the high temporal resolution of the sensor. Our MOD13Q1 based mapping of fire scars adequately mapped large (> 1 km(2)) fires with accuracies above 80%. Such large fires account for a large proportion of all fires, and pose the greatest threats. This database can aid managers in determining wildfire risks in space and in time. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

AB Aim Despite small and transient populations, early Maori transformed large areas of New Zealand's forest landscapes. We sought to isolate the biophysical predictors that explain forest loss in the pre-historic (i.e. pre-European) period in New Zealand. Location New Zealand. Methods We used resampled boosted regression trees to isolate the key predictors of forest loss from a suite of 19 topographic, climatic, soil-related and archaeological predictors at a 1-km spatial resolution across New Zealand. Results The key predictors of fire-driven forest loss during New Zealand's pre-history relate to moisture and elevation gradients, with sites characterized by low moisture levels and gentle slopes being most vulnerable. Proxies for human activity were important in the North Island, where Maori population densities were higher, but not the South Island. The predicted pattern of forest loss and its relationship with biophysical variables suggest that early Maori neither deliberately protected fire-prone regions nor systematically burnt less fire-prone ones. Main conclusions Before Maori settlement of New Zealand fire was naturally rare, despite biophysical conditions being conducive to fire spread. The introduction of an ignition source by humans made widespread forest loss inevitable, even in the absence of sustained and deliberate use of fire. Rapid forest loss at the time of human settlement is recurrent across eastern Polynesia, so understanding this dynamic in New Zealand has implications for the region as a whole.

AB Among chelicerates, Hox gene expression has only been investigated in representatives of two arachnid orders to date: Acari (mites and ticks) and Araneae (spiders). Limited data are available for the primitive arachnid orders, such as Scorpiones (scorpions) and Opiliones (harvestmen). Here, we present the first data on Hox gene expression in the harvestman Phalangium opilio. Ten Hox genes of this species were obtained from a de novo assembled developmental transcriptome using the Illumina GAII platform. All 10 genes are expressed in characteristic Hox-like expression patterns, and the expression of the anterior and central Hox genes is similar to those of other chelicerates. However, intriguingly, the three posteriormost genesUltrabithorax, abdominal-A, and Abdominal-Bshare an identical anterior expression boundary in the second opisthosomal segment, and their expression domains extend through the opisthosoma to the posterior growth zone. The overlap in expression domains of the posterior Hox genes is correlated with the absence of opisthosomal organs posterior to the tubular tracheae, which occur on the second opisthosomal segment. Together with the staggered profile of posterior Hox genes in spiders, these data suggest the involvement of abdominal-A and Abdominal-B in the evolution of heteronomous patterning of the chelicerate opisthosoma, providing a mechanism that helps explain the morphological diversity of chelicerates.

AB Background: If the geographical displacement of one species by another is accompanied by hybridization, mitochondrial DNA can introgress asymmetrically, from the outcompeted species into the invading species, over a large area. We explore this phenomenon using the two parapatric crested newt species, Triturus macedonicus and T. karelinii, distributed on the Balkan Peninsula in south-eastern Europe, as a model.
   Results: We first delimit a ca. 54,000 km(2) area in which T. macedonicus contains T. karelinii mitochondrial DNA. This introgression zone bisects the range of T. karelinii, cutting off a T. karelinii enclave. The high similarity of introgressed mitochondrial DNA haplotypes with those found in T. karelinii suggests a recent transfer across the species boundary. We then use ecological niche modeling to explore habitat suitability of the location of the present day introgression zone under current, mid-Holocene and Last Glacial Maximum conditions. This area was inhospitable during the Last Glacial Maximum for both species, but would have been habitable at the mid-Holocene. Since the mid-Holocene, habitat suitability generally increased for T. macedonicus, whereas it decreased for T. karelinii.
   Conclusion: The presence of a T. karelinii enclave suggests that T. karelinii was the first to colonize the area where the present day introgression zone is positioned after the Last Glacial Maximum. Subsequently, we propose T. karelinii was outcompeted by T. macedonicus, which captured T. karelinii mitochondrial DNA via introgressive hybridization in the process. Ecological niche modeling suggests that this replacement was likely facilitated by a shift in climate since the mid-Holocene. We suggest that the northwestern part of the current introgression zone was probably never inhabited by T. karelinii itself, and that T. karelinii mitochondrial DNA spread there through T. macedonicus exclusively. Considering the spatial distribution of the introgressed mitochondrial DNA and the signal derived from ecological niche modeling, we do not favor the hypothesis that foreign mitochondrial DNA was pulled into the T. macedonicus range by natural selection.

AB The aim of this study is on the one hand to identify the most determining variables predicting the site productivity of pedunculate oak, common beech and Scots pine in temperate lowland forests of Flanders; and on the other hand to test whether the accuracy of site productivity models based exclusively on soil or forest floor predictor variables is similar to the accuracy achieved by full ecosystem models, combining all soil, vegetation, humus and litterfall composition related variables.
   Boosted Regression Trees (BRT) were used to model in a climatically homogeneous region the relationship between environmental variables and site productivity. A distinction was made between soil (soil physical and chemical), forest floor (vegetation and humus) and ecosystem (soil, forest floor and litterfall composition jointly) predictors.
   Our results have illustrated the strength of BRT to model the non-linear behaviour of ecological processes. The ecosystem models, based on all collected variables, explained most of the variability and were more accurate than those limited to either soil or forest floor variables. Nevertheless, both the soil and forest floor models can serve as good predictive models for many forest management practices.
   Soil granulometric fractions and litterfall nitrogen concentrations were the most effective predictors of forest site productivity in Flanders. Although many studies revealed a fertilising effect of increased nitrogen deposition, nitrogen saturation seemed to reduce species' productivity in this region.

ID ECONOMIC VALUATION; RESILIENCE; VULNERABILITY; BIODIVERSITY
AB The extent to which ecosystem services have been considered in the National Adaptation Programmes of Action (NAPAs) and the proposed adaptation projects is assessed. By August 2010, 44 least developed countries had prepared their NAPAs in response to climate change. The NAPAs constitute a starting point for planning adaptation nationally and sub-nationally, but need to be evaluated and improved as new knowledge emerges. Ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA) is an emerging approach that recognizes that ecosystem services play an important role in reducing people's vulnerability to climate change. The importance of ecosystem services is acknowledged in more than 50% of the NAPAs. Approximately 22% of the proposed projects include ecosystem activities for social well-being or adaptation, with most of them in support of other adaptation measures (e.g. infrastructure). These projects deal mainly with regulating services (soil rehabilitation, erosion control and water regulation) and provisioning services (food, fibre and fuel wood). They also have the potential to promote integrative and cross-sectoral adaptation, as many of them consider multiple ecosystem services and beneficiary sectors. However, more technical, political and financial support is needed to foster the role of ecosystem services in adaptation.

AB Few data are available describing the photosynthetic parameters of the leaves of tropical montane cloud forests (TMCF). Here, we present a study of photosynthetic leaf traits (V (cmax) and J (max)), foliar dark respiration (R (d)), foliar nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P), and leaf mass per area (LMA) throughout the canopy for five different TMCF species at 3025 m a.s.l. in Andean Peru. All leaf traits showed a significant relationship with canopy height when expressed on an area basis, and V (cmax-area) and J (max-area) almost halved when descending through the TMCF canopy. When corrected to a common temperature, average V (cmax) and J (max) on a leaf area basis were similar to lowland tropical values, but lower when expressed on a mass basis, because of the higher TMCF LMA values. By contrast, R (d) on an area basis was higher than found in tropical lowland forests at a common temperature, and similar to lowland forests on a mass basis. The TMCF J (max)-V (cmax) relationship was steeper than in other tropical biomes, and we propose that this can be explained by either the light conditions or the relatively low VPD in the studied TMCF. Furthermore, V (cmax) had a significant-though relatively weak and shallow-relationship with N on an area basis, but not with P, which is consistent with the general hypothesis that TMCFs are N rather than P limited. Finally, the observed V (cmax)-N relationship (i.e., maximum photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency) was distinctly different from those in tropical and temperate regions, probably because the TMCF leaves compensate for reduced Rubisco activity in cool environments.

AB The changes in a marine community in the northern Adriatic Sea were explored over a period of 65 years using landings data from a commercial fishing fleet, and the role of fishing pressure and environmental variations in driving these changes was investigated. A total of 40 taxonomic categories, including one or several species, were analysed, representing 93.7% of the total landings. From 1945 to 2010 a significant decrease in the evenness index was observed, indicating a trend towards landings dominated by fewer taxa. The composition of the landings showed a temporal shift during the 1980s; from 1945 to the 1980s a continuous, clear change in composition took place, probably driven by an increase in fishing pressure as well as riverine nutrient inputs. Since the 1980s, a different trend of changing composition emerged. Among the analysed predictors, fishing capacity, summer seawater temperature, inflow from the Po River (the major river of the northern Adriatic Sea) and nutrients were related to the changes in landings. In relation to life-history traits of the landed species, the community shifted from large, late-maturing species to more fecund, smaller and earlier-maturing species. A high fishing pressure is probably the major cause of these changes, possibly acting synergistically with environmental variations.

AB Selected shorelines and offshore shoals in Lakes Erie, Huron and Ontario were surveyed with a high frequency hydroacoustic system to investigate current spatial patterns of nuisance benthic filamentous algal (e.g., Cladophora) cover and stand height. Cladophora reached nuisance levels at all sites in Lakes Erie and Ontario, but not in Lake Huron or Georgian Bay. Despite clear gradients in coastal land cover, near shore water quality gradients were generally weak, and for Lakes Erie and Ontario, measures of near shore water quality were similar to that at offshore shoals. Hierarchical partitioning analysis suggested that while dreissenid mussel abundance appeared to be important in determining the magnitude of Cladophora standing crop, the joint contribution of catchment land cover, near shore water quality (nutrient levels and suspended matter) and dreissenid mussel abundance explained nearly 95% of the total variance in nuisance Cladophora standing crop observed in this study. Although the results from this study are necessarily correlative in nature and definition of causal relationships is not possible, these results provide corroborating evidence from sites across a gradient within and across the lower Great Lakes that is consistent with the operation of the near shore shunt model.

AB Despite the central importance of the niche concept for the ecological theory, current methods to quantify the species niche from qualitative resources, such as food or habitat types, remain insufficiently developed. Classically, information theory and diversity measures have formed the toolbox used for calculating resource niche metrics on species preference data for a set of qualitative resources. We provide a comprehensive framework that extends these classical approaches by incorporating the resemblance between resources into the calculation of resource niche metrics. This does not only allow estimation of the niche centre, breadth, overlap and displacement with greater accuracy, but also makes the estimates less influenced by the way the resources are subdivided. In addition, all niche metrics can be calculated while taking into account the variation in resource availability, and confidence intervals can be obtained by bootstrapping. We illustrate the utility of the framework with an analysis of dietary preferences in feral pigeons Columba livia.

AB Diagnostic carbon cycle models depend on parameterization to establish model sensitivity to climate variables and site factors. Here we acquired meteorological and carbon flux data from a diverse set (N = 18) of eddy covariance (EC) flux towers, along with MODIS data on FPAR (the fraction of incident photosynthetically active radiation that is absorbed by the plant canopy) at the sites, and used the data to develop a parameter set for the application of a diagnostic carbon cycle model over North America. The parameter optimization approach relied on goodness of fit between model simulations and tower estimates of gross primary production and net ecosystem production (NEP). Parameters such as light use efficiency CLUE) and base rate of heterotrophic respiration varied widely between sites representing different plant functional types (PFTs), thus supporting the value of stratification by PFT when parameterizing the model. Where multiple EC sites were available within a PFT, overall prediction error and bias in mean NEP was reduced by cross-site optimization as opposed to reliance on a single site. Optimization with the MODIS Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) instead of MODIS FPAR resulted in a similar goodness of fit, however, LUE values were pushed to levels that were not physiologically realistic when using EVI. The increasing availability of gap-filled EC tower data is rapidly improving the opportunities for direct coupling of satellite and ground observational data for parameterizing of diagnostic carbon flux models.

AB The Asian cyprinid fish, the topmouth gudgeon (Pseudorasbora parva), was introduced into Europe in the 1960s. A highly invasive freshwater fish, it is currently found in at least 32 countries outside its native range. Here we analyse a 700 base pair fragment of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene to examine different models of colonisation and spread within the invasive range, and to investigate the factors that may have contributed to their invasion success. Haplotype and nucleotide diversity of the introduced populations from continental Europe was higher than that of the native populations, although two recently introduced populations from the British Isles showed low levels of variability. Based on coalescent theory, all introduced and some native populations showed a relative excess of nucleotide diversity compared to haplotype diversity. This suggests that these populations are not in mutation-drift equilibrium, but rather that the relative inflated level of nucleotide diversity is consistent with recent admixture. This study elucidates the colonisation patterns of P. parva in Europe and provides an evolutionary framework of their invasion. It supports the hypothesis that their European colonisation was initiated by their introduction to a single location or small geographic area with subsequent complex pattern of spread including both long distance and stepping-stone dispersal. Furthermore, it was preceded by, or associated with, the admixture of genetically diverse source populations that may have augmented its invasive-potential.

AB The Shiner Perch (Cymatogaster aggregata Gibbons) exhibits a viviparous reproductive mode and long-term female sperm storage, two biological features that may predispose this fish species for both intense sperm competition and frequent multiple paternity within broods. To test these hypotheses, we used polymorphic microsatellite markers to identify sires and quantify paternal contributions to the progeny arrays of 27 pregnant females from a natural population of C. aggregata. The number of sires per brood ranged from one to eight (mean 4.6), typically with skewed distributions of fertilization success by the fathers but no correlation between sire number and brood size. The extraordinarily high incidences of multiple paternity in this species probably are due in part to high rates of mate encounter, but selection pressures related to the avoidance of maternal fetal incompatibility may further have promoted the evolution of polyandrous mating behaviors in this female-pregnant species. Our genetic data are consistent with the hypothesis that viviparity, long-term sperm storage, and extreme polyandry are interrelated reproductive phenomena that should promote the evolution of post-copulatory sperm competition and/or cryptic female choice in these fishes.

AB Little is known of how changes in plant function may influence adaptive traits amongst animals further up the food chain. We addressed the hypothesis that shifts in plant functional traits are associated with the adaptive function of animal species which have an indirect trophic link. We compared community characteristics and functional traits of two trophically detached biotic groups (vascular plants and carabid beetles) along a primary succession on terrain at the Cedec glacier in the Alps, where deglaciation events following post-Little Ice Age climate warmings are marked by moraine ridges. Morphofunctional traits were recorded: canopy height (CH), leaf dry matter content (LDMC), leaf dry weight (LDW) and specific leaf area (SLA) (for plants) and the number of brachypterous, autumn-breeding and predator species, and average body length (for carabid beetles). We found that vegetation cover and plant species richness gradually increased throughout early succession, with an abrupt increase between 40 and 150 years after deglaciation. At the early stages of the succession plant traits were typical of ruderal species (high SLA, low CH, LDW) whilst a shift in traits towards stress-tolerance (low SLA) occurred >150 years. Carabid communities and traits changed alongside changes in plant species richness and cover, with late successional vegetation hosting larger, more diverse, less mobile carabid species with longer larval development. Thus, ruderal plant strategies are the main contributors during vegetation development, determining vegetation quantity, and probably have the greatest impact on changes in carabid assemblages by regulating resource availability. Plants then require greater stress-tolerance to survive in stable vegetation, which supports high carabid diversity. This suggests that different plant strategies may affect ground beetle communities via contrasting mechanisms: both quantities (biomass, species richness) and qualities (functional traits, adaptive strategies) should be taken into account during studies of plant-animal interactions within ecosystems.

AB Rodents of the Praomys daltoni complex are typical inhabitants of the Sudanian savanna ecosystem in western Africa and represent a suitable model for testing the effects of Quaternary climatic oscillations on extant genetic variation patterns. Phylogeographical analyses of mitochondrial DNA sequences (cytochrome b) across the distribution range of the complex revealed several well-defined clades that do not support the division of the clade into the two species currently recognized on the basis of morphology, i.e. P. daltoni (Thomas, 1892) and Praomys derooi (Van der Straeten & Verheyen 1978). The observed genetic structure fits the refuge hypothesis, suggesting that only a small number of populations repeatedly survived in distinct forest-savanna mosaic blocks during the arid phases of the Pleistocene, and then expanded again during moister periods. West African rivers may also have contributed to genetic differentiation, especially by forming barriers after secondary contact of expanding populations. The combination of three types of genetic markers (mtDNA sequences, microsatellite loci, cytogenetic data) provides evidence for the presence of up to three lineages, which most probably represent distinct biological species. Furthermore, incongruence between nuclear and mtDNA markers in some individuals unambiguously points towards a past introgression event. Our results highlight the importance of combining different molecular markers for an accurate interpretation of genetic data.

AB In this article, we attempt to estimate the contemporary phytoplankton species pool of a particular lake, by assessing the rate of floral change over a period of 15 years. Phytoplankton time series data from Lake Stechlin, an oligo-mesotrophic lake in the Baltic Lake District (Germany) were used. Of the 254 algal species recorded during the 15-year of studies with roughly biweekly sampling, 212 species were planktonic. In the individual plankton years, the recorded total number of species changed between 97 and 122, of which the number of dominants (> 1% contribution to the annual average of total biomass) was only 10-19. The 15-year cumulative number of species exhibited an almost linear increase after an initial saturation phase. This increase was attributed to two reasons: increase of sample size and immigration of species new to the flora. Based on a probabilistic model developed in this study, we estimated the number of co-existing planktonic species of the lake as some 180, and the rate of floral change as 1-2 species per year. Of these co-existing species, only few maintain the matter-energy processing ecosystem functions in any particular plankton year. Selection of these dominants is probably driven by mesoclimatic cycles, coupled with human-induced forcing, like eutrophication. All others are hiding as an ecological memory, in the sense of the capacity or experiences of past states to influence present or future responses of the community. Data analyses suggest that selection of the 'memory species' that show temporary abundance increases over shorter (several years) periods are largely dependent upon the dominants. These results show that interspecific interactions and the particular autecological features of the dominants, together with their effects on the whole ecosystem, act as a major organizing force. Some phytoplankton species, like Planktothrix rubescens, are efficient ecosystem engineers with cascading effects of both a top-down and bottom-up nature. Historical scientific data on Planktothrix blooms in Lake Stechlin suggest cyclic patterns in long-term development of phytoplankton which, as the legend of the Red Cock suggests, dates back much further than scientific archives.

AB Population genetics investigates the distribution of genetic variation in natural populations and the genetic differentiation among populations. Lichen-forming fungi are exciting subjects for population genetic studies due to their obligate symbiosis with a green-algal and/or cyanobacterial photobiont, and because their different reproductive strategies could influence fungal genetic structures in various ways. In this review, first, I briefly summarize the results from studies of chemotype variation in populations of lichen-forming fungi. Second, I compare and evaluate the DNA-based molecular tools available for population genetics of lichen-forming fungi. Third, I review the literature available on the genetic structure of lichen fungi to show general trends. I discuss some fascinating examples, and point out directions for future research.

AB The use of Jatropha curcas oil as a source of biofuel has been well-explored. However, the physiological and growth studies of J. curcas have received considerably lesser attention. In this study, leaf gas exchange measurements and leaf nitrogen content were determined for four varieties of J. curcas, grown in the field or in pots. Based on stable carbon isotope analysis (delta(13)C) and gas-exchange studies, J. curcas is a C(3) sun plant and the range of leaf photosynthetic rates (or CO(2) assimilation rates, P (Nmax)) were typically between 7 and 25 mu mol(CO(2)) m(-2) s(-1) and light saturation generally occurred beyond 800 mu mol(quanta) m(-2) s(-1). Higher rates of leaf photosynthesis were generally obtained with the mature leaves. In addition, increased foliar P (Nmax) were recorded in potted J. curcas variety Indiana with increasing nitrogen (N) nutrition levels. These plants also showed greater growth, increased leaf N content, higher maximum CO(2) assimilation capacity (P (NhighCO2)) and chlorophyll (Chl) content, indicating the potential of optimizing the growth of Jatropha by varying fertilizer nutrient levels. A rapid assessment for leaf N using a nondestructive and portable Chl meter had been established for J. curcas. This approach will allow repeated sampling of the same plant over time and thus enable the monitoring of the appropriate levels of soil fertility to achieve good Jatropha plantation productivity. High N nutrition improved the overall plant oil yield by increasing the total number of fruits/seeds produced per plant, while not affecting the intrinsic seed oil content.

AB Eurasian otter populations strongly declined and partially disappeared due to global and local causes (habitat destruction, water pollution, human persecution) in parts of their continental range. Conservation strategies, based on reintroduction projects or restoration of dispersal corridors, should rely on sound knowledge of the historical or recent consequences of population genetic structuring. Here we present the results of a survey performed on 616 samples, collected from 19 European countries, genotyped at the mtDNA control-region and 11 autosomal microsatellites. The mtDNA variability was low (nucleotide diversity = 0.0014; average number of pairwise differences = 2.25), suggesting that extant otter mtDNA lineages originated recently. A star-shaped mtDNA network did not allow outlining any phylogeographic inference. Microsatellites were only moderately variable (H (o) = 0.50; H (e) = 0.58, on average across populations), the average allele number was low (observed A (o) = 4.9, range 2.5-6.8; effective A (e) = 2.8; range 1.6-3.7), suggesting small historical effective population size. Extant otters likely originated from the expansion of a single refugial population. Bayesian clustering and landscape genetic analyses however indicate that local populations are genetically differentiated, perhaps as consequence of post-glacial demographic fluctuations and recent isolation. These results delineate a framework that should be used for implementing conservation programs in Europe, particularly if they are based on the reintroduction of wild or captive-reproduced otters.

AB Hitchhiker organisms have been known since the earliest days of international travel, but changes in global trade mean that there are more now than ever before. They include a number of serious invasive species and are among the most difficult of quarantine problems to manage Invasive animals transported as hitchhikers, other than plant pests, fall largely outside the international frameworks for biosecurity risk analysis However, this is not necessarily a barrier to either risk analysis or effective management While there are a number of challenges in managing hitchhiker organisms, the risk analysis tools that are needed already exist. However, opening up access to appropriate information, increasing international cooperation and developing new biosecurity treatments suitable for large-volume pathways will enable significant improvements.

   RESPONSES
AB Effects of salinity and nutrients on carbon gain in relation to water use were studied in the grey mangrove, Avicennia marina, growing along a natural salinity gradient in south-eastern Australia. Tall trees characterized areas of seawater salinities (fringe zone) and stunted trees dominated landward hypersaline areas (scrub zone). Trees were fertilized with nitrogen (+N) or phosphorus (+P) or unfertilized. There was no significant effect of +P on shoot growth, whereas +N enhanced canopy development, particularly in scrub trees. Scrub trees maintained greater CO2 assimilation per unit water transpired (water-use efficiency, WUE) and had lower nitrogen-use efficiency (NUE; CO2 assimilation rate per unit leaf nitrogen) than fringe trees. The CO2 assimilation rates of +N trees were similar to those in other treatments, but were achieved at lower transpiration rates, stomatal conductance and intercellular CO2 concentrations. Maintaining comparable assimilation rates at lower stomatal conductance requires greater ribulose 1 center dot 5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase activity, consistent with greater N content per unit leaf area in +N trees. Hence, +N enhanced WUE at the expense of NUE. Instantaneous WUE estimates were supported by less negative foliar delta 13C values for +N trees and scrub control trees. Thus, nutrient enrichment may alter the structure and function of mangrove forests along salinity gradients.

AB This article summarizes the outcomes of the 15th Workshop of the International Association for Phytoplankton Taxonomy and Ecology. Four major issues dealing with the role of physical factors in phytoplankton ecology were addressed in the articles of this special volume: global change and its likely impacts on phytoplankton, the role of physical factors in the autecology of particular species, impacts on the inocula for the following years, and the role of light in shaping phytoplankton dynamics. Case studies from different types of aquatic environments (rivers, deep and shallow lakes, floodplain lakes, wetlands, oxbows, and even the deep ocean) and from diverse geographical locations (not only from the Mediterranean and temperate regions, but also from subtropical and tropical ones) have shown that physical forcing exerts a variety of selective pressures with impacts ranging from molding shape and size of organisms to modifying, through cascade effects, the structure of whole ecosystems.

AB The effects of plant diversity on ecosystem functioning have been mainly studied for fast growing systems such as grassland. These studies have stressed the context dependence of aboveground and belowground relationships (e.g. soil fertility, field vegetation or soil biota). Over the last few years, with the growing need for indicators for sustainable forest management, there has been a considerable increase in studies on AG-BG relationships within forest ecosystems. Nevertheless, given the specific characteristics of forest systems (long-term dynamics, the single tree effect) our mechanistic understanding of these relationships remains poor.
   We thus assessed the effects of litter composition on litter disappearance rates and nitrogen release with a field litterbag experiment within a pure forest stand and a mixed one, over 1 year. We aimed at (i) characterising the magnitude and the direction of the litter composition effects, (ii) determining which soil biota group mediates the litter manipulation effects and (iii) quantifying the influence of field vegetation on both litter manipulation effects and soil biota activity. Litter mixtures were made with two groups of temperate tree species with contrasting litter quality: Fagus sylvatica and Quercus petraea with poor litter quality and Carpinus betulus, Prunus avium, Acer pseudoplatanus with good litter quality. Three types of litterbag with different mesh sizes (0.175 mm, 2 mm and 10 mm), filled with 10 g of five different leaf litters, were used to assess the contribution of the microbiota (microflora + microfauna), mesofauna and macrofauna to the processes measured.
   We found that litter disappearance rates and nitrogen release depend more on the functional characteristics of the component litter species (litter quality) than on their number, and on the functional characteristics of the dominant species rather than on their number. These results were mainly due to microbiota activity. Field vegetation only influenced nitrogen release for bags filled with 100% hombeam. In this study we thus examine our results in the light of contradictory outcomes from the literature, and discuss methodological aspects of litter diversity experiments with regard to forest ecosystem specificity.

AB To model the impact of grazing on the growth of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), we measured photosynthesis in the field. Grazing may affect photosynthesis as a consequence of changes to leaf water status, nitrogen content per unit leaf area (N(a)) or photosynthetic enzyme activity. While light-saturated CO(2) assimilation rates (A(sat)) of field-grown wheat were unchanged during grazing, A(sat) transiently increased by 33-68% compared with ungrazed leaves over a 2- to 4-week period after grazing ended. Grazing reduced leaf mass per unit area, increased stomatal conductance and increased intercellular CO(2) concentrations (C(i)) by 36-38%, 88-169% and 17-20%, respectively. Grazing did not alter N(a). Using a photosynthesis model, we demonstrated that the increase in A(sat) after grazing required an increase in Rubisco activity of up to 53%, whereas the increase in C(i) could only increase A(sat) by up to 13%. Increased Rubisco activity was associated with a partial alleviation of leaf water stress. We observed a 68% increase in leaf water potential of grazed plants that could be attributed to reduced leaf area index and canopy evaporative demand, as well as to increased rainfall infiltration into soil. The grazing of rain-fed grain cereals may be tailored to relieve plant water stress and enhance leaf photosynthesis.

AB High-latitude species are predicted to be vulnerable to climate change, particularly in the UK uplands, where many are at the margins of their southern range. There is increasing evidence that climate change may have an impact on populations through reductions in prey abundance. The diet of 17 insectivorous UK upland birds, and the sensitivity of their prey to likely climate change, were quantified from the literature and combined to produce an index of climate-change sensitivity for upland birds. Coleoptera and Diptera were the 2 most important prey taxa, with Tipulidae the most widely ingested prey family. Lepidoptera, Lumbricidae and Hymenoptera also comprised >20% of the diet of at least one upland bird species. Of these prey taxa, existing studies suggest that Tipulidae, Chironomidae and Lumbridicae may be particularly vulnerable to rising temperatures and increased frequency of drought projected to result from climate change. Therefore, the contribution of these 3 taxa to the diets of upland birds provides an index of climate-change sensitivity, which was correlated with an index of recent upland bird population trends. Future increases in temperature and drought frequency are expected to have an impact on populations of a range of upland bird species through reductions in prey availability, although further studies are required to test this hypothesis. Many upland areas have been artificially drained using ditches. Blocking these ditches may therefore provide a potential management option for climate-change adaptation in the UK uplands.

AB A field experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of alternate irrigation ( AI) on root distribution and yield of wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.)/maize (Zea mays L.) intercropping system during the period of 2007-2009 in an oasis of arid north-west China. Five treatments, i.e. sole wheat with conventional irrigation ( W), sole maize with alternate irrigation ( AM), sole maize with conventional irrigation ( CM), wheat/maize intercropping with alternate irrigation (AW/M), and wheat/maize intercropping with conventional irrigation (CW/M). The results showed that root growth was significantly enhanced by alternate irrigation ( AI), root weight density (RWD), root length density (RLD) and root-shoot ratios (R/S) in AI treatments were all higher than those in conventional irrigation (CI) treatments. Moreover, intercropped wheat and maize also had a greater root development at a majority of soil depths than wheat and maize in monoculture. In three years, AW/M always achieved the highest total seed yield under different treatments. Higher yield and reduced irrigation resulted in higher water use efficiency (WUE) for the AW/M treatment. Our results suggest that AI should be a useful water-saving irrigation method on wheat/maize intercropping in arid oasis field where intercropping planting is decreased because of limited water resource.

AB There is currently a critical knowledge gap in how eutrophication and climate variables separately and interactively impact the dynamics of marine ecosystems. Based on long-term monitoring data we quantified the separate and combined impacts of nutrient loading, temperature, salinity, and wind conditions on zooplankton, zoobenthos and fish inhabiting a brackish water ecosystem in the Gulf of Riga. Changes in zoobenthos communities and herring stock were largely explained by climate variables. Zooplankton species were related to both eutrophication and climate variables, and models combining all environmental variables explained additional variation in zooplankton data compared to the separate models of climate and eutrophication. This suggests that zoobenthos communities and herring stock are largely driven by weather conditions, whereas the combined effect of weather and nutrient loads are likely the cause for dynamic zooplankton communities in the Gulf of Riga.

AB Effective population size (N-e) is a central evolutionary concept, but its genetic estimation can be significantly complicated by age Structure. Here we investigate N-e in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) populations that have undergone changes in demography and population dynamics, applying four different genetic estimators. For this purpose we use genetic data (14 microsatellite markers) from archived scale samples collected between 1951 and 2004. Through life table simulations we assess the genetic consequences of life history variation on N-e. Although variation in reproductive contribution by mature parr affects age Structure, we find that its effect on N-e estimation may be relatively minor. A comparison of estimator models suggests that even low iteroparity may upwardly bias N-e estimates when ignored (semelparity assumed) and should thus empirically be accounted for. Our results indicate that N-e may have changed over time in relatively small populations, but otherwise remained stable. Our ability to detect changes in N-e in larger populations was, however, likely hindered by sampling limitations. An evaluation of N-e estimates in a demographic context suggests that life history diversity, density-dependent. factors, and metapopulation dynamics may all affect the genetic stability of these Populations.

AB 1. While great effort has been made in documenting the processes that drive plant-induced susceptibility after herbivore attack and it is widely accepted that herbivores can facilitate plant diseases, the relative importance of this interaction in controlling plant growth in natural systems remains largely unexplored.
   2. In south-western Atlantic salt marshes, we investigated the importance of disease after herbivory by examining: (i) whether or not a herbivorous crab facilitates disease (i.e. fungus infection) in marsh plants (Spartina alterniflora and S. densiflora) when clipping off small portions of leaves and (ii) the separate and interactive effects of crab grazing but fungal infection in controlling marsh plant growth.
   3. Our results show that crab grazing facilitates fungal infection in Spartina leaves. A factorial field experiment shows that both direct crab herbivory and fungal infection strongly suppress plant production (by more than 50%).
   4. Synthesis. These experimental results demonstrate that fungal infection following herbivory attack can decrease salt marsh plant production and that increased disease susceptibility can be a fundamental factor in controlling plant production in natural ecosystems, even in cases where herbivores do not directly inoculate the pathogen but only damage plant tissue.

AB Aim To test whether the onset of spring growth in European shrublands is advanced in response to the warmer conditions projected for the next two decades by climate models, and, if there is a change, whether it differs across Europe.
   Location The studied sites spanned a broad north-south European gradient with average annual temperatures (8.2-15.6 degrees C) and precipitation (511-1427 mm).
   Methods 'Bud break' was monitored in eight shrub and grass species in six European sites under control and experimentally warmer conditions generated by automatic roofs covering vegetation during the night.
   Results Species responsive to increased temperatures were Vaccinium myrtillus and Empetrum nigrum in Wales, Deschampsia flexuosa in Denmark, Calluna vulgaris in Netherlands, Populus alba in Hungary and Erica multiflora in Spain. Although the acceleration of spring growth was the commonest response to warming treatments, the responses at each site were species specific and year dependent. Under experimental warming 25% of cases exhibited a significantly earlier onset of the growing season and 10% had a significantly delayed onset of vegetative growth. No geographical gradient was detected in the experimental warming effects. However, there was a trend towards a greater dominance of phenological advances with more intense the warming treatments. Above 0.8 degrees C warming, only advancements were recorded.
   Main conclusions Our results show that warmer temperatures projected for the next decades have substantial potential effects on the phenology of the spring growth of dominant species in different European shrublands, with a dominant trend towards advancements the more intense the warming is. However, our study also demonstrates the overall difficulties of applying simple predictive relationships to extrapolate the effects of global change on phenology. Various combinations of environmental factors occur concurrently at different European sites and the interactions between different drivers (e. g. water and chilling) can alter phenology significantly.

AB The importance of local hydraulic conditions on the structuring of freshwater biotic communities is widely recognized by the scientific community. In spite of this, most current methods based upon invertebrates do not take this factor into account in their assessment of ecological quality. The aim of this paper is to investigate the influence of local hydraulic conditions on invertebrate community metrics and to estimate their potential weight in the evaluation of river water quality. The dataset used consisted of 130 stream sites located in four broad European geographical contexts: Alps, Central mountains, Mediterranean mountains anti Lowland streams. Using River Habitat Survey data, the river hydromorphology was evaluated by means of the Lentic-lotic River Descriptor and the Habitat Modification Score. To quantify the level of water pollution, a synoptic Organic Pollution Descriptor was calculated. For their established, wide applicability, STAR Intercalibration Common Metrics and index were selected as biological quality indices. Significant relationships between selected environmental variables and biological metrics devoted to the evaluation of ecological quality were obtained by means of Partial Least Squares regression analysis. The lentic-lotic character was the most significant factor affecting invertebrate communities in the Mediterranean mountains, even if it is a relevant factor for most quality metrics also in the Alpine and Central mountain rivers. Therefore, this character should be taken into account when assessing ecological quality of rivers because it can greatly affect the assignment of ecological status.

AB Habitat destruction and fragmentation, interactions with introduced species or the relocation of animals to form new populations for conservation purposes may result in a multiplication of population bottlenecks. Examples are the translocations of koalas to French Island and its derivative Kangaroo Island population, with both populations established as insurance policies against koala extinction. In terms of population size, these conservation programs were success stories. However, the genetic story could be different. We conducted a genetic investigation of French and Kangaroo Island koalas by using 15 microsatellite markers, 11 of which are described here for the first time. The results confirm very low genetic diversity. French Island koalas have 3.8 alleles per locus and Kangaroo Island koalas 2.4. The present study found a 19% incidence of testicular abnormality in Kangaroo Island animals. Internal relatedness, an individual inbreeding coefficient, was not significantly different in koalas with testicular abnormalities from that in other males, suggesting the condition is not related to recent inbreeding. It could instead result from an unfortunate selection of founder individuals carrying alleles for testicular abnormalities, followed by a subsequent increase in these alleles' frequencies through genetic drift and small population-related inefficiency of selection. Given the low diversity and possible high prevalence of deleterious alleles, the genetic viability of the population remains uncertain, despite its exponential growth so far. This stands as a warning to other introductions for conservation reasons.

AB Several recent studies have investigated the use of the conservation planning software Marxan to design Marine Protected Area (MPA) networks in UK waters. The systematic conservation planning approach embodied by Marxan has a number of advantages, but these studies have highlighted the need for guidance and advice on best practice. Here, we discuss two broad topics that we feel should inform future developments in the UK and elsewhere in the European Union. First, several technical issues need to be addressed to ensure the scientific defensibility of any conservation planning project. These include identifying which conservation features should be represented in an MPA system, developing a system for setting representation targets, and identifying which data should be included to minimize conflict with human uses of the sea. Second, it is necessary for researchers to engage at an early stage with those responsible for implementation and recognize that reserve selection should be part of a broader conservation planning process centred on a stakeholder-developed implementation strategy. A more-inclusive approach will make use of technical outputs, such as those generated by Marxan, as part of the process of policy development.

AB With environmental factors being spatially structured, plant traits that are related to these factors should exhibit a corresponding spatial pattern. We analyzed the distribution pattern of seed mass in Germany. We calculated the median seed mass for 10' longitude by 6' latitude grid cells across Germany using the trait databases BIOLFLOR and the plant distribution database FLORKART. To explain these distribution patterns of median seed mass, we applied multiple regression analyses on twelve selected environmental variables, accounting for spatial autocorrelation. To deal with collinearities of the predictors, we used hierarchical partitioning to analyze the independent and joint explanatory power of the environmental variables. To test whether statistical relationships are due to hidden correlations between seed mass and plant growth form, we conducted seperate analyses for annual, perennial herbs, shrubs and trees. Low median seed mass was found in the lowlands and river valleys whereas high median seed mass was typical for the rich loess regions and the calcareous mountain ranges. Seed mass exhibited a strong positive correlation with soil pH (62% of variance explained) and a negative correlation with soil moisture (25%). Light was less important as a predictor of seed mass. Within the growth forms we observed similar distribution and correlation patterns pointing to a direct link between seed mass and the environmental variables soil pH and moisture. We argue that this striking relationship with soil pH is caused by the high stress from competition on fertile calcareous sites. The negative moisture effect may be due to drought stress. Both relationships are particulary interesting for the prediction of ecosystem responses to climate and land use changes.

AB Scientific information on reef fish spawning aggregation fisheries is sparse in light of numerous regional declines and extirpations from overexploitation. Fisher interviews of the small-scale commercial mutton snapper (Lutjanus analis) spawning aggregation fishery at Gladden Spit, Belize, suggests a historic decadal decline. The reported trend is supported by analysis of inter-seasonal catch and effort and yield (2000-2002) that reveals a 59% decline in catch per unit effort (CPUE) and a 22% decrease in mean landings per boat. Declining population-level trends are also supported by a significant decrease in inter-annual median lengths of mutton snappers (2000-2006). These findings demonstrate the need for additional life history information that includes length-associated age and details on growth to provide clearer support of the effects on, and responses by, populations following fishing. In view of the historical changes to mutton snapper CPUE and landings at Gladden Spit and the fishery-associated declines in fish spawning aggregations observed globally, a precautionary approach to spawning aggregation management is warranted that provides full protection from fishing to enhance population persistence. The findings also highlight the need for substantially greater enforcement and long-term fisheries monitoring under a comprehensive regional management strategy.

AB Past work suggests that burial and low nutrient availability limit the growth and zonal distribution of coastal dune plants. Given the importance of these two factors, there is a surprising lack of field investigations of the interactions between burial and nutrient availability. This study aims to address this issue by measuring the growth responses of four coastal dune plant species to these two factors and their interaction. Species that naturally experience either high or low rates of burial were selected and a factorial burial by nutrient addition experiment was conducted. Growth characteristics were measured in order to determine which characteristics allow a species to respond to burial. Species that naturally experience high rates of burial (Arctotheca populifolia and Scaevola plumieri) displayed increased growth when buried, and this response was nutrient-limited. Stable-dune species had either small (Myrica cordifolia, N-fixer) or negligible responses to burial (Metalasia muricata), and were not nutrient-limited. This interspecific difference in response to burial and/or fertiliser is consistent with the idea that burial maintains the observed zonation of species on coastal dunes. Species that are unable to respond to burial are prevented from occupying the mobile dunes. Species able to cope with high rates of burial had high nitrogen-use efficiencies and low dry mass costs of production, explaining their ability to respond to burial under nutrient limitation. The interaction between burial and nutrient limitation is understudied but vital to understanding the zonation of coastal dune plant species.

ID UNITS
AB Population units that merit separate management and are of conservation concern have been called evolutionary significant units. Two divergent lineages of the European rabbit Oryctolagus cuniculus occur naturally in Spain, with a well-marked geographical distribution. We analysed the frequency and importance of rabbit translocations in central-southern Spain and whether this practice, carried out by hunters and conservationists, could cause the mixture of two clearly different evolutionary significant units. We carried out interviews in 1993 and 2002 at 60 locations to determine the presence and intensity of translocations during both decades. The distribution of the lineages was obtained using mtDNA analysis of hunted rabbits in 2003-2005. We demonstrate that rabbit translocation was used frequently in the 1980s and increased in the 1990s. Up to 43% of the studied areas translocated rabbits in the latter decade, whereas only 25% did so in the 1980s. Our results show that neither the origin of the introduced rabbits nor their genetic lineage were taken into account in most of the translocations. We found rabbits of lineage A in several localities within the distribution area of lineage B, and vice versa, probably as a consequence of translocations. The distribution of both lineages is likely to have been altered by human activity and this could represent the loss of the results of 2 million years of genetic differentiation with possible attendent ecological consequences. Consequently, authorities should more closely regulate rabbit translocations and convey to both hunters and conservationists the importance of not mixing the lineages by translocations.

AB Using museum specimens, we studied recent changes in skull size of the American marten Martes americana, in continental Alaska. In Alaska, global warming has resulted in milder winters that may contribute to an improved food supply in the wild. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that body size of the marten had increased during the second half of the 20th century, in response to global warming. We found that skull size, and by implication body size, increased significantly during the second half of the 20th century, possibly due to an improved food supply and/or lower metabolic demands in winter. Improved food availability in winter may result from the improved nutritional conditions for prey, and/or from increased access to prey resulting from a longer snow-free season. Longitude had a significant positive effect on skull size and a significant negative effect on teeth size. In Alaska, the climate is milder along the western coast and becomes harsher inland. Hence, the milder climate was associated with larger body size providing further support for our prediction that body size of the American marten was influenced by food availability and reduced energy expenditure. The negative relationship between longitude and teeth size may indicate a trend towards a larger prey in inland marten populations, but we have no data to support or refute this hypothesis.

AB Phylogenetic and geographic evidence suggest that many parthenogenetic organisms have evolved recently and have spread rapidly. These patterns play a critical role in our understanding of the relative merits of sexual versus asexual reproductive modes, yet their interpretation is often hampered by a lack of detail. Here we present a detailed phylogeographic study of a vertebrate parthenogen, the Australian gecko Heteronotia binoei, in combination with statistical and biophysical modeling of its distribution during the last glacial maximum. Parthenogenetic H. binoei occur in the Australian arid zone and have the widest range of any known vertebrate parthenogen. They are broadly sympatric with their sexual counterparts, from which they arose via hybridization. We have applied nested clade phylogeographic, effective migration, and mismatch distribution analyses to mitochondrial DNA ( mtDNA) sequences obtained for 319 individuals sampled throughout the known geographic ranges of two parthenogenetic mitochondrial lineages. These analyses provide strong evidence for past range expansion events from west to east across the arid zone, and for continuing eastward range expansion. Parthenogen formation and range expansion events date to the late Pleistocene, with one lineage expanding from the northwest of its present range around 240,000 years ago and the second lineage expanding from the far west around 70,000 years ago. Statistical and biophysical distribution models support these inferences of recent range expansion, with suitable climatic conditions during the last glacial maximum most likely limited to parts of the arid zone north and west of much of the current ranges of these lineages. Combination of phylogeographic analyses and distribution modeling allowed considerably stronger inferences of the history of this complex than either would in isolation, illustrating the power of combining complementary analytical approaches.

AB Both habitat heterogeneity and disturbance can profoundly influence ecological systems at many levels of biological and ecological organization. However, the joint influences of heterogeneity and disturbance on temporal variability in communities have received little attention despite the intense homogenizing influence of human activity. I performed a field manipulation of substrate heterogeneity in a small New England stream, and measured changes in benthic macroinvertebrate communities for 100 days-a period that included both a severe drought and a flood. Generally, community variability decreased with increasing substrate heterogeneity. However, within sampling intervals, this relationship tended to fluctuate through time, apparently tracking changes in hydrology. At the beginning of the experiment, community temporal variability clearly decreased along a gradient of increasing substrate heterogeneity-a result consistent with an observational study performed the previous year. During the subsequent weeks, droughts and flooding created exceptionally high variability in both hydrology and benthic macroinvertebrate community structure resulting in the disappearance of this relationship. However, during the last weeks of the experiment when hydrologic conditions were relatively more stable, the negatively sloped relationship between community temporal variability and habitat heterogeneity reemerged and mimicked relationships observed both early in the experiment and in the previous year's study. High habitat heterogeneity may promote temporal stability through several mechanisms including stabilization of resources and increased refugia from minor disturbances or predation. However, the results of this experiment suggest that severe disturbance events can create large-scale environmental variability that effectively swamps the influence of habitat heterogeneity, illustrating that a thorough understanding of community temporal variability in natural systems will necessarily consider sources of environmental variability at multiple spatial and temporal scales.

AB Similarly to other members of the Polyomaviridae family, BK virus (BKV) is thought to have co-evolved with its human host. BKV has four subtypes that are distinguishable by immunological reactivity, with two (subtypes I and IV) being most prevalent in human populations. Subtype I is the major subtype worldwide, whereas subtype IV is prevalent in East Asia and Europe but rare in Africa. The geographic distribution pattern of subtype IV BKV is in apparent disagreement with the hypothesis that BKV co-evolved with humans, since subtype IV rarely occurs in Africa. To elucidate the origin of subtype IV, 53 complete subtype IV sequences derived from East Asians and Europeans were subjected to a detailed phylogenetic analysis using the maximum-likelihood and neighbor-joining methods. We identified six subgroups (a1, a2, b1, b2, c1, and c2) that formed a tree represented by the formula: "(a1, a2), ((b1, b2), (c1, c2))." Interestingly, we found a close correlation between subtype IV subgroups and population geography; thus, all subgroups except c2 were prevalent in particular East Asian populations, with c2 occurring in both Europe and Northeast Asia. From these findings, we conclude that subtype IV of BKV now prevalent in modern humans is derived from a virus that infected ancestral Asians. We introduce two hypotheses to explain how ancestral Asians became infected with subtype IV BKV.

AB Projected temperature increases under global warming could benefit southern tree species by providing them the optimal growing temperature and could be detrimental to northern species by exposing them to the supra optimal growing temperatures. This benefit-detriment trade-off could increase the competitive advantage of southern species in the northern species range and cause the increase or even dominance of southern species in the northern domain. However, the optimum temperature for photosynthesis of C3 plants may increase due to CO2 enrichment. An increase in the optimum temperature could greatly reduce the benefit-detriment effect. In this study, we coupled a forest ecosystem process model (PnET-II) and a forest GAP model (LINKAGES) with a spatially dynamic forest landscape model (LANDIS-II) to study how an optimum temperature increase could affect forest landscape response due to global warming. We simulated 360 years of forest landscape change in the Boundary Water Canoe Area (BWCA) in northern Minnesota, which is transitional between boreal and temperate forest. Our results showed that, under the control scenario of continuing the historic 1984-1993 mean climate (mainly temperature, precipitation and CO2), the BWCA will become a spruce-fir dominated boreal forest. However, under the scenario of predicted climatic change [the 2000-2099 climates are predicted by Canadian Climate Center (CCC), followed by 200 years of continuing the predicted 2090-2099 mean climate], the BWCA will become a pine-dominated mixed forest. If the optimum temperature increases gradually with [CO2] (the increase in optimum temperature is assumed to change gradually from O degrees C in year 2000 to 5 degrees C in year 2099 when [CO2] reaches 711ppm and stabilizes at 5 degrees C after year 2099), the BWCA would remain a fir-dominated boreal forest in areas with relatively high water-holding capacity, but not in areas with relatively low water-holding capacity. Our results suggest that the [CO2] induced increases in optimum temperature could substantially reduce forest landscape change caused by global warming. However, not all tree species would be able to successfully adapt to future warming as predicted by CCC, regardless of optimum temperature acclimations.

AB Phylogeography can reveal evolutionary processes driving natural genetic-geographical patterns in biota, providing an empirical framework for optimizing conservation strategies. The long-term population history of a rotting-log-adapted giant springtail (Collembola) from montane southeast Australia was inferred via joint analysis of mitochondrial and multiple nuclear gene genealogies. Contemporary populations were identified using multilocus nuclear genotype clustering. Very fine-scale sampling combined with nested clade and coalescent-based analyses of sequences from mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I and three unlinked nuclear loci uncovered marked population structure, deep molecular divergences, and abrupt phylogeographical breaks over distances on the order of tens of kilometres or less. Despite adaptations that confer low mobility, rare long-distance gene flow was implicated: novel computer simulations that jointly modelled stochasticity inherent in coalescent processes and that of DNA sequence evolution showed that incomplete lineage sorting alone was unable to explain the observed spatial-genetic patterns. Impacts of Pleistocene or earlier climatic cycles were detected on multiple timescales, and at least three putative moist forest refuges were identified. Water catchment divisions predict phylogeographical patterning and present-day population structure with high precision, and may serve as an excellent surrogate for biodiversity indication in sedentary arthropods from topographically heterogeneous montane temperate forests.

AB In modelling spatial distribution of species, ignoring spatial autocorrelation (SA) and multicollinearity may lead to false ecological conclusions. Here we take into account both issues for examining and modelling the spatial pattern of abundance of the globally threatened lesser kestrel (Falco naumanni) during summer in a 38,400ha area of northwestern Spain where large premigratory aggregations of the species occur. Spatial pattern was examined using Moran's correlogram, and models were built including geographical coordinates and autocovariate terms (which account for SA) in generalized linear models (GLM) and hierarchical partitioning (HP) models. HP models allow to alleviate multicollinearity. A grid-based approach was used by dividing the study area in 24 contiguous 4 km x 4 km squares where birds were counted in 2-3 visits per square (response variable). Environmental coarse-grained variables were extracted from a geographic information system (GIS) at three spatial extents. Moran's correlogram showed that lesser kestrel mean abundance per square was spatially autocorrelated up to 4-8 km. The results from both GLM and HP analyses were roughly compatible. The GLM models explained 80.0% of the variation in kestrel abundance and were the same at the three spatial extents. Lesser Kestrel abundance was not significantly explained by landscape variables, but was negatively related to both the distance to the nearest communal roost and distance to the nearest breeding colony with more of 10 breeding pairs of lesser kestrel. An autocovariate term added later in the GLM models improved both their explanatory power (from 74.5 to 80.0%) and model residuals, which were not longer spatially autocorrelated, fulfilling thus the statistical assumption of independent errors. Findings suggest that the spatial distribution of abundance of summering lesser kestrel is, at least, partially driven by endogenous causes, such as conspecific attraction. Exogenous causes such as finer-scale variables (e.g. type of crops and food available) are yet likely needed for lesser kestrel-environment relationships. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Given the increasing competition for marine resources, regulatory strategies that benefit multiple stakeholders are increasingly important. Offshore wind power generating facilities are becoming more common in the marine environment and alter the characteristics of the fisheries in the surrounding area. Floating wind turbines can act as fish aggregating devices (FAD), thereby increasing the catchability for some species. Many marine recreational fisheries are open access without effort restrictions; therefore, control of total harvest is difficult. Creating a limited entry recreational fishery and excluding commercial fishing from the area surrounding offshore wind turbines may aid in controlling total harvest and may benefit several important stakeholder groups: (1) recreational and commercial fishermen in terms of higher recreational catch rates and potentially higher overall yield, (2) fisheries managers in terms of more precise control of recreational fisheries harvest, and (3) owners of offshore wind power facilities in terms of reduced risk of damage to infrastructure due to fishing activity. We discuss the compatibility of wind power facilities and fisheries, conditions conducive to this compatibility, and provide an example from a proposed offshore wind power facility in the Adriatic Sea and its potential to affect the fisheries management there, particularly for bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynuus).

AB Seasonal changes in photosynthetic capacity, leaf nitrogen (N) content and N partitioning were studied from before leaf maturation (spring) until death (autumn) in high- and low-light-exposed leaves of a deciduous shrub, Lindera umbellata var. membranacea (Maxim.) Momiyama growing in a natural forest in northeast Japan. In spring, light-saturated photosynthetic rate (P-max) was low despite high leaf N and Rubisco contents, indicating that the photosynthetic apparatus was not yet functionally developed. Rubisco seemed to be only partially active. In summer and autumn, P-max, per unit leaf N increased and changes in P-max were correlated with changes in leaf N and two photosynthetic components, Rubisco and chlorophyll. Changes in these components paralleled the changes in leaf N. During leaf senescence, about 70% of leaf N was resorbed. Metabolic proteins that accounted for the majority of leaf N in summer were highly degradable and more than sufficient to explain the high N-resorption efficiency. Structural proteins represented only a small part of leaf N and were relatively resistant to degradation and thus contributed little to N resorption. Leaf N partitioning between metabolic and structural proteins determined the amount of retranslocatable N, but did not strictly determine the N content of a dead leaf or N-resorption efficiency.

AB Crop root growth and grain yield can be affected by chemical modifications in the soil profile due to surface lime application. A field trial was carried out on a loamy dystrophic Typic Hapludox at Ponta Grossa, State of Parana, Brazil, to evaluate root growth and grain yield of wheat (Triticum aestivum L. cv. CD 104, moderately susceptible to Al), about 10 years after surface liming (0, 2, 4, and 6 Mg ha(-1)) and three years after surface re-liming (0 and 3 Mg ha(-1)), in a long-term no-till cultivation system. Soil acidity limited wheat root growth and yield severely, probably as a result of extended water deficits during the vegetative stage. Surface liming caused increases up to 66% in the root growth (0-60 cm) and up to 140% in the grain yield. Root density and grain yield were correlated positively with soil pH and exchangeable Ca2+, and negatively with exchangeable Al3+ and Al3+ saturation, in the surface and subsurface layers.

AB Road Watch in the Pass is a citizen-science project that engages local citizens in reporting wildlife observations along a 44-km stretch of Highway 3 through Crowsnest Pass in southwestern Alberta, Canada. The numbers of wildlife vehicle collisions and a recent proposal to expand the highway have raised concerns from both human safety and wildlife conservation perspectives. Through the use of a web-based GIS, interested citizens can contribute information that will be instrumental in making final decisions concerning measures to mitigate the effects of highway expansion. Currently, 58 people have contributed over 713 observations to Road Watch. We performed a preliminary comparison of 11 months of Road Watch observations and wildlife mortality data for the same time period to demonstrate that the use of citizen science not only augments more conventional approaches, but also results in the emergence of new knowledge and insights. A Kappa index of agreement of 14% indicates poor agreement between the data sets, highlighting that wildlife successfully cross the highway in areas not identified by the wildlife mortality data. This has important implications for design and mitigation efforts for Highway 3 and other roadways.

AB Terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) is a DNA-based technique used to examine microbial community structure. We used this technique to examine variability in microbial community structure in 3 pools and a riffle in a semipermanent stream that becomes a chain of pools during the summer. We examined microbial communities under 3 hydrological conditions: predrought (all sites inundated), drought (all sediments dried for >= 2 mo), and rewet (1 mo after inundation). We used nonmetric multidimensional scaling to ordinate microbial communities and analysis of similarity to test whether communities differed among sites and whether community structure within sites changed in response to drought and rewetting. Microbial communities within sites differed with respect to hydrological condition, with most within-site variability occurring within the riffle section of the stream. Sediment drying significantly changed the microbial community structure at all sites. One month after rewetting at all sites, the microbial communities had not returned to their predrought structures and were significantly different from the predrought and drought microbial communities. Within-site variability in microbial community structure was much lower after the drought than before the drought. T-RFLP proved to be a powerful method for resolving microbial community structure, and its application helped address our limited understanding of microbial community dynamics.

AB Twenty-three published Penaeus monodon microsatellites were screened for inclusion in a DNA parentage marker suite by examining their ease of amplification, reliability of allele calling and Mendelian inheritance in an Australian captive population. Seven highly polymorphic markers (mean H-e=0.87 and PIC=0.84) were identified from the original 23 as being suitable for inclusion in the parentage marker suite. These seven microsatellites were evaluated for their combined ability to assign parentage to progeny from 13 families where genealogy was known. All progeny were correctly assigned to their true parents highlighting the usefulness of this marker suite to retain pedigree information in this species. Further, simulations based on broodstock allele frequencies suggested that the marker suite would be robust enough to identify progeny from up to 20 communally stocked families.
   This study highlights the importance of properly evaluating individual microsatellite markers before undertaking parentage analyses. Crown Copyright (c) 2005 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Because stand growth and the uptake of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) are proportional under most circumstances, a goal of silvicultural operations should be to increase uptake of nutrients by crop trees. The objectives of this study were to determine the effects of annual fertilization (average of 72 kg N ha(-1) y(-1) and total of 154 kg P ha(-1)) and complete elimination of interspecific competition on stand growth, N and P uptake, N and P budgets, and fertilizer retention in 13-year-old of loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) stands growing in the Lower Coastal Plain of Georgia, USA. At age 13, fertilization increased average tree height from 14.8 to 19.3 m, average tree diameter from 14.5 to 19.3 cm, and stand basal area from 27.6 to 42.6 m(2) ha(-1). Competition control increased average tree height from 46.5 to 17.5 m, average tree diameter from 16.3 to 17.6 cm, and stand basal area from 31.9 to 38.3 m(2) ha(-1). The relative amount of biomass partitioned among the aboveground biomass components was not affected by treatments, but fertilization and complete competition control decreased the biomass of fine roots, a trend opposite that for aboveground biomass. In general, complete competition control had little effect on nutrient concentrations or contents. Annual N uptake at age 13 was approximately 100 and 60 kg ha(-1) in the fertilized and nonfertilized stands, respectively. Annual uptake for P in nonfertilized stands averaged 7.5 kg ha(-1) while that in fertilized stands averaged 10 kg ha(-1). With the exception of stem bark N concentration and foliar P concentration, fertilization increased the N and P concentrations of the aboveground biomass components. Nitrogen contents in the aboveground biomass ranged from less than 160 kg ha(-1) in the control stands to almost 410 kg ha(-1) in the fertilized stands. Phosphorus contents ranged from approximately 12 kg ha(-1) in the control stands to 27 kg ha(-1). In contrast to the aboveground biomass, standing fine root N contents were 15.2, 16.4, 8.7, and 7.6 kg ha(-1) while standing P contents were 2.22, 1.73, 1.09, and 0.95 kg ha(-1) for the control, fertilize only, competition control only, fertilizer + competition control treatments, respectively. The large N and P uptake in these stands facilitated an estimated retention of 90% of N fertilizer and > 100% of P fertilizer in the soils, O horizon, and living biomass of the fertilized stands. These results underscore the importance of nutrition to stand growth, raise the bar for the potential productivity of loblolly pine in the southeastern United States, and indicate that it is possible to aggressively fertilize these nutrient poor systems with potentially few offsite impacts.

AB Interspecific hybridization is a well-established cause of unisexual origins in vertebrates. This mechanism is also suspected in other apomictic taxa, but compelling evidence is rare. Here, we evaluate this mechanism and other hypotheses for the evolutionary origins of unisexuality through an investigation of Calligrapha leaf beetles. This group provides an intriguing subject for studies of unisexual evolution because it presents a rare insect example of multiple apomictic thelytokous species within a primarily bisexual genus. To investigate unisexual evolution, this study conducts the first molecular systematic analysis of Calligrapha. This involved the collection and analysis of about 3000 bp of DNA sequences-representing RNA and protein-coding loci from mitochondrial and nuclear genomes-from 54 specimens of 25 Calligrapha species, including four unisexual tetraploid taxa. Phylogenetic and molecular clock analyses indicated independent and single evolutionary origins of each of these unisexual species during the Pleistocene. Significant phylogenetic incongruence was detected between mitochondrial and nuclear datasets and found to be especially associated with the asexual taxa. This pattern is expected when unisexual lineages arise via interspecific hybridization and thus represent genetic mosaics that possess certain nuclear alleles from the paternal species lineage and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) alleles from the maternal parent. Analyzing the mtDNA and nuclear relatedness of unisexuals with corresponding haplotypes of bisexual Calligrapha species allowed the putative identification of these maternal and paternal species lineages for each unisexual species. Strong phenotypic similarities between unisexual taxa and their paternal parent species supported a model that involves both backcrosses of interspecific hybrids with a paternal parent and unreduced gametes. This model accounts for the origins, of apomixis, polyploidy, and an overrepresentation of paternal nuclear alleles (and associated phenotypes) in unisexuals. This model is also consistent with the tetraploid karyotypes of unisexual Calligrapha, in which three sets of chromosomes (of presumed paternal ancestry) are quite morphologically homogeneous compared to the fourth. Especially intriguing was a consistent association of unisexual species with the host plant of the paternal parent but never with the maternal host. The statistical implausibility of these patterns occurring by chance further supports our inference of parental species. Moreover, it points to a potentially critical role for host-association in the formation and preservation of unisexual lineages. These findings suggest that ecological factors are critical for the diversification of unisexual as well as bisexual taxa and thus point out new research directions in the area of ecological specification.

AB The importance and strength of bottom-up forces in terrestrial soil systems are poorly understood. In contrast to aquatic systems, where trophic cascades and top-down forces dominate, it has been postulated that terrestrial systems are regulated mainly by bottom-up forces. We set up a 17 month field experiment to study the effects of addition of resources of different quality (wood, wheat bran, pet food, and glucose + phosphorous + nitrogen) on the soil micro-, meso- and macrofauna as well as on microbial biomass, ergosterol content and abiotic parameters (soil pH, water content, carbon and nitrogen content) in a beech forest (Fagus sylvatica) on sandstone. We hypothesized that bottom-up effects will be strong on lower trophic levels resulting in increased biomass of bacteria and fungi, and that this increase will propagate to higher trophic levels (microbivorous invertebrates, predators) but with decreasing intensity due to dampening of bottom-up forces at higher trophic levels by high connectivity, trophic-level-omnivory and generalist feeding. The results of the Study in general did not support these hypotheses. Microbial biomass only moderately increased after resource addition, and while densities of several animal groups increased (lumbricids, nematodes, collembolans, gamasid mites, staphylinid beetles), densities of other groups declined (oribatid mites, prostigmate mites, lithobiids), and a large number of taxa remained unaffected (enchytraeids, diplopods, uropodine Mites, pseudoscorpions, spiders). We conclude that (a) bottom-up forces are of limited importance in the soil system of temperate deciduous forests, (b) large primary decomposers, such as earthworms, do not depend on microorganisms as food but consume organic matter directly, (c) the link between microorganisms and microbivores, such as collembolans, is weak since collembolan density increased even though microbial biomass was unaffected, (d) habitat modification by ecosystem engineers, Such as earthworms, is more important than resource availability for a number of soil invetebrates including prostigmate mites and centipedes, and (e) the soil food web in general is rather resistant responding little to changes in resource supply. The results also suggest that species which commonly are assigned to single trophic groups, such as collembolans, differently respond to changes of the base of the food web. Increased fungal biomass led to an increase in the density of Folsomia quadrioculata s.l. and Isotomiella minor, whereas the increased bacterial biomass was accompanied by an increase in density of Ceratophysella denticulata and Isotoma notabilis.

AB Genetic data obtained using faecal DNA were used to elucidate the population structure of four brush-tailed rock-wallaby (Petrogale penicillata) colonies located in Wollemi National Park, New South Wales. The results suggested that the four sampled colonies are genetically differentiated and do not form a panmictic unit. Based on assignment tests, approximately 5% of sampled individuals were inferred to be dispersers and both male and female migrants were detected. Multilocus spatial autocorrelation analyses provided evidence for increased philopatry among females compared to males within the largest colony in the valley. Females in close spatial proximity were more genetically similar than expected under a random distribution of females, and females separated by more than 400 m were less genetically similar than expected. In contrast, there was no evidence of a significant clustering of related males. This suggests that within-colony dispersal is male biased. We also investigated the best strategies for conserving genetic diversity in this population. All of the four sampled colonies were found to contain distinct components of the genetic diversity of the Wolgan Valley P. penicillata population and loss of any colony is likely to result in the loss of unique alleles. Conservation and management plans should take into account that these colonies represent genetically differentiated discrete subpopulations. This approach is also the best strategy for maintaining the genetic diversity of the populations in this valley.

AB Protected areas arc the most common and most important strategy for biodiversity conservation and are called for under the United Nations' Convention on Biological Diversity. However, most protected areas have been designed to represent (and in theory protect for perpetuity) specific natural features, species and ecological communities in-situ, and have not taken into account potential shifts in ecosystem distribution and composition that could be induced by global climatic change. This paper provides an overview of the policy and planning implications of climate change for protected areas in Canada, summarizes a portfolio of climate change adaptation options that have been discussed in the conservation literature and by conservation professionals and provides a perspective on what is needed for the conservation community in Canada to move forward on responding to the threat posed by climate change.

AB 1. Understanding ecosystem responses to plant species loss is essential for the optimal management of grasslands. Recent studies have examined the effects of simulated random species loss in experimental plant communities but not those of realistic non-random species loss resulting from transient extinction pressures in semi-natural grasslands.
   2. To investigate the potential effects of non-random species loss on grassland productivity, we established mesocosms with mixed communities comprising 15 plant species, and exposed them to 2 years of high-intensity management (an extinction phase) followed by 2 years of low-intensity management (a restoration phase) allowing recolonization from differentially managed neighbouring plots. In addition, monocultures of each component species were subject to the same extinction-restoration phases.
   3. During the extinction phase, species with high monoculture biomass had lower extinction probabilities in the mixed community than species with low monoculture biomass, but there was also species-specific variation. The species that were most productive or most persistent during the extinction phase were not the same as those performing best in the restoration phase.
   4. No consistent effects of spontaneous recolonization from neighbouring communities on species richness or productivity of the focal communities were observed during the restoration phase.
   5. We estimated that extinction of all but the species with the lowest extinction risk reduced biomass productivity by 42-49%; loss of all but the four species with the lowest extinction risk reduced it by 2-35%. Identical calculations for a random extinction scenario yielded reductions of 52% and 26-54%, respectively.
   6. Synthesis and applications. Prediction of the effects of species loss on plant production and on other aspects of ecosystem functioning in semi-natural grasslands must account for both specific non-random extinction processes and post-extinction conditions. For European mesic grasslands experiencing a shift from high-intensity to low-intensity management, our results suggest that recolonization by 'missing' species must be actively assisted if high production is a management objective.

AB Inbreeding has negative effects on individual and population performances. Therefore, enhancement of offspring genetic diversity is believed to play a major role in shaping mating systems. However, no study has clearly separated the direct effect of having multiple partners from the indirect effect of having more outbred offspring on the resulting reproductive success of individuals in the wild. In this study, we report significant associations between both multiple mating and within-individual genetic diversity of offspring, and an increased reproductive success of wild female Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar. Specifically, we found that females with a higher number of mates also have more outbred offspring (within-individuals), and that both of these characteristics increased their reproductive success expressed in terms of offspring surviving when combining all freshwater juvenile stages. Our findings also indicate that determinants of fitness are different among sexes as within-individual offspring genetic diversity was not a strong predictor of male reproductive success, while the number of mates was important. We also show that females mated with more outbred males than on average, which potentially increased their chances of producing outbred offspring. These results therefore suggest that there could be more important indirect genetic benefits of multiple mating for females than for males.

Their geographic variation, based on 1515 specimens involving 33 characters of coloration and scutellation, was analyzed in two different ways: (1) an hierarchical analysis and (2) an analysis of principal components and discriminant function. Sexual dimorphism occurred in many characters and for those, females and males were analyzed separately.
   The results confirmed the distinctiveness of the three original species. Within L. colubrina different characters displayed slightly different geographic patterns of variation, but overall five general groupings of populations could be discerned: (1) a north-south axis from Sabah, north through the Philippines to Taiwan and the Ryukyus, (2) an east-west axis encompassing localities from the Andaman and Nicobar Islands in the west through New Guinea and the Solomon Islands in the east, (3) the eastern islands of Vanuatu, Fiji, and Tonga, (4) a partially isolated population in Palau, and finally (5) an isolate in southern Papua. Despite significant differences among these regions, different characters showed slightly different patterns of sic geographic variation across their boundaries; similarly, within each axis the pattern variation among islands differed for different characters. Divergence was deemed sufficiently consistent to warrant taxonomic distinction only in the case of the population in southern Papua that was accorded recognition as a new species, Laticauda guineai. In some characters, widely peripheral populations were more similar morphologically to each other than to more central ones, and alternative hypotheses accounting for this are discussed.
   The observed distribution an(] the geographic patterns of variation Lire attributable to a combination of present and past ecological restrictions, directions of sea Currents, and paleogeography.

AB The aim of the work was to compare autumnal photosynthesis and remobilization processes in apple (Malus domestica) trees harvested either at commercial harvest date or 6 wk later (delayed harvest).
   Apple leaf photosynthesis, measured by porometry, remained large at 8-14 mumol CO2 m(-2) s(-1) and was not limited by stomatal function after the commercial harvest date. The autumnal reduction both in photosynthesis and in vivo RUBISCO activity was less pronounced in apple trees with a delayed harvest. Maximum photochemical efficiency (F-v : F-m) of apple leaves also remained large at 0.80 for 3 wk after the commercial harvest date. The subsequent decreases in both maximum photochemical efficiency (F-v : F-m) and chlorophyll content were delayed by 2 wk in trees harvested 6 wk later.
   Long shoot leaves developed red-blue anthocyanin colouration 2 wk after harvest, accompanied by greater leaf carbohydrate content. This was by marked contrast to long shoot leaves of still-fruiting apple trees, which lacked this anthocyanin colouration. Potassium, phosphorus and nitrogen declined more rapidly in the leaves of apple trees harvested at the commercial date, an indication of earlier remobilization.
   In conclusion, fruit harvest accelerated leaf senescence, indicated by chlorophyll breakdown and remobilization of nutrients in both spur and long shoot leaves, and, additionally, by commencing anthocyanin synthesis in long shoot leaves.

AB Pinus pinaster is a conifer native to western Europe and northern Africa. Following on-going breeding programmes, provenance and progeny trials were established in some of the countries of the species' range (France, Portugal and Spain) and quantitative traits were measured: growth, stem form, survival and pest and disease resistance, amongst others. Populations from the wide range of P. pinaster were recently screened with molecular markers in order to assess their genetic diversity. Data were obtained using allozymes, chloroplast (cpSSRs) and nuclear (nuSSRs) microsatellites and amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs). Based on mtDNA-RFLP analysis, three maternal lineages (named "western", "eastern" and "Moroccan) were identified and no population showed a mixed composition. In this study, the imprint that differentiation in putatively isolated glacial refugia (identified by the different maternal lineages) might have left on the nuclear genome was analysed using a wide range of molecular markers and adaptive traits. Multivariate ordination of populations based on nuclear molecular markers (allozymes and nuSSRs) showed a clear clustering of provenances sharing a given mtDNA lineage. However, that clustering was found to be less tight when only quantitative traits were investigated. In P. pinaster, the within-population estimates of gene diversity using different traits were not correlated. Therefore, caution is advisable when designing conservation strategies based on molecular marker studies or a limited number of populations. After these results, we recommend a conservation strategy characterised by gene flow consistent with the current population structure, careful seed transfer among maternal lineages (if any), selection of populations for conservation based on the originality of their allelic composition and definition of Management Units (MUs) based on adaptive traits.

AB We examined the effects of habitat fragmentation of the white-starred robin Pogonocichla stellata metapopulation in the Taita Hills archipelago, a hotspot for biodiversity which was fragmented similar to40 years ago. Using seven microsatellite markers, we analysed the robin's genetic structure and tested for equilibrium between migration and drift (testing the probability of decreased dispersal) as well as between mutation and drift (test for recent reduction in effective population size, i.e. bottlenecks). This metapopulation was found to retain relatively high levels of genetic variability (H-E between 0.63 and 0.71) and to be in migration-drift equilibrium, suggesting that increased isolation between fragments did not have much effect on the dispersal between them. Furthermore, this equilibrium test greatly enhanced the interpretation of parameters (e.g. F-ST) assumed to have reached an equilibrium value. In contrast to previous findings on the related and sympatric Taita thrush Turdus helleri (which is critically endangered), there were no indications for recent bottlenecks in any of the robin subpopulations. This difference can be attributed to the higher dispersal capacity of the robin compared with the thrush (deduced from both the genetic and capture-recapture data). Our results stress the importance of sustained dispersal for species conservation.

AB The parrot genus Aratinga comprises 20 species that can be separated, based on morphological characters, in at least three distinct groups. We performed a phylogenetic analysis based on mtDNA sequences of individuals belonging to the solstitialis group with the objectives of. (1) assessing the genetic differences among individuals in order to clarify their specific status; (2) testing the monophyly of the group and establishing its phylogenetic position relative to other Aratinga species, (3) making inferences about temporal and geographical patterns of diversification in the Neotropics. As a result of the analysis, the three taxa belonging to the Aratinga solstitialis complex were found to be diagnosable phylogenetic species, the monotypic genus Nandayus was found to be included in the solstitialis group and the non-monophyly of the genus Aratinga was confirmed. Most of the speciation events occurred during the Pliocene and Pleistocene and may be related to habitat shifts associated to climate oscillation during these periods. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc.

AB We tested the inter-specific variability in the ability of three dominant grasses of temperate grasslands to take up organic nitrogen (N) in the form of amino acids in soils of differing fertility. Amino acid uptake was determined by injecting dual labeled glycine-2-C-13-N-15 into the soil, and then measuring the enrichment of both C-13 and N-15 in plant tissue after 50 hours. We found enrichment of both C-13 and N-15 in root and shoot material of all species in both soils, providing first evidence for direct uptake of glycine. We show that there was considerable inter-specific variability in amino acid uptake in the low fertility soil. Here, direct uptake of amino acid was greater in the grass Agrostis capillaris, which typically dominates low fertility grassland, than Lolium perenne, which inhabits more fertile sites. Direct uptake of amino acid for Holcus lanatus was intermediate between the above two species. Unlike in the low fertility soil, there was no difference in uptake of either C-13 or N-15 by grasses in the high fertility soil, where uptake of mineral N is thought to be the major mechanism of N uptake of these grasses. Overall, our findings may contribute to our understanding of differences in competitive interactions between grasses in soils of different fertility status.

AB Fascioliasis by Fosciola hepatica is the vector-borne disease presenting. the widest latitudinal, longitudinal and altitudinal distribution known. F. hepatica shows a great adaptation power to new environmental conditions which is the consequence of its own capacities together with the adaptation and colonization abilities of its specific vector hosts, freshwater snails of the family Lymnaeidae. Several lymnaeid species only considered as secondary contributors to the liver fluke transmission have, however, played a very important role in the geographic expansion or this disease. Many of them belong to the so-coiled "stagnicoline" type group. Stagnicolines have, therefore, a very important applied interest in the Holarctic region, to which they are geographically restricted. The present knowledge on the genetics of stagnicolines and on their parasite-host interrelationships is, however, far from being sufficient. The present paper analyses the relationships between Palaearctic and Nearciic stagnicoline species on the base of the new light furnished hy the results obtained in nuclear ONA ITS-2 sequencing and corresponding phylogenetic studies of the lymnaeid taxa Lymnaea (Stagnicola) occulta, L. (S.) palustris palustris (itopotype specimens) and L. (S.) p. turricula from Europe. Natural infections with F. hepatica have been reported in all of them. Surprisingly, ITS-2 similar and perfectly fitted within the respective ranges known in North American stagnicolines. Nucleotide differences and genetic distances were higher between L. occulta and the other European siagnicolines than between L. occulta and the North American ones. The ITS-2 sequence of L. p. turricula from Poland differed From the other genotypes known from turricula in Europe. The phylogenetic trees using the maximum-parsimony, distance and maximum-likelihood methods confirmed (i) the inclusion of L. occulia in the branch of North American stagnicolines, (it) the link between the North American stagnicolines-L. occulta group with Galba truncatula, and (iii) the location of the L. p. turricula genotypes from Poland closer to L. p. palustris than to other p. turricula genotypes. The Palaearctic species occulta is included in the genus Catascopia, together with the Nearctic species catascopium, emarginata and elodes. The results suggest a potential a,, transmission capacity for C. occulta higher than that at other European stagnicolines or Omphiscola glabra. The relatively low genetic distances between C. occulta and G. truncatula and the clustering of both species in the some clade suggest that C. occulta may be potentially considered as the second lymnaeid intermediate host species of F. hepatica in importance in eastern and northern Europe, and probably also western and central Asia, after G. truncatula. L. p. turricula may be considered as a potential secondary vector of F. hepatica, at a level similar to that of L. p. polustris.

Our particular interest is to estimate the phyletic position of Deltamys, a taxon endemic to a small portion of the La Plata river basin in Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay, and to assess its generic status. The three primary conclusions derived from our analyses are: (1) cotton rats (Sigmodon) are the sister group of the remaining sigmodontines, (2) the tribe Akodontini is monophytetic with moderate support, and (3) Deltamys falls outside of a clade containing all species of subgenera of Akodon yet examined, and thus we grant Deltamys status of full genus.

AB The evolutionary importance of cryptic taxa is well documented, yet few studies have examined them with a view to conservation. In the present study, the significance of cryptic speciation in freshwater crabs is examined. Allozyme and 16S rRNA sequence data were used to explore the degree of population differentiation between mountain stream populations of two distinct freshwater crab species. Marked patterns of differentiation were evident among populations; those in close geographical proximity were characterized by the fixation of alternate alleles at certain loci, indicating that currently there is no gene flow among populations. Both allozyme and sequence data provide evidence for the recognition of at least five distinct evolutionary lineages with pronounced levels of genetic differentiation. Morphometric data failed to detect any distinct geographically intermediate population groupings. Our findings indicate the presence of five phylogeographical units, all worthy of conservation, three of which are evolutionarily significant.

AB A study was undertaken to establish the diversity within the Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius) species complex in Argentina using the mitochondria cytochrome oxidase I gene (mt COI) as a molecular marker. For one haplotype, common to cotton in the Santiago Province, biotic characters were evaluated, and included host range and life history traits: fecundity, generation time, intrinsic rate of increase, longevity, and rate of reproduction. To investigate genetic diversity, B. tabaci were collected from representative geographical locations and host plants in six provinces of Argentina. Also, B. tabaci found colonizing tomato plants in nearby Bolivia, which exhibited viruslike symptoms, were included in the study. We report, for the first time, the presence of the introduced V biotype in Argentina, and present evidence for indigenous or 'local' B. tabaci haplotypes in both Argentina (ARG) and Bolivia (BOL), which collectively formed a distinctive, South American phylogeographic grouping of New World B. tabaci. Two closely related ARG haplotypes, ARG2/3 from Salta and Tucaman, and ARG1 from Santiago, shared 98.7% identity, whereas the Bolivian haplotype (BOL), their closet relative, shared 99.4% and 99.9% identity with ARG1 and ARG2/3, respectively. Mt COI sequences for collections identified as the 'B' biotype from Argentina (ARG4/5) shared 99.5-100% nt identity with the five 'B' biotype reference sequences and colonies established for ARG4 and ARG5 were capable of inducing silvering in Cucurbita spp., confirming their identity as the B bioytpe. The closest relatives to the ARG/BOL haplotypes were members of the North/Central American clade of B. tabaci with which they shared 4.6 to 8.6% identity, indicating that the ARG and BOL B. tabaci are of New World origin. The latter range of divergence is similar to that estimated for the Old World B biotype and its closest relatives from the Mediterranean region, at 5.4 to 6.4%. Divergence estimates for Old World X Old World and New World X Old World phylogeographical clades were 14.6 to 16.2% and 14.4 to 17.4%, respectively, indicating that haplotypes in both eastern and western hemispheres exhibit substantial diversity from one another. Despite the somewhat more moderate interclade divergence for New World compared with Old World clades, the South American B. tabaci formed a distinctive New World clade, suggesting a common ancestry with other previously studied New World taxa, from which they are separated by geographical barriers. Life history traits for the cotton-associated B. tabaci haplotype (ARG1) were most similar to those previously reported for the polyphagous A biotype, AZA, from Arizona, and differed substantially with respect to the B biotype.

   IMPACT
AB By analysing records made in the northern taiga forests of the Lapland Reserve (Kola Peninsula, Russia) during 1930-1998, we unexpectedly discovered a decline in the length of the snow-free and ice-free periods by 15-20 days due to both delayed spring and advanced autumn/winter. Respective seasonal temperatures best explained the dates of all phenological phases: 1degreesC shift in temperature was approximately equal to 2-5 day shift in phenology. However the phenological shifts during the observation period are much larger than could be expected from the slight (0.56degreesC) drop in temperatures during August-September, suggesting that the biotic effects of a very slight cooling have been enhanced by one or more unknown factors. Although emissions of sulphur dioxide from the nickel-copper smelter at Monchegorsk may have contributed to the observed trend (via changes in regional radiative budget), we found no evidence of direct pollution impact on dates of birch autumnal coloration or birch leaf fall, which exhibited the largest (22 days) shift between 1930 and 1998. The detected phenological trends agree with an increase in winter (snow) precipitation in the study area by 44%; however, effects of precipitation on any of the investigated phenological phases were far from significant. Our results highlight the importance of phenological records for the assessment of past regional environmental changes, and demonstrates that the prediction of even the simplest biotic responses to the Global Changes requires a profound understanding of the interactive impact of abiotic factors on the ecosystem.

AB Little attention has been paid to the effect of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi on the uptake of nutrients that move mainly by mass flow. The objective of this study was to assess the possible contribution of indigenous AM fungi to the K, Ca and Mg nutrition of maize (Zea mays L.) as influenced by soil P levels and its impact on plant dry mass. The field experiment had a split plot design with four replicates. Treatments included soil fumigation status (fumigation and non-fumigation) and three levels of P fertilization (0, 60 and 120 kg P2O5 ha(-1)) in a loamy sand soil in 1997 and a fine sandy loam soil in 1998. Soil fumigation with Basamid(R) was used to suppress indigenous AM fungi. Plants were sampled at four different growth stages (6-leaf stage, 10-leaf stage, tasseling and silking). Soil fumigation decreased shoot dry weight, but P fertilization increased shoot dry weight at most sampling times. When no P fertilizer was added, fumigation in the loamy sand soil reduced shoot K and Ca concentrations while, in contrast, in the fine sandy loam soil only Mg concentration was reduced by soil fumigation. The concentration of K in maize shoots was positively correlated (P < 0.05) with extraradicular hyphal length in both soils. The correlation between the abundance of extraradicular hyphae and the concentrations of Ca and Mg in maize shoots was significant only for soils where available Ca or Mg was relatively low. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi could increase corn biomass production and K, Ca and Mg uptake in soil low in these elements and low in P. These results indicate that the contribution of mycorrhizae to maize K, Ca and Mg nutrition can be significant in a field situation and that the extent of this contribution depends on the availability of these nutrients and of P in soils.

AB We investigated the adaptation of three spruce species (Picea glehnii Masters, P jezoensis Carr. and R abies Karst.) to growth in northern Japan on serpentine soils (characterized by high concentrations of heavy metals and Mg, a low Ca/Mg ratio and low fertility) and fertile brown forest soils. Among species, seedling survival on serpentine soil was highest in R glehnii. Shoot growth of R glehnii was similar whether grown on serpentine or brown forest soil, whereas shoot growth of the other species was significantly less on serpentine soil than on brown forest soil. On serpentine soil, needle life span of R glehnii was at least 3 years longer than that of the other two species. Needle area per shoot of R glehnii was significantly higher on serpentine soil than on brown forest soil up to a shoot age of 8 years. In all three species, light-saturated photosynthetic rate (P-max) decreased with needle age independently of soil type. However, on serpentine soil, P.. in P glehnii was higher, particularly in older needles, than in the other species. Furthermore, on serpentine soil, needle concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus were higher in R glehnii than in the other species. We conclude that R glehnii is better adapted to serpentine soil than P. jezoensis and R abies at least in part because of its greater needle life span and higher needle nutrient concentrations.

AB The interactive effects of irradiance and N on growth of young tomato plants (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) were studied. Plants were grown at 70 or 300 mumol photons m(-2) s(-1), hereafter referred to as 'low' and 'high' irradiance, and at a range of exponential N supply rates (70-370 mg g(-1) d(-1)) or at a constant concentration in the nutrient solution of 12 mM NO3-. At both irradiance levels, leaf area ratio was more important than net assimilation rate (NAR) in explaining effects of N on growth at mild N limitation. However, at severe N limitation, NAR became the most important parameter, as indicated by calculated growth response coefficients. Furthermore, this study shows that N supply and growth irradiance interacted strongly. The decrease of specific leaf area with increasing N limitation and increasing growth irradiance correlated with increasing leaf dry mass percentage and starch concentration. Furthermore, at low irradiance, plants partitioned more dry mass to the stem. Dry mass partitioning to roots increased with decreasing plant N concentration, and this relation appeared to be independent of irradiance. Shading increased plant N concentration and decreased dry mass partitioning to roots. Also, the relationship between plant N concentration and N partitioning to different plant organs was largely independent of growth irradiance.

AB The use of molecular genetic techniques can aid wildlife managers in setting priorities and devising management strategies for scattered populations of threatened taxa. In this study, six remnant populations of the "critically endangered" brush-tailed rock-wallaby (Petrogale penicillata) in Victoria, Australia, were examined using karyotypic, microsatellite (11 loci) and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region sequence analysis. Each remnant population was found to be genetically distinct (unique microsatellite alleles and control region haplotypes), but had low genetic diversity. This distribution of genetic diversity between, rather than within populations, is most likely a consequence of recent severe reductions in population size and dispersal that have occurred since European settlement. The six mtDNA control region haplotypes identified in the Victorian populations were all closely related (average 1.3% sequence divergence), and only 2% divergence separated haplotypes from East Gippsland and the Grampians (550 km to the west). In contrast there was considerable sequence divergence (7.7%) between the Victorian haplotypes and those found in P. penicillata from elsewhere in the species range. In comparison, 8.8% divergence separates P. penicillata from the closely related P. herberti. The Victorian haplotypes also formed a distinct and well supported monophyletic group that excluded haplotypes from other P. penicillata and P. herberti. In light of these data, we recommend that the remnant Victorian populations of P. penicillata be managed separately from remaining populations in New South Wales and Queensland; and that individuals be regularly exchanged amongst the Victorian populations to increase their diversity and reduce the likelihood of inbreeding depression.

AB Chondrostoma lusitanicum is a Portuguese endemic cyprinid with a restricted distribution and reduced numbers in some basins, justifying its status as a threatened species. We examined genetic population structure using samples from throughout its geographical range in Portugal, using sequencing of b cytochrome and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of the NADH subunits 5 and 6. There was reduced within-population genetic variability but considerable among-population differentiation, particularly marked between both the Mira and Arade basins in the extreme south and other populations. These results confirm phylogeographic relationships suggested by previous fragmentary allozyme studies for C. lusitanicum, and are in accordance with allozyme and mitochondrial DNA data on phylogeography of coexisting cyprinid species of the genus Leuciscus. The levels of genetic divergence revealed by sequence and RFLP data showed strongly concordant patterns: geographical genetic structuring, with the definition of three distinct groups, was observed. The high values of nucleotide divergence and pairwise sequence divergence of the Mira and Arade groups, when compared with all other samples, support a distinct taxonomic status probably at the species level. Results are also discussed in relation to conservation of this highly fragmented species, in terms of Evolutionary Significant Units and Management Units.

AB We conducted an experiment in a northern mixed-grass prairie at Wind Cave National Park. South Dakota, USA to evaluate the effect of defoliation frequency on aboveground net primary production (ANPP), shoot nitrogen concentration, and aboveground N yield of graminoids. ANPP was significantly reduced at weekly and biweekly defoliation frequencies, but unaffected relative to unclipped controls at monthly and bimonthly frequencies. By contrast, clipping at all frequencies increased shoot N concentration above that of controls, and this increase was greatest at monthly or more frequent defoliations. Total aboveground N yield and potential N yield to grazers were greatest at intermediate (bimonthly to biweekly) frequencies. We suggest that grazers may maximize their nutritional status in this system by periodically regrazing areas at Frequencies dear the approximately monthly optimum that we observed.

TI Reduction of Striga hermonthica parasitism on maize using soybean

LA English
DT Article
DE Striga hermonthica; soybean; P fertilizer; maize; savanna
AB Striga hermonthica is a serious parasite of cereals in most of the semi-arid savanna zone of West Africa, causing substantial yield loss. It has been observed that some soybean cultivars are capable of stimulating germination of S, hermonthica seed, which would reduce the seed bank in the soil. This study was undertaken to quantify the effect of a soybean crop (compared with a sorghum control) on S. hermonthica emergence in subsequent maize in three farmers' fields in northern Nigeria. Soybean cultivar TGx 1740-7F, previously identified as efficacious for S. hermonthica seed germination, was grown at four densities without P fertilizer to test the effect of increasing plant density of soybean on subsequent S. hermonthica parasitism. The effect of P as single super phosphate was tested on the two highest soybean densities. S. hermonthica parasitism on maize was significantly lower after unfertilized soybean than after the sorghum control treatment at two of three trial sites. Soybean rotation increased maize yield by approximately 90% for the three sites combined. Increasing soybean plant density did not result in lower emerged S. hermonthica. Application of P to soybean at the higher soybean densities resulted in higher root length density, lower emerged S, hermonthica on maize (P<0.15), and significantly higher maize yield. The results suggest that an efficacious cultivar of soybean reduces S. hermonthica parasitism on a succeeding maize crop and that the effect is increased by application of P to the soybean.

AB Growth of transgenic rice (Oryza sativa L.) with an antisense gene to the small subunit of Rubisco was analysed under 36 and 100 Pa CO2 during a 14-h photoperiod (1000 mu mol quanta m(-2) s(-1)). Two lines of the antisense plants were used; one with 65% wild-type Rubisco and the other with 40% wild-type Rubisco. The plants were grown hydroponically for 70 d. The final biomass of the antisense plants grown in 36 Pa CO2 was much smaller than that of the wild-type plant. However, several compensation phenomena were found in the antisense plants. Increased biomass allocation to leaf blades and preferential N investment in leaf blades were observed. Leaf senescence was also delayed. Elevated CO2 levels up to 100 Pa caused the antisense plants to achieve a size similar to that of the wild-type plant. However, although the antisense plant with 65% wild-type Rubisco was selected as a plant with optimal Rubisco content for CO2-saturated photosynthesis, its final biomass was not greater than that of the wildtype plant. This may have been caused by a relatively strong Rubisco-antisense effect during the early stage of growth (21-42 d). N-use efficiency for growth after d 42 was greater in the selected antisense plant. Thus, improvement of N-use efficiency at the level of a single leaf did not necessarily lead to greater production of biomass at the whole-plant level.

AB Since early 1989, we have conducted a large-scale ecological manipulation in a semiarid thorn scrub community in north-central Chile. We have excluded vertebrate predators (raptors and mammalian carnivores), and larger small mammal herbivore/competitors (i.e., degus, Octodon degus) from replicated 0.56-ha plots, and monitored small mammal population and plant responses over more than ten years. Repeated measures ANOVAs on minimum number known alive (MNKA) estimates of small mammals for a six-year period (1990-1996) spanning an El Nino event in 1991-1992 showed strong responses of some species to predator exclusions (e.g., O. degus; Darwin's leaf-eared mouse, Phyllotis darwini; the chinchilla-rat, Abrocoma bennetti). However, responses varied in time with significant effects during pre-El Nino (1990-1992) and El Nino (1992-1994) periods (i.e., 0. degus), or pre-El Nino and post-El Nino (1994-1996) periods (P. darwini. A. bennetti). Other species showed no responses to predator exclusions (e.g., olivaceous field mouse, Akodon olivaceus; long-haired field mouse, Abrothrix longipilis; long-tailed rice rat, Oligoryzomys longi caudatus). Some effects of competitor (degu) exclusions were detected (e.g., A. bennetti during the El Nino and post-El Nino periods; O. longicatrrlntus during the El Nino). "Top-down," factors (i.e., biotic interactions) appear to have greater effects on "core species" (i.e., P. darwini, O. degus) which persist in the thorn scrub. Other species (e.g., A. longipilis, O. longicaudatus) are transitory residents or "opportunistic" with lesser effects of biotic interactions, and their populations may be controlled by source-sink dynamics. All species had strong, responses to the 1991-1992 El Nino indicating primary control by "bottom-up" factors.

AB We present an evolutionary analysis of 13 species of Sarcocystis, including 4 newly sequenced species with ruminants as their intermediate host, based on complete small subunit rDNA sequences. Those species with ruminants as their intermediate host form a well-supported clade, and there are at least two major clades within this group, one containing those species forming microcysts and with dogs as their definitive host and the other containing those species forming macrocysts and with cats as their definitive host. Those species with nonruminants as their intermediate host form the paraphyletic sister group to these clades. Most of the species have considerable genotypic differences (differing in more than 100 nucleotide positions), except for S. buffalonis and S. hirsuta. There is a large suite of genotypic differences indicating that those species infecting ruminant and nonruminant hosts have had very different evolutionary histories, and similarly for the felid- and canid-infecting species. Furthermore, the rDNA sequences that represent the different structural regions of the rRNA molecule have very different genotypic behavior within Sarcocystis. The evolution of these regions should be functionally constrained, and their differences can be explained in terms of the importance of the nucleotide sequences to their functions.

AB Photosynthesis was studied in relation to light use in the mangrove, Avicennia marina (Forsk.) Vierh. var. australasica (Walp.) Moldenke, growing under soil salinities equivalent to one and two times seawater (i.e. 35 and 60 parts per thousand). Midday CO2 assimilation rates averaged 7.6 +/- 0.7 and 4.3 +/- 0.3 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) at the seawater and hypersaline sites, respectively. Despite this difference, xanthophyll pool sizes per Chl and epoxidation states were similar at both sites. Non-photochemical quenching also indicated comparable energy dissipation from pigment beds. Electron transport rates calculated from fluorescence characteristics were also similar and exceeded the requirements to sustain measured assimilation rates. However, cell wall conductance was low in seawater plants (75 mmol m(-2) s(-1)) and declined to 40 mmol m(-2) s(-1) in hypersaline plants. This would cause CO2 concentrations in chloroplasts (C-c) to be lower than expected from measurements of intercellular CO2 concentrations (C-i). In seawater plants, C-c was estimated to be 144 mmol mol(-1) when C-i was 245 mmol mol(-1), while values for C-c and C-i in hypersaline plants were 78 and 212 mmol mol(-1), respectively. Reductions in C-c would enhance rates of photorespiration relative to assimilation, with the higher photorespiratory rates being sufficient to account for apparent excess electron transport rates.

AB North American freshwater bivalves of the families Unionidae and Margaritiferidae represent one of the endangered faunas of the world. Effective management of threatened and endangered species requires knowledge not only of abundances of these species but also the degree of variation within species and the geographic distribution of this intraspecific variation. We used allozyme electrophoresis to examine the genetic structure of seven Quadrula quadrula populations from the Ohio, Tennessee, and Tensas Rivers. We then considered the implications of our results for the development of effective bivalve conservation strategies. Descriptive measures of genetic variation within populations are quite high (2.1 +/-: 0.1(se) alleles per locus; 61.4 +/- 2.6% polymorphic loci; 0.24 +/-0.01 heterozygosity) relative to other unionids. Genotype frequencies met Hardy-Weinberg expectations at all polymorphic loci. Among-population variation was low and mostly confined to differences between the Tensas River population (lower Mississippi River basin) and the Ohio River basin populations. Significant differences in allele frequencies among populations were only detected at 3 of 10 loci; no differences in allele frequencies were found among Ohio River basin populations. Genetic distances, though all small, were significantly correlated with geographic distance. Estimated gene flow was high among populations, but variation among populations did tend to follow the predictions of an isolation-by-distance model of dispersal. The low levels of among-population genetic variation are remarkable given that these populations are separated by distances as great as 2,500+ river kilometers. High levels of gene flow may ensure that within-population variation remains high and that populations do not become differentiated due to genetic drift. An optimum conservation strategy for this species in the mainstem of the Ohio River would center on the protection of a number of large populations and maintenance of corridors for dispersal of host fishes. Successful protection of threatened and endangered species requires conservation of both abundance and genetic diversity of unionids. Further work is needed to characterize general patterns of genetic structure within freshwater bivalve species.

TI Loblolly pine root growth and distribution under water stress
SO SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL

DT Article
ID MOISTURE
AB A rhizotron study was conducted to assess the relationship between soil water availability and shoot and root growth of loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) under conditions where O-2 availability and mechanical resistance were considered not limiting. Relationships between soil water availability and (i) root growth rate, (ii) root distribution, (iii) growth periodicity, and (iv) above- and belowground allocation were evaluated under four watering regimes ranging from maintaining profile near field rapacity (WK 1) to withholding moisture for 4 wk (WK 4). The final distribution of cumulative root growth was similar among watering treatments, even though root growth shifted downward with depth during the growing period due to water depletion in surface soils. Relative root elongation rates were found to be linearly related to soil water potential. The strength of this relationship was improved by considering only periods of active root growth. Reductions in above- and belowground growth were proportional among water-restricting treatments. Stem volume and root growth in the driest treatments were reduced 46 and 41%, respectively, compared with the WK 1 cells, indicating that patterns of biomass allocation above and below ground were similar among treatments. In the absence of other limiting soil factors, flushes of root growth in this study were a function of relatively short-term changes in soil water potential. Our results indicate that when maximum tree biomass is desired, management efforts in establishing pine should be aimed at reducing any restrictions to root growth during establishment.

AB The feeding apparatus of many marine molluscan herbivores leaves distinctive marks on the surface of dental wax. This method can be used in the held to assess the spatial and temporal patterns of gastropod grazing on rocky shores. Among the common gastropod grazers of intertidal habitats on the Isle of Man, distinctive rasping marks were made by docoglossan (Patella vulgata L.), rhipidoglossan (Calliostoma zizyphinum L. and Gibbula spp.) and larger taenioglossan (Littorina obtusata L.) grazers. Our technique for the field deployment of wax surfaces is simple, inexpensive, and permits a realistic placement of the wax surface in the environment. This placement is achieved by casting the wax into small discs (14 mm diameter) and setting them into pre-formed holes in the rock surface. By quantifying either the number of discs scraped or the area of the wax surface scraped, patterns of grazing intensity (defined as areal extent of the surface grazed in a given period) can be assessed over a variety of spatial and temporal scales. To illustrate this method and refine its use, we recorded the grazing patterns of the limper Patella vulgata for periods from 12 h to 17 days. The optimal period of deployment depended on the specific habitat, but we often found periods of 1-14 days to be appropriate. Regular arrays of discs also demonstrated that grazing intensity was spatially variable at a scale of 0.25 m, and that grazing intensity increased throughout the late winter and spring. This method provides a cheap and direct measure of feeding intensity that is directly relevant to understanding the effect of grazing molluscs on algal communities. Moreover, it can be used over a variety of spatial and temporal scales. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB It is known that the coffee (Coffea arabica L.) plant which is originally from shade habitats would have a limited ability to grow under full sun. Previous work has shown that nitrogen fertilisation can reduce the leaf damage when the plants are exposed to high light intensities during several days. In the present work we aimed to study the effects of the high irradiance during the first hours and evaluate the positive contribution of nitrogen fertilisation in the case of short-term exposure to strong light. Young plants (1.5-2 years old) grown in 1.5 kg of a mixed soil were supplemented with a nutrient solution containing 15 mM nitrogen in the form of NH4NO3, every 7 days (2N treatment), 15 days (1N treatment) and 45 days (0N treatment). Top mature leaves were exposed to a photosynthetic photon flux density of 1500 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) for a maximal period of 8 h, and changes in photosynthesis and pigment composition were monitored along the period of high light exposure. Photosynthetic capacity, leaf conductance to water vapour, electron transport capacity and maximum carboxylation activity, as well as some leaf fluorescence parameters (minimal fluorescence, photochemical efficiency of PSII and quantum yield of photosynthetic electron transport) were reduced by the stress, with a generally stronger impact observed in the ON plants. The photochemical quenching was affected only in the ON plants, while the non-photochemical quenching increased in 2N plants but decreased in the ON ones. The results showed that 2N plants presented a better initial status of the photosynthetic parameters and of the content of photoprotective pigments. Those plants showed ability to trigger some protective mechanisms, as observed by the tendency to increase the xanthophyll pool content, specially in zeaxanthin and in non-photochemical quenching. Also, protein content presented a tendency to increase after 1.5 h, which was maintained until the end of the high light period, We conclude that nitrogen availability is a key factor in the acclimation process to high light.

AB Light saturated photosynthesis (A) in field saplings of shade tolerant, intermediate, and intolerant tree species was analyzed for stomatal and nonstomatal limitations to test differences between species and sun and shade phenotypes during drought. Throughout the study, photosynthesis was highest and mesophyll limitations of A (L(m)) lowest in the intolerant species in both open and understory habitats. The shade tolerant species exhibited the only drought-related decreased A and increased L(m) in the open, and the greatest drought-related decreased A and increased L(m) in the understory. Few species exhibited significant habitat or drought-related differences in stomatal conductance to CO2 (g(c)), but even slight decreases in g(c) during drought were associated with large increases in stomatal limitations to A (L(g)). Combined changes in L(m) and L(g) resulted in increased relative stomatal limitation to A (l(g)) in several species during drought. Nevertheless, the overall lack of stomatal closure allowed for nonstomatal limitations to play a major role in reduced A during drought. Higher leaf N was associated with shallower slope of the l(g) versus g(c) relationship, an indication of greater A capacity. Photosynthetic capacity tended to be greater in the intolerant species than the tolerant species, and it tended to decrease during drought primarily in the shade tolerant species in the understory. Findings in the literature suggest that carbon reduction reactions may be more susceptible to drought than photosynthetic light reactions. If so, reduced carbon reduction capacity of shade tolerant species or shade phenotypes may predispose them to drought conditions, which suggests a mechanism behind the well-recognized tradeoff between drought tolerance and shade tolerance of temperate tree species.

AB Doubling the atmospheric CO2 concentration from 350 to 700 mu l l(-1) increased the relative growth rate (RGR) of hydroponically grown Urtica dioica L. and Plantago major ssp. pleiosperma Pilger only for the first 10-14 days. Previous experiments with P. major led to the conclusion that RGR did not respond in proportion to the rate of photosynthesis. The present paper is focussed on the analysis of the impact of changes in leaf morphology, dry matter partitioning, dry matter chemical composition and ontogenetic drift on this discrepancy.
   Soon after the start of the treatment, carbohydrate concentrations were higher at elevated CO2; a reaction that was largely due to starch accumulation. An increase in the percentage of leaf dry matter and decreases in the specific leaf area (SLA) and the shoot nitrogen concentration were correlated with an increase in the total nonstructural carbohydrate concentration (TNC). A combination of accumulation of soluble sugars and starch and ontogenetic drift explains the decrease in SLA at the elevated CO2 level. A similar ontogenetic effect of elevated CO2 was observed on the specific root length (SRL). Other variables such as shoot nitrogen concentration and percentage leaf dry matter were not affected by correction of data for TNC levels. The net diurnal fluctuation of the carbohydrate pool in P. major was equal for both CO2 concentrations, indicating that the growth response to elevated CO2 may be ruled by variables other than photosynthesis, as for instance sink strength.
   Elevated CO2 did not greatly influence the partitioning of nitrogen between soluble and insoluble, reduced N and nitrate, nor the allocation of dry matter between leaf, stem and root. The finding that the root to shoot ratio (R/S) was not affected by elevated CO2 implies that, in order to maintain a balanced activity between roots and shoot, no shift in partitioning of dry matter upon doubling of the atmospheric CO2 concentration is required. Our data on R/S are in good agreement with the response of R/S to high CO2 predicted by models based on such a theorem.

AB Short-term effects of benomyl on the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus Glomus caledonium (Nicol. & Gerd.) Trappe and Gerdeman associated with Cucumis sativus L. were studied by measuring effects on fungal P transport and on fungal alkaline phosphatase activity. Mycorrhizal plants were grown in three-compartment systems where nylon mesh was used to separate a root-free hyphal compartment (HC) and a root + hyphal compartment (RHC) from the main root compartment (RC). Non-mycorrhizal control plants were grown in similar growth units. After 6 wk benomyl was applied to the plants in three ways: as soil drenches to RHC or HC, or as a spray to the leaves, Benomyl was added in three concentrations. Equal amounts of P-32 and P-33 were added to the HC and to the RHC respectively, immediately after the application of benomyl. Plants were harvested 4-6 d later. Hyphal transport of P-32 from the HC was inhibited when benomyl was applied to the HC at 10 mu g g(-1) soil, whereas the uptake of P-33 from RHC (roots + hyphae) was reduced only at the highest dose of application to the RHC (100 mu g g(-1) soil). In contrast to the marked reduction of benomyl on fungal P transport, the activity of fungal alkaline phosphatase inside the roots was unaffected by benomyl.

AB Twelve-week-old seedlings of Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst), non-mycorrhizal or mycorrhizal with Laccaria laccata, Paxillus involutus or Pisolithus tinctorius were exposed to 5 mu M Pb for either 32 or 42 days in a quartz sand-nutrient solution system. Ultrathin sections of mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal short roots were examined by X-ray microanalysis. After 42 days Pb treatment, the Pb content of the cortex cell walls was lower in the non-mycorrhizal short roots and in the P. involutus mycorrhizae than in the mycorrhizae of L. laccata or P. tinctorius. The Pb content of the cell walls of the hyphal mantle was higher in P. involutus than in L. laccata or P. tinctorius. The short term experiment over 32 days showed that the Pb content of the cortex cell walls strongly increased during the first 16 days in the non-mycorrhizal roots and the L. laccata mycorrhizae, whereas it increased more slowly in the P. involutus mycorrhizae. After 32 days Pb treatment, the Pb content in the cortex cell walls in the P. involutus mycorrhizae was similar to that in the non-mycorrhizal roots. P. involutus also decreased Pb translocation from the roots to the stems. Mycorrhizal infection was not affected by Pb but with P. involutus, the amount of extramatrical mycelium was reduced by 50% on day 32 compared to day 16. The extramatrical mycelium of L. laccata was not reduced by Pb. It is concluded that ectomycorrhizal fungi differ in their effect on Pb accumulation in the roots of Norway spruce. The binding capacity of the extramatrical mycelium seems to be an important factor.

AB We examined if higher plant water use efficiency is related to a higher investment of nitrogen in components of the photosynthetic apparatus and if this is associated with a less efficient use of nitrogen for photosynthesis or for growth, We also assessed the influence of a reduced supply of water and nitrogen on these relationships, For this purpose we used two Triticum aestivum cultivars, differing in whole plant water use efficiency,
   Differences in leaf water use efficiency (A/E) between cultivars or treatments were associated with differences in Rubisco activity or rate of electron transport and, in general, with differences in plant water use efficiency, They were not invariably related to a low photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency (PNUE), A high A/E was associated with a low PNUE, e.g, when we compared cultivars at high irradiance. In this case, a high A/E and a high leaf nitrogen concentration were associated with a low stomatal conductance and an equal rate of photosynthesis, A high A/E was not associated with a low PNUE when differences in A/E were mainly caused by higher rates of photosynthesis associated with higher nitrogen concentrations, e,g, when we compared cultivars at low irradiance and high water and nitrogen supply. An increase in the proportion of total leaf nitrogen associated with the photosynthetic apparatus at low soil-nitrogen increased PNUE, without affecting A/E in the opposite way, We conclude that whole plant nitrogen use efficiency was low for the cultivars with a high plant water use efficiency.

AB Seven annual-perennial pairs of grass species (six congeneric and one pair taken at random) were grown under productive conditions in the laboratory in order to investigate which plant characters were responsible for the higher relative growth rate (RGR) of annuals as compared to perennials under these conditions. The nitrogen and carbon concentrations of shoot organs and of the whole plant were higher in annuals than in perennials. This was also the case for the specific absorption rate for nitrate and nitrogen productivity (on whole plant and leaf basis). The range of RGR displayed by the 14 species was large enough (0.15-0.33 d-1) to examine the general relationships between RGR and the various parameters measured in the present study. RGR was positively related to plant, leaf blade and sheath nitrogen concentrations, but there was no relationship between RGR and any of the carbon concentrations. RGR also strongly correlated with specific absorption rate for nitrate and with nitrogen productivity. A new factorization of this latter parameter led to the definition of the 'leaf nitrogen productivity' (N(L)P), which is likely to depend on photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency. RGR was shown to be strongly correlated with N(L)P, but not with the second term of the factorization, namely the proportion of plant nitrogen allocated to the leaves.

AB In many productive terrestrial biomes there seems to be an abundance of forage which is not exploited by herbivores. This observation has generated several hypotheses. One set of hypotheses suggests that the herbivores are either regulated by predators, social interactions or pathogens, and that the abundant plant biomass is an effect of relatively low herbivore densities and a low grazing pressure. The other set claims that the quality of the bulk of the vegetation is persistently too low to give herbivores positive energy or nutrient balance. The herbivores should be critically dependent on high-quality plants or plant organs, but the bulk of the vegetation will remain untouched. The herbivores should thus live in a ''green desert''. The first set assumes that an plants are edible and of sufficiently high quality, while the second set assumes that plants are generally toxic or of low quality. We have tested this assumption with microtine rodents and productive boreal field layer vegetation in a greenhouse experiment. We found that for three of the studied vole species, Microtus agrestis, Clethrionomys rufocanus, and C. glareolus, the vegetation became severely damaged before the individual voles started to lose weight. On average, 10% of the vegetation remained compared with ungrazed controls. Shoot mortality for toxic tall herbs was almost as high as for corresponding non-toxic species. Toxic species also showed a low ability to recover from damage one year after grazing. Toxicity was thus only marginally successful in protecting plants against grazing. We concluded that the first set of hypotheses thus seemed to be built on a more realistic assumption than the second set. Long-term effects after the grazing had ended showed that herbs generally suffered while grasses were favoured, regardless whether the voles preferred herbs or grasses. This suggests that the graminoid strategy is superior in dealing with pulsatory grazing.

AB The aim of the present study was to investigate possible differences in plasticity between a potentially fast-growing and a potentially slow-growing grass species. To this end, Holcus lanatus (L.) and Deschampsia flexuosa (L.) Trin., associated with fertile and infertile habitats, respectively, were grown in sand at eight nitrate concentrations. When plants obtained a fresh weight of approximately 5 g, biomass allocation, specific leaf area, the rate of net photosynthesis, the organic nitrogen concentration of various plant parts and the root weight at different soil depths were determined. There were linear relationships between the morphological and physiological features studied and the In-transformed nitrate concentration supplied, except for the specific leaf area and root nitrogen concentration of H. lanatus, which did not respond to the nitrate concentration. The root biomass of H. lanatus was invariably more evenly distributed over the soil layers than that of D. flexuosa. However, D. flexuosa allocated more root biomass to lower soil depths with decreasing nitrate concentration, in contrast to H. lanatus, which did not respond. The relative response to nitrate supply, i.e. the value of a character at a certain nitrate level relative to the value of that character at the highest nitrate supply, was used as a measure for plasticity. For a number of parameters (leaf area ratio, root weight ratio, root nitrogen concentration, vertical root biomass distribution and rate of net photosynthesis pei unit leaf weight) the potentially slow-growing D. flexuosa exhibited a higher phenotypic plasticity than the potentially fast-growing H. lanatus. These findings are in disagreement with current literature. Possible explanations for this discrepancy are discussed in terms of differences in experimental approach as well as fundamental differences in specific traits between fast- and slow-growing grasses.

AB This study examines how larval dispersal and habitat-specific variation in life-history characteristics shape the vertical distribution of a colonial ascidian, Diplosoma similis. Measurements were made of the pattern of larval dispersal, the distribution of larval settlers and adults, and the growth, fecundity, and survival rate of adults within four habitat zones on a coral reef. Results suggest that larvae tend to disperse unidirectionally up the reef slope and that the peak in the distribution of adults at the reef crest is at least partly a product of this unidirectional pattern of larval dispersal and differential growth. Because of disturbances such as rainstorms, the peak in the distribution of adults periodically shifts to depths lower than 4 m and then between disturbances probably returns to the reef crest as a result of larval dispersal. It is argued that, at spatial scales greater than the average distance larvae disperse, the population dynamics of this ascidian and perhaps other sessile marine invertebrates with restricted larval dispersal are probably best simulated by modified "patch" models that assume that the local environment is spatially heterogeneous, and migration occurs indirectly from nearby habitats through a spatially partitioned bath.

AB Effects of nitrogen fertilization on growth, foliar nitrogen concentration, and monoterpenes were determined on 7- to 11-year-old jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.) on two sites in northwestern Wisconsin. One site established after wildfire; the other after claar-cutting. Jack pine budworm (Choristoneura pinus pinus Free.) larvae were caged on fertilized and unfertilized trees on each site. Relations among foliar nitrogen, monoterpenes, larval survival, and adult budworm weight were examined. Foliar nitrogen concentration, needle weight, shoot and diameter growth, and monoterpene production were lower on wildfire site trees than on clear-cut site trees, and were significantly increased on both sites by fertilization. Fertilization increased production of staminate cones on the wildfire site. Height growth differed between sites but was unaffected by fertilization. Contrary to expectations based on the resource availability theory, foliar nitrogen and monoterpene levels were positively related. Survival of jack pine budworm larvae was greater on clear-cut than on wildfire site trees, but was not significantly affected by fertilization. Larvae on low-nitrogen trees on the wildfire site clipped more foliage than those on the clear-cut site, suggesting compensatory feeding. Adult female weight was higher for larvae on wildfire than clear-cut site trees. Two monoterpene compounds and site-related differences were the best predictors of adult female weight based on regression.

AB Horizontal and vertical root mapping was used to relate rooting to a structured soil environment.  Selected horizontal planes and associated vertical walls were exposed, and root locations were marked on polyethylene sheets.  Separate sheets were used to indicate pores and cracks.  Image analysis of the marked sheets indicated location of each root and root number per unit area (N).  Number of roots growing in pores and cracks was determined by alignment of the marked sheets.  Sixteen undisturbed cores (118 cm3) were taken in a grid pattern from each Ap horizon and adjacent subsoil for determination of root length density (D).  Root clustering was associated with high coefficients of variation (ranging from 27 to 102%) for D.  D/N (number-1) ratios were 16 (much greater than the theoretical value of 2 for a random root system).  Both root branching and location of plant rows caused root clustering.  Most of the root mappings were considered clustered by distributional statistics methods.  Only a small percentage of roots were growing in preexisting pores and cracks, but many roots were located on ped faces.

AB Plant trait variation drives plant function, community composition and ecosystem processes. However, our current understanding of trait variation disproportionately relies on aboveground observations. Here we integrate root traits into the global framework of plant form and function. We developed and tested an overarching conceptual framework that integrates two recently identified root trait gradients with a well-established aboveground plant trait framework. We confronted our novel framework with published relationships between above- and belowground trait analogues and with multivariate analyses of above- and belowground traits of 2510 species. Our traits represent the leaf and root conservation gradients (specific leaf area, leaf and root nitrogen concentration, and root tissue density), the root collaboration gradient (root diameter and specific root length) and the plant size gradient (plant height and rooting depth). We found that an integrated, whole-plant trait space required as much as four axes. The two main axes represented the fast-slow 'conservation' gradient on which leaf and fine-root traits were well aligned, and the 'collaboration' gradient in roots. The two additional axes were separate, orthogonal plant size axes for height and rooting depth. This perspective on the multidimensional nature of plant trait variation better encompasses plant function and influence on the surrounding environment.

AB Unprecedented rates of introduction and spread of non-native species pose burgeoning challenges to biodiversity, natural resource management, regional economies, and human health. Current biosecurity efforts are failing to keep pace with globalization, revealing critical gaps in our understanding and response to invasions. Here, we identify four priority areas to advance invasion science in the face of rapid global environmental change. First, invasion science should strive to develop a more comprehensive framework for predicting how the behavior, abundance, and interspecific interactions of non-native species vary in relation to conditions in receiving environments and how these factors govern the ecological impacts of invasion. A second priority is to understand the potential synergistic effects of multiple co-occurring stressors- particularly involving climate change-on the establishment and impact of non-native species. Climate adaptation and mitigation strategies will need to consider the possible consequences of promoting non-native species, and appropriate management responses to non-native species will need to be developed. The third priority is to address the taxonomic impediment. The ability to detect and evaluate invasion risks is compromised by a growing deficit in taxonomic expertise, which cannot be adequately compensated by new molecular technologies alone. Management of biosecurity risks will become increasingly challenging unless academia, industry, and governments train and employ new personnel in taxonomy and systematics. Fourth, we recommend that internationally cooperative biosecurity strategies consider the bridgehead effects of global dispersal networks, in which organisms tend to invade new regions from locations where they have already established. Cooperation among countries to eradicate or control species established in bridgehead regions should yield greater benefit than independent attempts by individual countries to exclude these species from arriving and establishing.

TI PROSPECT-PRO for estimating content of nitrogen-containing leaf proteins
   and other carbon-based constituents

AB Models of radiative transfer (RT) are important tools for remote sensing of vegetation, allowing for forward simulations of remotely sensed data as well as inverse estimation of biophysical and biochemical traits from vegetation optical properties. Estimation of foliar protein content is the key to monitor the nitrogen cycle in terrestrial ecosystems, in particular to assess the photosynthetic capacity of plants and to improve nitrogen management in agriculture. However, until now physically based leaf RT models have not allowed for proper spectral decomposition and estimation of leaf dry matter as nitrogen-based proteins and other carbon-based constituents (CBC) from optical properties of fresh and dry foliage. Such an achievement is the key for subsequent upscaling to canopy level and for development of new Earth observation applications.
   Therefore, we developed a new version of the PROSPECT model, named PROSPECT-PRO, which separates the nitrogen-based constituents (proteins) from CBC (including cellulose, lignin, hemicellulose, starch and sugars). PROSPECT-PRO was calibrated and validated on subsets of the LOPEX dataset, accounting for both fresh and dry broadleaf and grass samples. We applied an iterative model inversion optimization algorithm and identified the optimal spectral ranges for retrieval of proteins and CBC. When combining leaf reflectance and transmittance within the selected optimal spectral domains, PROSPECT-PRO inversions revealed similarly accurate CBC estimates of fresh and dry leaf samples (respective validation R-2 = 0.96 and 0.95, NRMSE = 9.6% and 13.4%), whereas a better performance was obtained for fresh than for dry leaves when estimating proteins (respective validation R-2 = 0.79 and 0.57, NRMSE = 15.1% and 26.1%). The accurate estimation of leaf constituents for fresh samples is attributed to the optimal spectral feature selection procedure.
   We further tested the ability of PROSPECT-PRO to estimate leaf mass per area (LMA) as the sum of proteins and CBC using independent datasets acquired for numerous plant species. Results showed that both PROSPECT PRO and PROSPECT-D inversions were able to produce comparable LMA estimates across an independent dataset gathering 1685 leaf samples (validation R-2 = 0.90 and NRMSE = 16.5% for PROSPECT-PRO, and R-2 = 0.90 and NRMSE =18.3% for PROSPECT-D). Findings also revealed that PROSPECT-PRO is capable of assessing the carbon-to-nitrogen ratio based on the retrieved CBC-to-proteins ratio (R-2 = 0.87 and NRMSE = 15.7% for fresh leaves, and R-2 = 0.65 and NRMSE= 28.1% for dry leaves). The performance assessment of newly designed PROSPECT-PRO demonstrates a promising potential for its involvement in precision agriculture and ecological applications aiming at estimation of leaf carbon and nitrogen contents from observations of current and forthcoming airborne and satellite imaging spectroscopy sensors.

AB Balancing trade-off between multiple ecosystem services (ESs) is critical for restored ecosystem, including in the Loess Plateau of China where ESs are undergoing significant changes. In this study, the ESs were quantified by specialized models in Ansai watershed from 2000 to 2014, and regression and redundancy analysis were used to reveal the effects of selected key drivers on ESs and their trade-offs. The results were as follows: (1) soil erosion control (SEC) and carbon sequestration (TC) increased by 17.8% and 82.1%, while water yield (WY) declined by 37.6%. (2) Forest and shrub land are shared drivers, and slope gradient, grassland and construction land were independent drivers. Slope gradient and grassland had a dominant influence on SEC-WY trade-off in 2014. Quadratic function relationship can be found between slope gradient and trade-off. Moreover, reducing forest and expanding grassland can restrain trade-off. (3) There is a unidirectional interaction between TC and WY. Rainfall, grassland, farmland, and forest land are shared drivers. Rainfall and forest aggravated trade-off but grassland restrained tradeoff. Whereas construction land is independent driver. The forest and grassland proportion are dominant drivers affecting TC-WY trade-off in 2014. Quadratic function relationship also can be found between trade-off and forest and grassland. (3) Overall, forest and grassland proportions need to be controlled at 20-30% and 45-60% respectively. We proposed the mode of ecological restoration: taking the contiguous grassland as the matrix, in which the small forest patch with more edges can be set. Our study provides a better understanding for driving mechanism of ESs trade-offs. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The speciation of arsenic controls its mobility and bioavailability and therefore its entry into the food chain. Inorganic and methylated oxyarsenic species have been a focus of research, but arsenic characterization in the field has largely ignored thioarsenates, in which sulfur takes the place of oxygen. Here, on the basis of field, mesocosm and soil incubation studies across multiple paddy soils from rice cultivation areas in Italy, France and China, we find that thioarsenates are important arsenic species in paddy-soil pore waters. We observed thioarsenates throughout the cropping season, with concentrations comparable to the much-better-investigated methylated oxyarsenates. Anaerobic soil incubations confirmed a large potential for thiolation across a wide diversity of paddy soil types in different climate zones and with different parent materials. In these incubations, inorganic thioarsenates occurred predominantly where soil pH exceeded 6.5 and in the presence of zero-valent sulfur. Methylated thioarsenates occurred predominantly at soil pH below 7 and in the presence of their precursors, methylated oxyarsenates. High concentrations of dissolved iron limited arsenic thiolation. Sulfate fertilization increased thioarsenate formation. It is currently unclear whether thiolation is good or bad for rice consumption safety. Nevertheless, we highlight thiolation as an important factor to arsenic biogeochemistry in rice paddies.
   Thioarsenates are found in the pore waters of rice paddy fields, comparable in concentration to methylated oxyarsenates, according to field, mesocosm and soil incubation studies.

AB Most studies on the biological effects of future climatic changes rely on seasonally aggregated, coarse-resolution data. Such data mask spatial and temporal variability in microclimate driven by terrain, wind and vegetation, and ultimately bear little resemblance to the conditions that organisms experience in the wild. Here, I present the methods for providing fine-grained, hourly and daily estimates of current and future temperature and soil moisture over decadal timescales. Observed climate data and spatially coherent probabilistic projections of daily future weather were disaggregated to hourly and used to drive empirically calibrated physical models of thermal and hydrological microclimates. Mesoclimatic effects (cold-air drainage, coastal exposure and elevation) were determined from the coarse-resolution climate surfaces using thin-plate spline models with coastal exposure and elevation as predictors. Differences between micro and mesoclimate temperatures were determined from terrain, vegetation and ground properties using energy balance equations. Soil moisture was computed in a thin upper layer and an underlying deeper layer, and the exchange of water between these layers was calculated using the van Genuchten equation. Code for processing the data and running the models is provided as a series of R packages. The methods were applied to the Lizard Peninsula, United Kingdom, to provide hourly estimates of temperature (100 m grid resolution over entire area, 1 m for a selected area) for the periods 1983-2017 and 2041-2049. Results indicated that there is a fine-resolution variability in climatic changes, driven primarily by interactions between landscape features and decadal trends in weather conditions. High-temporal resolution extremes in conditions under future climate change were predicted to be considerably less novel than the extremes estimated using seasonally aggregated variables. The study highlights the need to more accurately estimate the future climatic conditions experienced by organisms and equips biologists with the means to do so.

AB Like all other plants, trees are vulnerable to attack by a multitude of pests and pathogens. Current control measures for many of these diseases are limited and relatively ineffective. Several methods, including the use of conventional synthetic agro-chemicals, are employed to reduce the impact of pests and diseases. However, because of mounting concerns about adverse effects on the environment and a variety of economic reasons, this limited management of tree diseases by chemical methods is losing ground. The use of biological control, as a more environmentally friendly alternative, is becoming increasingly popular in plant protection. This can include the deployment of soil inoculants and foliar sprays, but the increased knowledge of microbial ecology in the phytosphere, in particular phylloplane microbes and endophytes, has stimulated new thinking for biocontrol approaches. Endophytes are microbes that live within plant tissues. As such, they hold potential as biocontrol agents against plant diseases because they are able to colonize the same ecological niche favoured by many invading pathogens. However, the development and exploitation of endophytes as biocontrol agents will have to overcome numerous challenges. The optimization and improvement of strategies employed in endophyte research can contribute towards discovering effective and competent biocontrol agents. The impact of environment and plant genotype on selecting potentially beneficial and exploitable endophytes for biocontrol is poorly understood. How endophytes synergise or antagonise one another is also an important factor. This review focusses on recent research addressing the biocontrol of plant diseases and pests using endophytic fungi and bacteria, alongside the challenges and limitations encountered and how these can be overcome. We frame this review in the context of tree pests and diseases, since trees are arguably the most difficult plant species to study, work on and manage, yet they represent one of the most important organisms on Earth.

AB Quantifying "demographic independence" is a vital step in establishing potential conservation units for a species in that it effectively distinguishes migration from within-population reproduction. This is an important aspect because it allows for an accurate estimate of recruitment. For example, populations may be designated as 'management units' (=MUs) if indeed population growth results from local demography rather than immigration. Of additional interest is the calculation of immigrant ancestry and ascertainment of the temporal context over which immigration occurred. This is because MUs depend largely upon local (self-sustaining) birth and death rates, and the quantification of ancestry is necessary to validate demographic independence. Dispersal rate is also of immediate interest to conservation biologists, and can be assessed by quantifying genetic divergence among populations. The capacity with which to gauge these benchmarks has now been extended herein to genome-wide molecular data, in an attempt to adjust an analytical tool that was until now intractable for the next generation sequencing data. In this study, a popular legacy program for migrant detection (i.e. BayesAss3) has been modified to accept SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) data. We validated BA3-SNPs using empirical data to demonstrate its suitability for both high-performance and desktop computing environments. We also facilitate high analytical throughput by presenting a binary search algorithm that automates MCMC (Markov chain Monte Carlo) parameter tuning. Our BA3-SNPs-autotune program required five or fewer rounds of optimization for 99% of input files, with acceptable mixing parameters derived in 100% of our test cases. Runtime for BA3-SNPs is a function of the number of loci analysed. Benchmarking yielded an average runtime <32 hr (10 million MCMC generations) for datasets containing thousands of SNPs. The BA3 algorithm remains a viable option for analysing modern SNP datasets.

AB The contradiction between "high yielding" and "early maturing" hampers further improvement of annual rice yield. Here we report the positional cloning of a major maturity duration regulatory gene, Early flowering-completely dominant (Ef-cd), and demonstrate that natural variation in Ef-cd could be used to overcome the above contradictory. The Ef-cd locus gives rise to a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) antisense transcript overlapping the OsSOC1 gene. Ef-cd lncRNA expression positively correlates with the expression of OsSOC1 and H3K36me3 deposition. Field test comparisons of early maturing Ef-cd near-isogenic lines with their wild types as well as of the derivative early maturing hybrids with their wild-type hybrids conducted under different latitudes determined that the early maturing Ef-cd allele shortens maturity duration (ranging from 7 to 20 d) without a concomitant yield penalty. Ef-cd facilitates nitrogen utilization and also improves the photosynthesis rate. Analysis of 1,439 elite hybrid rice varieties revealed that the 16 homozygotes and 299 heterozygotes possessing Ef-cd matured significantly earlier. Therefore, Ef-cd could be a vital contributor of elite early maturing hybrid varieties in balancing grain yield with maturity duration.

AB This review provides an overview and integration of the use of resilience concepts to guide natural resources management actions. We emphasize ecosystems and landscapes and provide examples of the use of these concepts from empirical research in applied ecology. We begin with a discussion of definitions and concepts of ecological resilience and related terms that are applicable to management. We suggest that a resilience-based framework for management facilitates regional planning by providing the ability to locate management actions where they will have the greatest benefits and determine effective management strategies. We review the six key components of a resilience-based framework, beginning with managing for adaptive capacity and selecting an appropriate spatial extent and grain. Critical elements include developing an understanding of the factors influencing the general and ecological resilience of ecosystems and landscapes, the landscape context and spatial resilience, pattern and process interactions and their variability, and relationships among ecological and spatial resilience and the capacity to support habitats and species. We suggest that a spatially explicit approach, which couples geospatial information on general and spatial resilience to disturbance with information on resources, habitats, or species, provides the foundation for resilience-based management. We provide a case study from the sagebrush biome that illustrates the use of geospatial information on ecological and spatial resilience for prioritizing management actions and determine effective strategies.

AB Vegetation restoration has long been considered as an effective strategy for soil conservation in many hilly regions, which can lead to a significant increase in vegetation coverage. The aim of this paper was to quantify the effect of changes in vegetation coverage on soil erosion control in the red soil hilly region of China. Based on a literature review, a database was collected from 35 typical small watersheds. The database covered extensive geographical locations, including 6 provinces and 1 autonomous region of China, with vegetation coverage ranging from 8% to 96%, and the soil erosion modulus ranging from 67 to 13,000 t.km(-2).a(-1). The results confirmed that vegetation coverage significantly and positively affected soil loss. It also indicated that there is a threshold phenomenon between vegetation coverage and soil loss. The vegetation coverage in the small watersheds could be divided into three threshold zones: the lower threshold (0-40%), the transition zone (40-80%), and the upper threshold (80-100%). In these zones, the vegetation soil conservation efficiency and its changing rates were unlike. Thus, different vegetation restoration strategies should be adopted in these zones. In the lower threshold, it is suitable to adopt artificial restoration; in the upper threshold, natural recovery is more reasonable; and in the transition zone, combination of artificial and natural restoration is preferable. This study revealed the vegetation coverage threshold values and the corresponding restoration strategies with respect to soil erosion control at the region scale, which serve as a scientific basis for decision makers.

AB Sustainability science is a use-inspired and place-based transdisciplinary enterprise that integrates natural and social sciences, engineering/design sciences, and humanities to produce actionable knowledge for improving human wellbeing while maintaining long-term environmental integrity. Regional landscapes represent a pivotal scale domain for studying and practicing sustainability because they integrate human-environment interactions, link local processes below and global patterns above, and provide a common platform for scientists, land designers/planners, policymakers, and stakeholders to collaborate on sustainability issues that resonate with all. An interdisciplinary confluence of ecological, geographical, and design/planning sciences is underway, but how this confluence can effectively contribute to the science and practice of sustainability is yet to be explored. Here I review landscape and land system-based approaches, including land change science, land system science, land system architecture, landscape ecology, landscape sustainability science, and geodesign, and discuss why and how they can be linked for achieving the common goal of sustainability.

AB Scientists and decision-makers need tools that can assess which specific pressures lead to ecosystem deterioration, and which measures could reduce these pressures and/or limit their effects. In this context, species distribution models are tools that can be used to help asses these pressures. Evolutionary algorithms represent a collection of promising techniques, inspired by concepts observed in natural evolution, to support the development of species distribution models. They are suited to solve non-trivial tasks, such as the calibration of parameter-rich models, the reduction of model complexity by feature selection and/or the optimization of hyperparameters of other machine learning algorithms. Although widely used in other scientific domains, the full potential of evolutionary algorithms has yet to be explored for applied ecological research. In this synthesis, we study the role of evolutionary algorithms as a machine learning technique to develop the next generation of species distribution models. To do so, we review available methods for species distribution modelling and synthesize literature using evolutionary algorithms. In addition, we discuss specific advantages and weaknesses of evolutionary algorithms and present a guideline for their application. We find that evolutionary algorithms are increasingly used to solve specific and challenging problems. Their flexibility, adaptability and transferability in addition to their capacity to find adequate solutions to complex, non-linear problems are considered as main strengths, especially for species distribution models with a large degree of complexity. The need for programming and modelling skills can be considered as a drawback for novice modellers. In addition, setting values for hyperparameters is a challenge. Future ecological research should focus on exploring the potential of evolutionary algorithms that combine multiple tasks in one learning cycle. In addition, studies should focus on the use of novel machine learning schemes (e.g. automated hyperparameter optimization) to apply evolutionary algorithms, preferably in the context of open science. This way, ecologists and model developers can achieve an adaptable and flexible framework for developing tools useful for decision management.

AB Hypotheses that megafires, very large, high-impact fires, are caused by either climate effects such as drought or fuel accumulation due to fire exclusion with accompanying changes to forest structure have long been alleged and guided policy, but their physical basis remains untested. Here, unique airborne observations and microscale simulations using a coupled weather-wildland-fire-behavior model allowed a recent megafire, the King Fire, to be deconstructed and the relative impacts of forest structure, fuel load, weather, and drought on fire size, behavior, and duration to be separated. Simulations reproduced observed details including the arrival at an inclined canyon, a 25-km run, and later slower growth and features. Analysis revealed that fire-induced winds that equaled or exceeded ambient winds and fine-scale airflow undetected by surface weather networks were primarily responsible for the fire's rapid growth and size. Sensitivity tests varied fuel moisture and amount across wide ranges and showed that both drought and fuel accumulation effects were secondary, limited to sloped terrain where they compounded each other, and, in this case, unable to significantly impact the final extent. Compared to standard data, fuel models derived solely from remote sensing of vegetation type and forest structure improved simulated fire progression, notably in disturbed areas, and the distribution of burn severity. These results point to self-reinforcing internal dynamics rather than external forces as a means of generating this and possibly other outlier fire events. Hence, extreme fires need not arise from extreme fire environment conditions. Kinematic models used in operations do not capture fire-induced winds and dynamic feedbacks so can underestimate megafire events. The outcomes provided a nuanced view of weather, forest structure, fuel accumulation, and drought impacts on landscape-scale fire behaviorroles that can be misconstrued using correlational analyses between area burned and macroscale climate data or other exogenous factors. A practical outcome is that fuel treatments should be focused on sloped terrain, where factors multiply, for highest impact.

AB The vacuolar lytic degradation of proteins releases free amino acids that plants can use instead of sugars for respiratory energy production. Autophagy is a major cellular process leading to the transport of proteins into the vacuole for degradation. Here, we examine the contribution of autophagy to the amino acid metabolism response to sugar starvation in mature leaves of Arabidopsis thaliana. During sugar starvation arising from the exposure of wild-type (WT) plants to darkness, autophagic transport of chloroplast stroma, which contains most of the proteins in a leaf, into the vacuolar lumen was induced within 2 d. During this time, the level of soluble proteins, primarily Rubisco (ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase), decreased and the amount of free amino acid increased. In dark-treated autophagy-defective (atg) mutants, the decrease of soluble proteins was suppressed, which resulted in the compromised release of basic amino acids, branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) and aromatic amino acids. The impairment of BCAA catabolic pathways in the knockout mutants of the electron transfer flavoprotein (ETF)/ETF:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (etfqo) complex and the electron donor protein isovaleryl-CoA dehydrogenase (ivdh) caused a reduced tolerance to dark treatment similar to that in the atg mutants. The enhanced accumulation of BCAAs in the ivdh and etfqo mutants during the dark treatment was reduced by additional autophagy deficiency. These results indicate that vacuolar protein degradation via autophagy serves as an adaptive response to disrupted photosynthesis by providing substrates to amino acid catabolic pathways, including BCAA catabolism mediated by IVDH and ETFQO.

AB Phenology is a key feature in the description of species niches to capture seasonality in resource use and climate requirements. Species distribution models (SDMs) are widespread tools to evaluate a species' potential distribution and identify its large-scale habitat preferences. Despite its chief importance, data phenology is often neglected in SDM development. Non-migratory bats of temperate regions are good model species to test the effect of data seasonality on SDM outputs because of their different roosting preferences between hibernation and reproduction. We hypothesized that (1) the output of SDMs developed for six non-migratory European bat species will differ between hibernation and reproduction; (2) models built from datasets encompassing both ecological stages will perform better than seasonal models. We employed a dataset of 470 independent occurrences of bat hibernacula and 400 independent records of nursery roosts of selected species and for each species we developed separate winter, summer and mixed (i.e. generated from both winter and summer occurrences) models. Seasonal and mixed potential ranges differed from each other and the direction of this difference was species-specific. Mixed models outperformed seasonal models in representing species niches. Our work highlights the importance of considering data seasonality in the development of SDMs for bats as well as many other organisms, including non-migratory species, otherwise the analysis will lead to significant biases whose consequences for conservation planning and landscape management may be detrimental.

AB The redistribution of species has emerged as one of the most pervasive impacts of anthropogenic climate warming, and presents many societal challenges. Understanding how temperature regulates species distributions is particularly important for mobile marine fauna such as sharks given their seemingly rapid responses to warming, and the socio-political implications of human encounters with some dangerous species. The predictability of species distributions can potentially be improved by accounting for temperature's influence on performance, an elusive relationship for most large animals. We combined multi-decadal catch data and bio-logging to show that coastal abundance and swimming performance of tiger sharks Galeocerdo cuvier are both highest at similar to 22 degrees C, suggesting thermal constraints on performance may regulate this species' distribution. Tiger sharks are responsible for a large proportion of shark bites on humans, and a focus of controversial control measures in several countries. The combination of distribution and performance data moves towards a mechanistic understanding of tiger shark's thermal niche, and delivers a simple yet powerful indicator for predicting the location and timing of their occurrences throughout coastlines. For example, tiger sharks are mostly caught at Australia's popular New South Wales beaches (i.e. near Sydney) in the warmest months, but our data suggest similar abundances will occur in winter and summer if annual sea surface temperatures increase by a further 1-2 degrees C.

AB Previous studies have found biochar-induced effects on native soil organic carbon (NSOC) decomposition, with a range of positive, negative and no priming reported. However, many uncertainties still exist regarding which parameters drive the amplitude and the direction of the biochar priming.
   We conducted a quantitative analysis of 1170 groups of data from 27 incubation studies using boosted regression trees (BRTs). BRT is a machine learning method combining regression trees and a boosting algorithm, which can effectively partition independent influences of various factors on the target variable in the complex ecological processes.
   The BRT model explained a total of 72.4% of the variation in soil carbon (C) priming following biochar amendment, in which incubation conditions (36.5%) and biochar properties (33.7%) explained a larger proportion than soil properties (29.8%). The predictors that substantially accounted for the explained variation included incubation time (27.1%) and soil moisture (5.0%), biochar C/N ratio (6.2%), nitrogen content (5.5%), pyrolysis time during biochar production (5.1%), biochar pH (4.5%), soil C content (5.2%), sand (4.7%) and clay content (4.1%). In contrast, other incubation conditions (temperature, biochar dose, whether nutrient was added), biochar properties (biochar C, feedstock type, ash content, pyrolysis temperature, whether biochar was activated) and soil properties (nitrogen content, silt content, C/N ratio, pH, land use type) had small contribution (each < 4%). Positive priming occurred within the first 2 years of incubations, with a change to negative priming afterwards. The priming was negative for low N biochar or in high-moisture soils but positive on their reverse sides. The size of negative priming increased with rising biochar C/N ratio, pyrolysis time and soil clay content, but deceased with soil C/N ratio.
   We determine the critical drivers for biochar effect on native soil organic C cycling, which can help us to better predict soil C sequestration following biochar amendment.

AB Renewable energy is a global interest area in achieving sustainable development. Renewable energy sustainability has been assessed using the most commonly used dimensions of this concept: economic, environmental, social, and institutional dimensions. In this paper, we designed a composite index named the Renewable Energy Sustainability Index. The proposed index may represent a national monitoring mechanism that points out the strengths and weaknesses of a state in terms of renewable energy. The data were normalized by calculating the z-score. We tested the proposed index on a selection of 15 European countries ranked by final energy consumption and with different levels of development. The Kayser-Mayer-Olkin values were above the 0.700 limit, which indicates the robustness of each dimension. The proposed index reveals the development stages of renewable energy sustainability and can provide solutions to increase the sustainability of a country by improving positive impact indicators and mitigating negative impact indicators.

AB The leaf optical properties model PROSPECT has been widely used to retrieve foliar chemistry in reverse mode from directional-hemispherical reflectance factor (DHRF) spectra measured with integrating sphere equipped spectrometers. With bidirectional reflectance factor (BRF) spectra, some researchers attempted to invert PROSPECT after a modification to the latest version of the model. However, the retrieval accuracy varies greatly with chemical constituents and can be low for some of them, such as dry matter content. This paper proposes a new approach called PROCWT by coupling PROSPECT with continuous wavelet transform (CWT) to suppress the surface reflectance effect and enhance the absorption features of chemical constituents. Instead of the reflectance spectra, the wavelet coefficient spectra generated after CWT were used to construct the merit function for model inversion. Given that the multi-scale decomposition of CWT enables enhancement of chemical-specific absorption features, the use of PROCWT at different scales of wavelet decomposition could lead to improved retrievals of biochemical parameters. The performance of PROCWT was evaluated for estimating foliar chemicals of wheat and rice crops from BRF spectra measured with a leaf clip equipped spectrometer over a two-year field experiment. PROCWT was also compared with the standard PROSPECT inversion (STANDARD), the PROSPECT inversion with the subtraction of surface reflectance (PROREF), and the simplified PROCOSINE (sPROCOSINE).
   Our results demonstrated that the contribution of surface reflectance component was significant for BRF spectra and the effect of surface reflectance could be suppressed by PROCWT as well as PROREF and sPROCOSINE. Compared with STANDARD, PROCWT and the two traditional methods significantly improved the retrieval accuracies for pigments and leaf water content, but only PROCWT produced significant improvement for dry matter content with a decrease of 14.79 g/m(2) in the root mean squared error (RMSE) (30% of the mean) over the entire experimental dataset by enhancing dry matter absorption features. High scales of wavelet decomposition were favorable for the estimation of carotenoid and water contents and low scales for the estimation of chlorophyll and dry matter contents. The difference in optimal scale revealed the separation of overlapping absorption features attributed to various chemical constituents. In addition, the newest PROSPECT-D outperformed PROSPECT-5B in the retrieval of chlorophyll content but not for carotenoid. This new physically based approach could be beneficial to analysts attempting to retrieve leaf chemicals from BRF spectra alone and close-range reflectance imagery of crops and even other vegetation types.

AB Species distribution modeling (SDM) is an essential method in ecology and conservation. SDMs are often calibrated within one country's borders, typically along a limited environmental gradient with biased and incomplete data, making the quality of these models questionable. In this study, we evaluated how adequate are national presence-only data for calibrating regional SDMs. We trained SDMs for Egyptian bat species at two different scales: only within Egypt and at a species-specific global extent. We used two modeling algorithms: Maxent and elastic net, both under the point-process modeling framework. For each modeling algorithm, we measured the congruence of the predictions of global and regional models for Egypt, assuming that the lower the congruence, the lower the appropriateness of the Egyptian dataset to describe the species' niche. We inspected the effect of incorporating predictions from global models as additional predictor (prior) to regional models, and quantified the improvement in terms of AUC and the congruence between regional models run with and without priors. Moreover, we analyzed predictive performance improvements after correction for sampling bias at both scales. On average, predictions from global and regional models in Egypt only weakly concur. Collectively, the use of priors did not lead to much improvement: similar AUC and high congruence between regional models calibrated with and without priors. Correction for sampling bias led to higher model performance, whatever prior used, making the use of priors less pronounced. Under biased and incomplete sampling, the use of global bats data did not improve regional model performance. Without enough bias-free regional data, we cannot objectively identify the actual improvement of regional models after incorporating information from the global niche. However, we still believe in great potential for global model predictions to guide future surveys and improve regional sampling in data-poor regions.

Pine Wilt Disease (hereafter PWD) caused by the presence of the Pine wood nematode (hereafter PWN), Bursaphelenchus xylophilus is one of the most severe forest diseases in the world. The symptom development of this disease only occurs in a warmer region while the nematode itself could be widely distributed in cooler regions in its native range. Isotherm approaches have been used to estimate the distribution of this disease, but these models have not been well tested with field data. A correlative species distribution model, MaxEnt, is used to evaluate the climatic suitability for PWD at a global scale, along with a simple thermal model. The MaxEnt analysis indicated that most of the current distribution of PWD is explained by the average monthly mean temperatures of the warmest three months and aridity. The thermal model suggested larger PWD risk zones, particularly in hot and arid areas. The current distribution of some susceptible host species (e.g., Pinus syivestris) is largely outside the area suitable for the development of PWD, but results using projected future climate showed that half of those areas become at risk from PWD in future. Species distribution models such as MaxEnt are useful tools for the evaluation of not only the likely potential distributions of pests but also areas where symptom development could occur under various climatic conditions, even exotic pests not yet present in a region. Our results suggest that PWD will undoubtedly pose a major threat to European pine species if climate change proceeds as currently projected.

AB Many molecular ecology analyses assume the genotyped individuals are sampled at random from a population and thus are representative of the population. Realistically, however, a sample may contain excessive close relatives (ECR) because, for example, localized juveniles are drawn from fecund species. Our knowledge is limited about how ECR affect the routinely conducted elementary genetics analyses, and how ECR are best dealt with to yield unbiased and accurate parameter estimates. This study quantifies the effects of ECR on some popular population genetics analyses of marker data, including the estimation of allele frequencies, F-statistics, expected heterozygosity (H-e), effective and observed numbers of alleles, and the tests of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) and linkage equilibrium (LE). It also investigates several strategies for handling ECR to mitigate their impact and to yield accurate parameter estimates. My analytical work, assisted by simulations, shows that ECR have large and global effects on all of the above marker analyses. The naive approach of simply ignoring ECR could yield low-precision and often biased parameter estimates, and could cause too many false rejections of HWE and LE. The bold approach, which simply identifies and removes ECR, and the cautious approach, which estimates target parameters (e.g., H-e) by accounting for ECR and using naive allele frequency estimates, eliminate the bias and the false HWE and LE rejections, but could reduce estimation precision substantially. The likelihood approach, which accounts for ECR in estimating allele frequencies and thus target parameters relying on allele frequencies, usually yields unbiased and the most accurate parameter estimates. Which of the four approaches is the most effective and efficient may depend on the particular marker analysis to be conducted. The results are discussed in the context of using marker data for understanding population properties and marker properties.

AB In rivers, the ecological effects of drought typically result in gradual adjustments of invertebrate community structure and functioning, punctuated by sudden changes as key habitats, such as wetted channel margins, become dewatered and dry. This paper outlines the development and application of a new index (Drought Effect of Habitat Loss on Invertebrates - DEHLI) to quantify the effects of drought on instream macroinvertebrate communities by assigning weights to taxa on the basis of their likely association with key stages of channel drying. Two case studies are presented, in which the DEHLI index illustrates the ecological development of drought conditions and subsequent recovery. These examples demonstrate persistent drought effects months or several years after river flows recovered. Results derived using DEHLI are compared with an established macroinvertebrate flow velocity-reactive index (Lotic-invertebrate Index for Flow Evaluation - LIFE score) and demonstrates its greater sensitivity to drought conditions. Data from a number of rivers in south east England were used to calibrate a statistical model, which was then used to examine the response of DEHLI and LIFE to a hypothetical multi-year drought. This demonstrated a difference in response between sampling seasons, with the spring model indicating a lagged response due to delayed recolonisation and the autumn model differentiating habitat loss and flow velocity-driven responses. The application of DEHLI and the principles which underlie it allow the effects of drought on instream habitats and invertebrates associated with short or long term weather patterns to be monitored, whilst also allowing the identification of specific locations where intervention via river restoration, or revision of existing abstraction licensing, may be required to increase resilience to the effect of anthropogenic activities exacerbated by climate change.

AB A review of the scientific literature and an analysis of unpublished material identified similar to 50 possible alien molluscs from Greece, four of which were newly reported here. Records of similar to 100 additional taxa, which would strongly inflate the alien species numbers, were excluded. Among the similar to 50 candidate species, 43 were confirmed as alien and 12 as cryptogenic. Twenty-nine alien species were considered established, and four deemed invasive. Our results are consistent with the position of Greece in the east-west Mediterranean gradient, as well as the Aegean marine environment. The contribution of well-informed citizen scientists appears to be crucial to our overall knowledge of alien molluscan biotas because only 12 alien taxa were detected during formal research projects, while 31 were first found by amateurs. No molluscan introductions were confirmed from Greece pre-1960s, and subsequent periods had variable numbers of introductions, ranging from 0 (1976-1980) to 9.5 (2006-2010). The areas with the highest alien species concentrations were the Saronikos Gulf, near the Piraeus port area, and the Dodekanisa, near the Levantine coastline. Despite a general decline in taxonomic expertise and in local knowledge, we show that these are still needed when compiling and analyzing alien species inventories that subsequently influence policy and management decisions.

AB The world's freshwater biotas are declining in diversity, range and abundance, more than in other realms, with human appropriation of water. Despite considerable data on the distribution of dams and their hydrological effects on river systems, there are few expansive and long analyses of impacts on freshwater biota. We investigated trends in waterbird communities over 32years, (1983-2014), at three spatial scales in two similarly sized large river basins, with contrasting levels of water resource development, representing almost a third (29%) of Australia: the Murray-Darling Basin and the Lake Eyre Basin. The Murray-Darling Basin is Australia's most developed river basin (240 dams storing 29,893GL) while the Lake Eyre Basin is one of the less developed basins (1 dam storing 14GL). We compared the long-term responses of waterbird communities in the two river basins at river basin, catchment and major wetland scales. Waterbird abundances were strongly related to river flows and rainfall. For the developed Murray-Darling Basin, we identified significant long-term declines in total abundances, functional response groups (e.g., piscivores) and individual species of waterbird (n=50), associated with reductions in cumulative annual flow. These trends indicated ecosystem level changes. Contrastingly, we found no evidence of waterbird declines in the undeveloped Lake Eyre Basin. We also modelled the effects of the Australian Government buying up water rights and returning these to the riverine environment, at a substantial cost (>3.1AUD billion) which were projected to partly (18% improvement) restore waterbird abundances, but projected climate change effects could reduce these benefits considerably to only a 1% or 4% improvement, with respective annual recovery of environmental flows of 2,800GL or 3,200GL. Our unique large temporal and spatial scale analyses demonstrated severe long-term ecological impact of water resource development on prominent freshwater animals, with implications for global management of water resources.

AB Cities in Latin America expose high rates of urbanization and poorly controlled processes of creation of new urban peripheries. In this study we evaluated the changes in vegetation cover as a proxy of the success of urban planning in the creation or conservation of elements able to provide ecosystem services to citizens and therefore strengthening urban sustainability. Three urban agglomerations in Chile located in different climates were analysed. Four indicators were processed to understand the changes and correlations between vegetation and urban dynamics: normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), vegetation cover, normalized difference builtup index (NDBI) and built-up area. The indicators were calculated for a period over 20 years covering two parts of the city as an urban development: the urban core and the new peripheries. An overall loss of vegetation was observed in all cities has a consequence of urban expansion despite their geographical location. Moreover, the greatest losses were in new peripheries. Santiago broke this pattern of change. First its urban core showed a small increase in indicators for vegetation cover despite the increase in indicators for urban dynamics. Secondly, despite their peripheries experiencing a decrease in vegetation cover, a more detailed analysis found differences on the northern and eastern peripheries where increases of vegetation cover were observed, and other new peripheries where vegetation loss was massive. Urban planning needs to play a role not only to facilitate the creation of green spaces or other public spaces able to host vegetation, but also to form an urban structure supported by regulations that facilitate the planting and maintenance of vegetation in private spaces.

AB Over the last two decades, empirical work has established that higher biodiversity can lead to greater primary productivity; however, the importance of different aspects of biodiversity in contributing to such relationships is rarely elucidated. We assessed the relative importance of species richness, phylogenetic diversity, functional diversity, and identity of neighbors for stem growth 3 yr after seedling establishment in a tree diversity experiment in eastern Minnesota. Generally, we found that community-weighted means of key functional traits (including mycorrhizal association, leaf nitrogen and calcium, and waterlogging tolerance) as well as species richness were strong, independent predictors of stem biomass growth. More phylogenetically diverse communities did not consistently produce more biomass than expected, and the trait values or diversity of individual functional traits better predicted biomass production than did a multidimensional functional diversity metric. Furthermore, functional traits and species richness best predicted growth at the whole-plot level (12 m(2)), whereas neighborhood composition best predicted growth at the focal tree level (0.25 m(2)). The observed effects of biodiversity on growth appear strongly driven by positive complementary effects rather than by species-specific selection effects, suggesting that synergistic species' interactions rather than the influence of a few important species may drive overyielding.

TI Risk assessment of replacing conventional P fertilizers with biomass

AB Reutilizing biomass ashes in agriculture can substitute inputs of P from finite primary sources. However, recycling of ashes is disputed due to their content of toxic substances such as heavy metals. This study evaluates the potential risk of replacing easily soluble inorganic P fertilizer with P in biomass ashes in a barley crop grown on soil with adequate P status. Two contrasting doses of three different types of ashes were applied to an agricultural field with spring barley and compared to similar doses of triple-superphosphate fertilizer. In the second growing season after biomass ash application, grain, straw and root dry matter yield, and P and Cd uptake were determined. Resin-extractable P was measured in soil and the symbiotic arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal activity, colonization, and community composition were assessed. Crop yield was not affected by ash application, while P-uptake and mycorrhizal status were slightly enhanced with high ash applications. Changes to the mycorrhizal community composition were evident with high ash doses. Cadmium uptake in aboveground plant tissue was unaffected by ash treatments, but increased in roots with increasing doses. Consequently, we conclude that fertilization with biomass ashes can replace conventional fertilizers without risk to barley crops in the short term. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Assessing the extent to which changes in lacustrine biodiversity are affected by anthropogenic or climatic forces requires extensive palaeolimnological data. We used high-throughput sequencing to generate time-series data encompassing over 2200 years of microbial eukaryotes (protists and Fungi) diversity changes from the sedimentary DNA record of two lakes (Lake Bourget in French Alps and Lake Igaliku in Greenland). From 176 samples, we sequenced a large diversity of microbial eukaryotes, with a total 16 386 operational taxonomic units distributed within 50 phylogenetic groups. Thus, microbial groups, such as Chlorophyta, Dinophyceae, Haptophyceae and Ciliophora, that were not previously considered in lacustrine sediment record analyses appeared to be potential biological markers of trophic status changes. Our data suggest that shifts in relative abundance of extant species, including shifts between rare and abundant taxa, drive ecosystem responses to local and global environmental changes. Community structure shift events were concomitant with major climate variations (more particularly in Lake Igaliku). However, this study shows that the impacts of climatic fluctuations may be overpassed by the high-magnitude eutrophication impacts, as observed in the eutrophicated Lake Bourget. Overall, our data show that DNA preserved in sediment constitutes a precious archive of information on past biodiversity changes.

AB Theory and empirical estimates agree that the ratio of effective size (N-e) to census size (N) falls roughly in the range 0.1-0.5 for most populations. In a number of marine species, however, genetic estimates of contemporary N-e/N are as much as 5-6 orders of magnitude lower. Although some mechanisms that could produce such tiny N-e/N ratios have been proposed, the subject remains controversial. This issue is important to resolve: if N-e/N can be 10(-3) or smaller, marine fish populations that are quite large could be at genetic risk. Based on a recently-improved understanding of factors that influence N-e and N-e/N in species with overlapping generations, this paper evaluates conditions necessary to produce tiny N-e/N ratios in actual populations. These analyses show that although increased longevity, fecundity and variance in reproductive success that increase with age, and increased egg quality with age [the big old fat fecund female fish (BOFFFF) hypothesis] all reduce N-e/N, extreme scenarios are required to reduce N-e/N below about 0.01. Therefore, tiny N-e/N ratios require some version of Hedgecock's 'sweepstakes' hypothesis, whereby only a few families reproduce successfully. Simulations using common genetically-based estimators show that, when true N-e is very large (>= 10(6)), a substantial fraction of point estimates of N-e/N can be 10(-3) or smaller. These results mean that tiny, genetically-based point estimates of N-e/N in large marine populations are expected to be quite common, even when the true N-e/N ratio is 'normal' (similar to 0.1 or higher). Very large samples of individuals can reduce, but not eliminate, this problem. The simulation results also emphasize the importance of considering deviations from model assumptions (e.g. non-random sampling; weak selection or migration) that may be relatively small (and hence can generally be ignored when the signal is strong) but can lead to substantial biases when the drift signal is weak, as is likely for large marine populations. Empirical studies of this topic need to be able to distinguish between episodes of sweepstakes reproductive success that are ephemeral and lead to chaotic genetic patchiness, and those that are consistent enough across space and time to produce persistent evolutionary consequences.

AB Questions: Secondary succession in the tropics can follow alternative pathways. Land-use history is known to engender alternative successional communities, but the underlying mechanisms driving and sustaining divergence remain unclear. In this study we aim to answer the following questions: (1) does previous land use act as a filter for species composition in secondary forests; and (2) what are the relative roles of management practices, soil properties and landscape composition in determining species composition?
   Location: Central Amazon, Brazil.
   Methods: We sampled trees, shrubs and palms (>= 1cm diameter) in 38 early secondary forests (5 yr after abandonment) located along gradients of land-use intensity in five shifting cultivation landscapes. We measured the diameter and height of each sampled plant, identified it to species or morpho-species level and checked if it was resprouting or not. At each secondary forest we also collected soil samples for chemical and physical analyses and estimated the amount of old-growth forest surrounding it (landscape composition).
   Results: We found that previous land-use intensity determined species composition. With increasing land-use intensity, management practices of cut-and-burn and associated reduction in soil quality filtered out seed-dependent species and favoured strong sprouters and species that can cope with low nutrient availability. Landscape composition had a weak effect on species assemblages. We found specific species assemblages and indicator species associated with different levels of previous land-use intensity. As a consequence of these local filters, species alpha- and beta-diversity decreased and therefore early successional communities became more similar to each other.
   Conclusion: Species composition of successional forests is strongly determined by different land-use intensities. Dispersal limitation has a limited effect on determining the composition of the dominant species. Filtering effects of management practices and soil quality determine the species dominating the canopy at early stages of succession and narrow down the range of species able to colonize and establish. This study highlights how land use shapes successional communities and suggests that alternative successional pathways are determined at early stages of succession. Therefore, accounting for land-use history is crucial to improve the understanding of tropical secondary succession. We present a list of indicator species for different levels of previous land-use intensity that can be used to support conservation and restoration decisions in the Amazon.

The scarcity of flow data makes impossible to characterize the hydrological regime of temporary streams and, in consequence, to select the correct periods and methods to determine their ecological status. This is why the TREHS software is being developed, in the framework of the LIFE Trivers project. It will help managers to implement adequately the European Water Framework Directive in this kind of water body. TREHS, using the methodology described in Gallart et al. (2012), defines six transient 'aquatic states', based on hydrological conditions representing different mesohabitats, for a given reach at a particular moment. Because of its qualitative nature, this approach allows using alternative methodologies to assess the regime of temporary rivers when there are no observed flow data. These methods, based on interviews and high-resolution aerial photographs, were tested for estimating the aquatic regime of temporary rivers. All the gauging stations (13) belonging to the Catalan Internal Catchments (NE Spain) with recurrent zero-flow periods were selected to validate this methodology. On the one hand, non-structured interviews were conducted with inhabitants of villages near the gauging stations. On the other hand, the historical series of available orthophotographs were examined. Flow records measured at the gauging stations were used to validate the alternative methods. Flow permanence in the reaches was estimated reasonably by the interviews and adequately by aerial photographs, when compared with the values estimated using daily flows. The degree of seasonality was assessed only roughly by the interviews. The recurrence of disconnected pools was not detected by flow records but was estimated with some divergences by the two methods. The combination of the two alternative methods allows substituting or complementing flow records, to be updated in the future through monitoring by professionals and citizens. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB The aquarium hobby is popular worldwide, but it has positives and negatives for freshwater fish conservation. The most damaging impacts of the aquarium trade on ecosystems are overharvesting and invasive species. Consequently, many conservationists and academics have the perception that aquarium hobbyists are generally harmful to species conservation. Without overlooking these major drawbacks of the aquarium hobby, we aim to establish common ground between hobbyists and conservationists by correcting some misconceptions and showing the benefits of serious aquarium hobbyists in the conservation of freshwater fishes and their habitats. Our overview illustrates that the aquarium hobby is not insensitive to the pernicious effects of this enduring hobby on natural systems and that serious aquarists and their associations can directly assist and fund scientific research, increase conservation awareness among the general public and even participate in ex situ and in situ conservation programmes for native fish species at national or international levels. Whilst the relationship between conservationists and the aquarium hobby has often been antagonistic in recent years, ultimately most biologists and aquarists share a love of the species they study or maintain, and this common interest could be the basis for a more positive and productive relationship.

AB Although intermittent rivers (IRs) are coupled aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, their constituent communities are generally considered separately by ecologists. Yet, both communities are disturbed by alternating flowing and dry phases. IRs are thus good systems in which to explore the parallels and contrasts in community organisation in response to disturbance, and gain understanding in the drivers of these responses. We compared the structure and composition of aquatic and terrestrial communities in the Albarine River, France. We collected aquatic and/or terrestrial invertebrates in the riverbed and adjacent riparian zone at four intermittent reaches and aquatic invertebrates in the riverbed at three perennial reaches over 1year. A total of 175 taxa were collected at intermittent reaches, including 62 aquatic and 113 terrestrial taxa, contrasting with the low biodiversity generally associated with IRs. Aquatic and terrestrial communities were mainly subsets of those in perennial reaches and in the riparian zone, respectively, indicating that the riverbed of intermittent reaches is strongly linked to perennial reaches and the riparian zone by dispersal. Total taxonomic richness in the riverbed (i.e. diversity) of intermittent reaches was mainly due to among-reach variation for terrestrial invertebrates, but to within-reach variation for aquatic invertebrates. For both communities, among-reach dissimilarity was mainly due to spatial turnover rather than community nestedness. Spatial turnover was higher for terrestrial communities than for aquatic communities. Our results indicate that aquatic and terrestrial communities have different organisation patterns in this intermittent river; probably in response to the contrasting spatial arrangements of colonist sources. Heterogeneous sources of terrestrial colonists along the riparian zone compared to more homogeneous sources of aquatic colonists from perennial reaches could explain the relative contribution of nestedness versus turnover.

AB Snakes are a diverse and important group of vertebrates. However, relationships among the major groups of snakes have remained highly uncertain, with recent studies hypothesizing very different (and typically weakly supported) relationships. Here, we address family-level snake relationships with new phylogenomic data from 3776 nuclear loci from ultraconserved elements (1.40 million aligned base pairs, 52% missing data overall) sampled from 29 snake species that together represent almost all families, a dataset similar to 100 times larger than used in previous studies. We found relatively strong support from species-tree analyses (NJst) for most relationships, including three largely novel clades: (1) a Glade uniting the boas, pythons and their relatives, (2) a Glade placing cylindrophiids and uropeltids with this Glade, and (3) a Glade uniting bolyeriids (Round Island boas) with pythonids and their relatives (xenopeltids and loxocemids). Relationships among families of advanced snakes (caenophidians) were also strongly supported. The results show the potential for phylogenomic analyses to resolve difficult groups, but also show a surprising sensitivity of the analyses to the inclusion or exclusion of outgroups.

AB In this paper we explore new options for model selection in the distribution modelling method MaxEnt, offered by the strict maximum likelihood explanation of the method. These options, which are collectively referred to as the 'alternative MaxEnt procedure' (aMp), imply manual forward stepwise selection of variables and an F-ratio test to compare nested models. We compared aMp models with models obtained by the default variable transformation and model selection procedures in the popular Maxent.jar software ('default MaxEnt procedure; dMp), which invokes l(1)-regularisation. We used swamp-forest presence in SE Norway as the target for our modelling. Eleven terrain variables derived from a LiDAR-based digital elevation map, making up three groups of internally correlated variables, were used as predictors in the models. An independently collected presence/absence 'test' data set was used for evaluation of models. Although dMp models were much more complex than aMp models, with up to 240 variables derived from the original 11, compared to a maximum number of derived variables in aMp models of 14, no significant difference in performance between dMp and aMp models was found. This indicates that the regularisation procedure is not the main reason for the good performance of MaxEnt (as implemented in Maxent.jar) in comparative studies. Advantages of the more flexible aMp procedure, which produces simpler models, are discussed. Effects of spatial autocorrelation in the response variable on modelling results were addressed by obtaining parallel MaxEnt models for two response variables that differ in the number of presence observations: the centroid of the 121 swamp forests and the 7175 grid cells, each 5 m x 5 m, in which swamp forest was recorded as present. Our results are not conclusive with respect to the effect of spatial autocorrelation in the response variable on the predictive performance of distribution models by MaxEnt. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB Environmental changes are expected to shift the distribution of functional trait values in plant communities through a combination of species turnover and intraspecific variation. The strength of these shifts may depend on the availability of individuals with trait values adapted to new environmental conditions, represented by the functional diversity (FD) of existing community residents or dispersal from the regional species pool. We conducted a 3-year nutrient- and seed-addition experiment in old-field plant communities to examine the contributions of species turnover and intraspecific variation to community trait shifts, focusing on four key plant functional traits: vegetative height, leaf area, specific leaf area (SLA), and leaf dry matter content (LDMC). We further examined the influence of initial FD and seed availability on the strength of these shifts. Community mean height, leaf area, and SLA increased in response to fertilization, and these shifts were driven almost entirely by intraspecific variation. The strength of intraspecific shifts in height and leaf area was positively related to initial intraspecific FD in these traits. Intraspecific trait responses to fertilization varied among species, with species of short stature displaying stronger shifts in SLA and LDMC but weaker shifts in leaf area. Trait shifts due to species turnover were generally weak and opposed intraspecific responses. Seed addition altered community taxonomic composition but had little effect on community trait shifts. These results highlight the importance of intraspecific variation for short-term community functional responses and demonstrate that the strength of these responses may be mediated by community FD.

AB Minimizing the ecological impact of land development is a fundamental principle of sustainable development. Ecological suitability assessment is the key to realizing sustainability and is also significant for optimizing spatial patterns of territorial development. Especially in mountainous areas where the ecosystem is both vulnerable and important, quantitative evaluation of ecological suitability for land development is particularly important and urgent given current development strategy of urban construction in mountainous areas in China. Taking Dali Bai Autonomous Prefecture, a representative urban construction zone in a mountainous area in Yunnan Province, China, as a study area, and based on the fundamental theory of structural and functional dynamics from landscape ecology, this study has explored the integrated ecological resistance (IER) conceptual model and constructed an index system with aspects of ecological elements, ecological importance, and ecological resilience. The results showed that: (1) the ecological suitability level was higher in the north than in the south and higher in the east than in the west, as well as higher in the Bazi region than in mountainous areas. Dali City, Binchuan County, and Xiangyun County had large ecological suitable zones for development and construction. Foci of ecological resistance having strong ecological constraints were mainly concentrated in Heqing County and in various other places; (2) by combining the integrated ecological resistance and arable land distributions, the study area was zoned into five regions: prior development zone, moderate development zone, potential development zone, restricted development zone, and forbidden development zone. Moderate, potential, and restricted development zones occupied most of the area, accounting for 28.89%, 24.69%, and 21.40%, respectively, whereas prior development zones accounted for only 8.91%; (3) based on the areal proportions of ecological suitability zoning, the 12 counties of Dali Prefecture can be grouped into three categories: prior areas for conservation, comprehensive development areas, and prior areas for development. Xiangyun County and Binchuan County should be regarded as key areas of Dali Prefecture for urban construction in mountainous areas. This research has explored an ecological suitability evaluation system from the perspective of landscape ecology and made fully understanding of ecological suitability factors in the study area, which provided a good reference to ecological suitability evaluation for mountainous area development in the worldwide.

AB AimClimate change and other anthropogenic global change drivers act in complex, mutually exacerbating ways to alter the abundance and distribution of species. In South Africa, pied crows Corvus albus have increased in numbers and range in recent decades. Popular opinion links these changes to urbanisation and infrastructure development, but there has been no empirical test of this idea. We aimed to clarify the drivers of pied crow population changes in South Africa.
   LocationSouth Africa.
   MethodsWe used publicly available long-term datasets, the Southern African Bird Atlas Project and University of Delaware Gridded Climate Database, and spatial data from government bodies, to assess relationships between pied crow population and range changes, land use, infrastructure, urbanisation and climate change.
   ResultsPied crow numbers have increased significantly in the past three decades, but rate of increase varied geographically, with crows declining in the northeast and increasing in the south-west of South Africa. Pied crow population changes were strongly correlated with climate change. Crows have benefited most from climate warming in the shrubland biomes of south-western South Africa. Pied crows are tree nesters, and within these shrublands, there is a strong positive relationship between the rate of population increase and the density of powerline infrastructure, which may facilitate pied crows' increase by providing nesting sites.
   Main conclusionsPied crow numbers have increased in response to climate warming, with their spread facilitated by electrical infrastructure in south-western South Africa, providing a clear example of compound influence of multiple global change drivers promoting a significant change in species range and reporting rate. Pied crows are generalist predators and there is popular concern about their ecological impact in areas where increases have occurred. We highlight the importance of understanding the ecosystem-level implications of increased numbers of pied crows in South Africa's shrubland biomes.

AB A good knowledge of the spatiotemporal patterns of the causes of wildfire ignition is crucial to an effective fire policy. However, little is known about the situation in south-eastern France because the fire database contains unreliable data. We used data for cases with well-established causes from 1973-2013 to determine the location of spatial hotspots, the seasonal distribution, the underlying anthropogenic and environmental drivers and the tendency of five main causes to generate large fires. Anthropogenic ignitions were predominant (88%) near human settlements and infrastructures in the lowlands, whilst lightning-induced fires were more common in the coastal mountains. In densely populated urban areas, small summer fires were predominating, due to the negligence of private individuals around their homes or accidental ignitions near infrastructures. In rural hinterlands, ignitions due to negligence by professionals generate many medium-sized fires from autumn to spring. Intentional and accidental ignitions contribute the most to the total burned area and to large fires. We conclude that socioeconomic factors partially control the fire regime, influencing the timing, spatial distribution and potential size of fires. This improved understanding of why, where and when ignitions occur provides the opportunity for controlling certain causes of ignitions and adapting French policy to global changes.

AB Climate changes impose requirements for many species to shift their ranges to remain within environmentally tolerable areas, but near-continuous regions of intense human land use stretching across continental extents diminish dispersal prospects for many species. We reviewed the impact of habitat loss and fragmentation on species' abilities to track changing climates and existing plans to facilitate species dispersal in response to climate change through regions of intensive land uses, drawing on examples from North America and elsewhere. We identified an emerging analytical framework that accounts for variation in species' dispersal capacities relative to both the pace of climate change and habitat availability. Habitat loss and fragmentation hinder climate change tracking, particularly for specialists, by impeding both propagule dispersal and population growth. This framework can be used to identify prospective modern-era climatic refugia, where the pace of climate change has been slower than surrounding areas, that are defined relative to individual species' needs. The framework also underscores the importance of identifying and managing dispersal pathways or corridors through semi-continental land use barriers that can benefit many species simultaneously. These emerging strategies to facilitate range shifts must account for uncertainties around population adaptation to local environmental conditions. Accounting for uncertainties in climate change and dispersal capabilities among species and expanding biological monitoring programs within an adaptive management paradigm are vital strategies that will improve species' capacities to track rapidly shifting climatic conditions across landscapes dominated by intensive human land use.

AB Adaptations to resource availability strongly shape patterns of community composition along successional gradients in environmental conditions. In the present study, we examined the extent to which variation in functional composition explains shifts in trait-based functional strategies in young tropical secondary forests during the most dynamic stage of succession (0-20 years). Functional composition of two size classes in 51 secondary forest plots was determined using community-weighted means of seven functional traits, which were intensively measured on 55 woody plant species (n = 875-1,761 individuals). Along the successional gradient in forest structure, there was a significant and consistent shift in functional strategies from resource acquisition to resource conservation. Leaf toughness and adult plant size increased significantly, while net photosynthetic capacity (A (mass)) decreased significantly during succession. Shifts in functional strategies within size classes for A (mass) and wood density also support the hypothesis that changes in functional composition are shaped by environmental conditions along successional gradients. In general, 'hard' functional traits, e.g., A (mass) and leaf toughness, linked to different facets of plant performance exhibited greater sensitivity to successional changes in forest structure than 'soft' traits, such as leaf mass area and leaf dry matter content. Our results also suggested that stochastic processes related to previous land-use history, dispersal limitation, and abiotic factors explained variation in functional composition beyond that attributed to deterministic shifts in functional strategies. Further data on seed dispersal vectors and distance and landscape configuration are needed to improve current mechanistic models of succession in tropical secondary forests.

AB Mistletoes use far more water per unit carbon fixed during photosynthesis than their hosts (i.e. they have lower water use efficiency', WUE). The widely cited nitrogen-parasitism hypothesis' posits that N is the most limiting resource for mistletoes and that they use their faster transpiration rates to acquire sufficient N from the host xylem.In a rather different context, the mimicry hypothesis' arose in the literature suggesting that some mistletoes mimic the morphology of host leaves in order to deploy higher N leaves without suffering higher levels of herbivory. These two non-exclusive hypotheses share the common goal of trying to explain patterns of mistletoe leaf N concentration. We set out to test the generality of both hypotheses at broad geographic scale using data for 168 mistletoes-host pairs, from 39 sites, encompassing all continents except Antarctica. We drew together data from published literature and our own field data on two key plant functional traits, leaf N concentration (N-mass) and leaf carbon isotopic composition (C-13) (representing long-term WUE and degree of stomatal control over photosynthesis). Key findings included (i) little or no support for the N-parasitism hypothesis: differences in mistletoe and host N-mass explained only 3% variation in differences in leaf C-13, and mistletoe-host differences in leaf C-13 were unrelated to whether or not the hosts were N-fixers (presumed to have higher N concentration in xylem sap); (ii) partial support for the mimicry hypothesis: mimic mistletoes generally had higher N-mass when associated with N-fixing hosts (but, on non-N-fixing hosts there was no such pattern); and (iii) more broadly, mistletoes showed similar trait responses as their hosts to environmental drivers; for example, they showed similar-magnitude shifts in N-mass and C-13 in relation to site aridity. Contrary to current belief, our findings suggest that nitrogen is not the limiting nutrient for mistletoes, at least not the main component driving the faster transpiration rates. Our results also give insight into the evolution of mimicry in mistletoes and show, for the first time, that mistletoes are also constrained by local water availability, exhibiting clear trait adaptations to environmental gradients. By reconsidering these issues at broad geographic scale and across a large number of species, our findings substantially modify current knowledge on the ecology and physiology of mistletoes and their hosts.

AB Tropical forests in Borneo maintain a high level of productivity/biomass even under phosphorus (P)-limited conditions. The P-acquisition properties of roots may be an important factor that contributes to forest productivity, but they have not been well evaluated compared with above-ground properties of plants.
   In this study, we analysed root acid phosphatase activity and morphological properties (surface area, diameter and tissue density of roots) of dominant tree species in three tropical montane forests on Mt. Kinabalu, Borneo, to investigate changes in root properties along a soil P availability gradient.
   We found at the community level that root phosphatase activity and specific root surface area (root surface area per gram root biomass) increased, and root diameter decreased, with decreasing soil P availability at the community level, and the relationship was not changed in general even if we focused on a single-tree species distributed across multiple study sites that differ in soil P availability. Root acid phosphatase was significantly positively correlated with specific root surface area, and negatively correlated with root diameter, suggesting that finer roots have higher phosphatase activities.
   Furthermore, we compared root acid phosphatase activity with leaf P concentration of a given tree species and found a significant negative correlation between them. The significant correlation suggested that root P-acquisition properties could influence leaf P concentration, and/or viceversa. Below-ground properties (i.e. root P-acquisition properties) might be directly/indirectly linked to above-ground properties (i.e. leaf P concentration) of a tree individual.
   In conclusion, the root physiological and morphological properties change along a gradient of soil P availability in the tropical montane forests. In addition, the changes in the root properties are coordinated with the changes in leaf P concentrations. The adaptive changes in the above-ground and below-ground properties along the soil P gradient could contribute to the maintenance of forest productivity in the tropical montane forest in Borneo.

AB Global environmental change entails not only climatic alterations, but also changes in land use. Freshwater ecosystems are particularly sensitive to both of these changes, and their sustainable management requires better information on likely responses. To examine the effects of climate and land use on the freshwater community, the distributions of stream macroinvertebrates of the Changjiang catchment in south-east China were modelled. The present distributions of 72 taxa were predicted using environmental variables generated by regional climate, land-use and hydrological models. Hydrological predictors, sensitive to both climate and land use, were the most relevant predictors in the species distribution models (SDMs), followed by land use. The stream macroinvertebrates' distributions were then projected for the period 2021 to 2050 using three different future scenarios: (i) climate change, (ii) land-use change and (iii) climate and land-use change combined. Land-use change was predicted to have the strongest negative impact on the community, with reductions in local richness (-20%), predicted diversity (-0.3%) and range size (-25%) and a general shift towards higher altitudes (+12%). The climate-change scenario had a negative effect on predicted diversity (-0.1%) and resulted in a moderate altitudinal shift (+3%) along with increased richness (+15%) and range size (+19%). In the combined scenario, climate and land-use changes counterbalanced each other to a certain degree, but had an overall detrimental effect. The results underscore the high relevance of land-use change in future distribution predictions, exemplify the possible effect of interactions between land use and climate on hydrology and indicate how such responses can vary among freshwater taxa. The model also allows the detection of key environmental variables, the identification of vulnerable species and the definition of their potential distributions. This information is essential to establishing effective management and conservation strategies and gives a more comprehensive insight into the possible effects of global environmental change on freshwater ecosystems.

AB Although whole-genome sequencing is becoming more accessible and feasible for nonmodel organisms, microsatellites have remained the markers of choice for various population and conservation genetic studies. However, the criteria for choosing microsatellites are still controversial due to ascertainment bias that may be introduced into the genetic inference. An empirical study of red deer (Cervus elaphus) populations, in which cross-specific and species-specific microsatellites developed through pyrosequencing of enriched libraries, was performed for this study. Two different strategies were used to select the species-specific panels: randomly vs. highly polymorphic markers. The results suggest that reliable and accurate estimations of genetic diversity can be obtained using random microsatellites distributed throughout the genome. In addition, the results reinforce previous evidence that selecting the most polymorphic markers leads to an ascertainment bias in estimates of genetic diversity, when compared with randomly selected microsatellites. Analyses of population differentiation and clustering seem less influenced by the approach of microsatellite selection, whereas assigning individuals to populations might be affected by a random selection of a small number of microsatellites. Individual multilocus heterozygosity measures produced various discordant results, which in turn had impacts on the heterozygosity-fitness correlation test. Finally, we argue that picking the appropriate microsatellite set should primarily take into account the ecological and evolutionary questions studied. Selecting the most polymorphic markers will generally overestimate genetic diversity parameters, leading to misinterpretations of the real genetic diversity, which is particularly important in managed and threatened populations.

AB Corridors are frequently proposed to connect patches of habitat that have become isolated due to human-mediated alterations to the landscape. While it is understood that corridors can facilitate dispersal between patches, it remains unknown whether corridors can mitigate the negative genetic effects for entire communities modified by habitat fragmentation. These negative genetic effects, which include reduced genetic diversity, limit the potential for populations to respond to selective agents such as disease epidemics and global climate change. We provide clear evidence from a forward-time, agent-based model (ABM) that corridors can facilitate genetic resilience in fragmented habitats across a broad range of species dispersal abilities and population sizes. Our results demonstrate that even modest increases in corridor width decreased the genetic differentiation between patches and increased the genetic diversity and effective population size within patches. Furthermore, we document a trade-off between corridor quality and corridor design whereby populations connected by high-quality habitat (i.e., low corridor mortality) are more resilient to suboptimal corridor design (e.g., long and narrow corridors). The ABM also revealed that species interactions can play a greater role than corridor design in shaping the genetic responses of populations to corridors. These results demonstrate how corridors can provide long-term conservation benefits that extend beyond targeted taxa and scale up to entire communities irrespective of species dispersal abilities or population sizes.

AB Patch-mosaic burning is a widely accepted practical approach to managing biodiversity, whereby spatial and temporal diversity of fire is manipulated to benefit biotic diversity. We use simulation experiments based on stochastic population viability analysis to evaluate the implications of contrasting patch-mosaic burning scenarios for the population dynamics and risk of decline of four species of small mammals in northern Australia. Our results, based on models developed from detailed mark-recapture data, suggest that fire frequency has more influence on small-mammal persistence than fire extent. Risk of extinction increased for all four species when fire frequency exceeded once every five years. Under current ambient fire regimes most Australia tropical savannas burn more frequently and therefore seem to have unfavourable consequences for this faunal group and risk precipitating severe future declines.

AB Balancing the freshwater needs of humans and ecosystems is a fundamental challenge for the management of rivers worldwide. River regulation and water extraction can affect all components of the natural flow regime, yet few studies have investigated the effects on the low-flow end of the hydrograph. Low-flow periods are hydrologically distinctive and ecologically important, varying in nature among climatic zones. Tropical savannah rivers are characterized by highly seasonal and predictable flow regimes, but with high interannual variation in the magnitude, timing, and duration of low flows. Many tropical savannah rivers are relatively intact, especially in northern Australia, but many are now receiving increasing attention for water-resource development through surface- and groundwater extraction. We identified the hydroecological effects of water extraction on 3 phases of the seasonal flow regime: the wet-dry transition, dry season, and dry-wet season transition for perennial and intermittent rivers in tropical savannah climates. We propose a conceptual model and 7 predictions that describe the ecological implications of dry-season water extraction in tropical savannah river systems worldwide. The predictions address: 1) connectivity, 2) availability of in-stream habitat, 3) dry-season persistence of in-channel refugia, 4) water quality during dry-wet and wet-dry transition periods, 5) decoupling of wet- and dry-season flows, and the cumulative effects on 6) groundwater-dependent species and 7) whole-ecosystem shifts. We used northern Australia as a case study to review the current level of evidence in support of these predictions and their potential ecological consequences, and used this review to propose key priorities for future research that are globally applicable.

AB The loss of biodiversity is threatening ecosystem productivity and services worldwide, spurring efforts to quantify its effects on the functioning of natural ecosystems. Previous research has focused on the positive role of biodiversity on resource acquisition (i.e., niche complementarity), but a lack of study on resource utilization efficiency, a link between resource and productivity, has rendered it difficult to quantify the biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationship. Here we demonstrate that biodiversity loss reduces plant productivity, other things held constant, through theory, empirical evidence, and simulations under gradually relaxed assumptions. We developed a theoretical model named niche-efficiency to integrate niche complementarity and a heretofore-ignored mechanism of diminishing marginal productivity in quantifying the effects of biodiversity loss on plant productivity. Based on niche-efficiency, we created a relative productivity metric and a productivity impact index (PII) to assist in biological conservation and resource management. Relative productivity provides a standardized measure of the influence of biodiversity on individual productivity, and PII is a functionally based taxonomic index to assess individual species' inherent value in maintaining current ecosystem productivity. Empirical evidence from the Alaska boreal forest suggests that every 1% reduction in overall plant diversity could render an average of 0.23% decline in individual tree productivity. Out of the 283 plant species of the region, we found that large woody plants generally have greater PII values than other species. This theoretical model would facilitate the integration of biological conservation in the international campaign against several pressing global issues involving energy use, climate change, and poverty.

AB A fundamental problem in wildlife ecology and management is estimation of population size or density. The two dominant methods in this area are capture-recapture (CR) and distance sampling (DS), each with its own largely separate literature. We develop a class of models that synthesizes them. It accommodates a spectrum of models ranging from nonspatial CR models (with no information on animal locations) through to DS and mark-recapture distance sampling (MRDS) models, in which animal locations are observed without error. Between these lie spatially explicit capture-recapture (SECR) models that include only capture locations, and a variety of models with less location data than are typical of DS surveys but more than are normally used on SECR surveys. In addition to unifying CR and DS models, the class provides a means of improving inference from SECR models by adding supplementary location data, and a means of incorporating measurement error into DS and MRDS models. We illustrate their utility by comparing inference on acoustic surveys of gibbons and frogs using only capture locations, using estimated angles (gibbons) and combinations of received signal strength and time-of-arrival data (frogs), and on a visual MRDS survey of whales, comparing estimates with exact and estimated distances. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.

AB Island populations may evolve distinct behavioral repertoires as a response to the conditions of insular life. Strong intraspecific competition is typical in insular lizards and may include cannibalism. In this study, we investigated sexual and age patterns of aggression in two populations of the Skyros wall lizard (Podarcis gaigeae), one from the main island of Skyros (Aegean Sea, Greece) and another from the satellite islet Diavates. The latter is terrestrial predator-free biotope, hosting a dense population of large-bodied lizards that have been reported to exert cannibalism. In staged encounters, we examined the aggressive propensities of adult male and female lizards against their age-peers and juveniles. Males from both populations were much more aggressive than females toward juveniles and other adults. Males from Diavates were more frequently aggressive to juveniles and other male lizards than males from Skyros. Diavates cannibals also captured their targets at shorter latency. We ascribe this distinct behavioral pattern to the high population density. Infanticide and intramale aggressiveness confer two great advantages to cannibals: food and elimination of future rivals.

AB Global change analyses usually consider biodiversity as a global asset that needs to be preserved. Biodiversity is frequently analysed mainly as a response variable affected by diverse environmental drivers. However, recent studies highlight that gradients of biodiversity are associated with gradual changes in the distribution of key dominant functional groups characterized by distinctive traits and stoichiometry, which in turn often define the rates of ecosystem processes and nutrient cycling. Moreover, pervasive links have been reported between biodiversity, food web structure, ecosystem function and species stoichiometry. Here we review current global stoichiometric gradients and how future distributional shifts in key functional groups may in turn influence basic ecosystem functions (production, nutrient cycling, decomposition) and therefore could exert a feedback effect on stoichiometric gradients. The C-N-P stoichiometry of most primary producers (phytoplankton, algae, plants) has been linked to functional trait continua (i.e. to major axes of phenotypic variation observed in inter-specific analyses of multiple traits). In contrast, the C-N-P stoichiometry of higher-level consumers remains less precisely quantified in many taxonomic groups. We show that significant links are observed between trait continua across trophic levels. In spite of recent advances, the future reciprocal feedbacks between key functional groups, biodiversity and ecosystem functions remain largely uncertain. The reported evidence, however, highlights the key role of stoichiometric traits and suggests the need of a progressive shift towards an ecosystemic and stoichiometric perspective in global biodiversity analyses.

AB The European pond turtle (Emys orbicularis) is a Nearctic element in the African fauna and thought to have invaded North Africa from the Iberian Peninsula. All North African populations are currently identified with the subspecies E. o. occidentalis. However, a nearly range-wide sampling in North Africa used for analyses of mitochondrial and microsatellite DNA provides evidence that only Moroccan populations belong to this taxon, while eastern Algerian and Tunisian pond turtles represent an undescribed distinct subspecies. These two taxa are most closely related to E. o. galloitalica with a native distribution along the Mediterranean coast of northern Spain through southern France to western and southern Italy. This group is sister to a clade comprising several mitochondrial lineages and subspecies of E. orbicularis from Central and Eastern Europe plus Asia, and the successive sisters are E. o. hellenica and E. trinacris. Our results suggest that E. orbicularis has been present in North Africa longer than on the Iberian Peninsula and that after an initial invasion of North Africa by pond turtles from an unknown European source region, there was a phase of diversification in North Africa, followed by a later re-invasion of Europe by one of the African lineages. The differentiation of pond turtles in North Africa parallels a general phylogeographic paradigm in amphibians and reptiles, with deeply divergent lineages in the western and eastern Maghreb. Acknowledging their genetic similarity, we propose to synonymize the previously recognized Iberian subspecies E. o. fritzjuergenobsti with E. o. occidentalis sensu stricto. The seriously imperiled Moroccan populations of E. o. occidentalis represent two Management Units different in mitochondrial haplotypes and microsatellite markers. The conservation status of eastern Algerian pond turtles is unclear, while Tunisian populations are endangered. Considering that Algerian and Tunisian pond turtles represent an endemic taxon, their situation throughout the historical range should be surveyed to establish a basis for conservation measures.

AB Drought is an important natural disturbance that influences community structure by altering species composition, abundance, and richness. Human-induced alterations of the hydrologic cycle and climate change can exacerbate the impact of drought, potentially leading to species extirpations and changes in community structure. These changes in community structure can lead to substantial alterations and losses of ecosystem functions. Nutrient recycling is an important ecosystem function that helps modify rates of production and food web structure. Animals are important in cycling and storing nutrients in aquatic ecosystems through feeding, growth, and excretion. Freshwater mussels are long-lived animals, often living more than 20 years, and perform important ecosystem functions such as nutrient storage and cycling. Mussels dominate benthic biomass in many aquatic systems, and thus can be an essential component affecting nutrient dynamics, Unfortunately, they are experiencing rapid declines. In this study, we surveyed freshwater mussel populations across nine sites in three rivers in the south-central U.S. immediately before and after an exceptional, regional drought. We characterized the hydrological severity of the drought and estimated mussel biomass loss and the consequent loss of mussel-provided nutrient cycling and storage. We determined if losses differed between mussel thermal guilds and how such losses might influence nutrient dynamics and stoichiometry. Additionally, we investigated whether losses caused by the drought were intensified by different land cover types. Our surveys indicated that there were declines in both density and biomass of mussels, and greater losses were associated with areas that had less forest cover. This die-off resulted in a lower availability of N and reduced P storage by freshwater mussels in these rivers, potentially altering system nutrient availability. Additionally, our analyses showed that thermally sensitive species have lower tissue N:P. Thus, our results show that differences in species tolerance to drought may lead to varying storage and release of nutrients. Further studies incorporating net flux and storage will allow scientists to better understand the repercussions of species loss to ecosystem function. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB 1. Molecular genetic techniques have been used in freshwater biology for more than 30 years. Early work focussed on studies of population structure, systematics and taxonomy. More recently, the range of studies has broadened to include ecology and adaptation. Advances in analytical methods and in technology (e.g. next-generation sequencing) and decreasing costs of data production ensure that the field will continue to develop and broaden in scope.
   2. At least three factors make the application of molecular techniques to freshwater biology exciting. First, the highly variable nature of many aquatic habitats makes them excellent models for the study of environmental change on ecological and evolutionary time scales. Second, the mature state of the field of freshwater biology provides an extensive foundation of ecological knowledge of freshwater organisms and their distinct adaptations. Third, the methodological advances allow researchers to focus more on merging molecular and ecological research and less on designing studies around technical limitations.
   3. We identified eight research areas in freshwater biology in which the integration of molecular and ecological approaches provides exceptional opportunities. The list is not exhaustive, but considers a broad range of topics and spans the continuum from basic to applied research. The areas identified use a combination of natural, experimental and in silico approaches.
   4. With advancing molecular techniques, freshwater biology is in an unusually strong position to link the genetic basis and ecological importance of adaptations across a wide range of taxa, ecosystems and spatiotemporal scales. Our aim was to identify opportunities for the integration of molecular and ecological approaches, to motivate greater collaboration and crossover, and to promote exploitation of the synergies of bridging ecological and evolutionary freshwater research.

AB Visual field assessments have already been tested for 'temperate' soils, but there is scant information about their applicability to 'tropical' soils. This survey contributes to the validation of the visual field assessments by comparing the performance of three of such methods on 'tropical' soils. This study was conducted across six different soils with contrasting soil type and land use, in the central-northern part of Venezuela between November 2011 and January 2012. Scores provided by the soil quality scoring procedure (SQSP), the visual evaluation of soil structure (VESS), and the visual soil assessment (VSA), as well as soil physical properties were measured to assess the soil's structural quality. All methods showed that soil structural quality was unfavourable on a loamy soil (Alfisol) with continuous cereal growth, conventional tillage and low soil organic carbon (SOC), as well as on a silty clay soil (Alfisol) under natural vegetation and cattle production. Where SQSP scores ranged between 1 (extremely firm) and 2 (firm), VESS scores ranged from 4 (compact) to 5 (very compact), and VSA scores were between 0 (poor) and 0.5 (moderately poor). The sandy clay loam (Ultisol) and clay loam (Mollisol) soils under no-tillage and with high SOC had the best soil quality. In our 'tropical' Venezuelan soils there was also high correlation (P < 0.01) between the visual assessment scores and soil physical properties such as bulk density (BD), porosity, SOC, and saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat), as has been reported for 'temperate' soils. A visual poor condition of soil structure corresponded to BD values higher than 1.4 Mg m(-3), porosity lower than 0.5 m(3) M-3, SOC below 25 g kg, and Ksat (log) values under 0.5 cm h(-1). In those cases where the rooting system could not be evaluated because of fallow, VSA and VESS appeared to be the most appropriate methods for assessing the soil structure. The rating of the indicator number of earthworms' should be adjusted for 'tropical' soils; this shall improve the accuracy of the VSA method. These methods were capable of distinguishing the different soil structural quality, and are therefore suitable for assessing soil structural quality of 'tropical' soils with contrasting soil type and land use.

AB This paper reviews successful and, briefly, unsuccessful viral biocontrol programs for invasive vertebrate pests to provide lessons for future programs, especially the potential use of cyprinid herpesvirus-3 to control carp in Australia. There have only been three major programs where viral pathogens have been used successfully against invasive vertebrate pests. Myxoma and rabbit hemorrhagic disease viruses were used to control rabbits in Australia, and feline panleukopenia virus helped eliminate cats from sub-Antarctic Marion Island. These programs have shown us that successful viral biocontrol programs for invasive species must include: a thorough understanding of the biology of the target species, and of the viral epidemiology; an integrated pest management program involving both the virus and other control methods; and, a post-release assessment of the ecological benefits of the program. The most important practical lessons identified in this review are: the greatest impact of viruses as biocontrol agents is in the first years following release; unsuspected cross-reactive viruses may confer protection on the target species; and, there may be age-or temperature-related resistance to the virus in the target species.

AB Climate change will have profound impacts on the distribution, abundance and ecology of all species. We used a multi-species transplant experiment to investigate the potential effects of a warmer climate on insect community composition and structure. Eight native Australian plant species were transplanted into sites approximately 2.5 degrees C (mean annual temperature) warmer than their native range. Subsequent insect colonisation was monitored for 12 months. We compared the insect communities on transplanted host plants at the warmer sites with control plants transplanted within the species' native range. Comparisons of the insect communities were also made among transplanted plants at warmer sites and congeneric plant species native to the warmer transplant area. We found that the morphospecies composition of the colonising Coleoptera and Hemiptera communities differed markedly between transplants at the control compared to the warmer sites. Community structure, as described by the distribution of feeding guilds, was also found to be different between the controls and transplants when the entire Coleoptera and Hemiptera community, including non-herbivore feeding guilds, was considered. However, the structure of the herbivorous insect community showed a higher level of consistency between plants at control and warm sites. There were marked differences in community composition and feeding guild structure, for both herbivores and non-herbivores, between transplants and congenerics at the warm sites. These results suggest that as the climate warms, considerable turnover in the composition of insect communities may occur, but insect herbivore communities may retain elements of their present-day structure.

AB Fire is a natural disturbance that exerts an important influence on global ecosystems, affecting vegetation distribution and structure, the carbon cycle and climate. However, human-induced changes to fire regimes may affect at-risk species groups such as small mammals. We examine the effect of fire on small mammals and evaluate the relative sensitivity to fire among different groups using a systematic review methodology that included critiquing the literature with respect to survey design and statistical analysis. Overall, small mammal abundance is slightly higher, and demographic parameters more favourable, in unburnt sites compared to burnt sites. This was more pronounced in species with body size range of 101-1000 g and with habitat requirements that are sensitive to fire (e.g. dense ground cover): in 66.6 and 69.7% of pairwise comparisons, abundance or a demographic parameter were higher in unburnt than burnt sites. This systematic review demonstrates that there remains a continued focus on simple shifts in abundance with regards to effect of fire and small mammals, which limits understanding of mechanisms responsible for change. Body size and habitat preference were most important in explaining variation in small mammal species' responses to fire.

AB Carbon exchange across the soil atmosphere interface has major implications for environmental change, but a consensus on the effect of temperature on soil organic matter (SOM) mineralisation remains elusive. In this study we investigated the temperature sensitivities of basal respiration (partitioned into recent and older SOM sources) and of additional SOM mineralisation associated with the addition of labile C to soil (priming effects). Soil samples were incubated at 15, 20, 25 and 30 degrees C, and following a 14 day stabilisation period, daily amendments of C-13-enriched glucose (0.2 mg g(-1) soil) were applied (control treatments received water only). Soils were collected where C4 maize had recently been cultivated across fields which were historically planted with C3 spring barley. This enabled basal SUM mineralisation to be partitioned into recent (<4 years) and older SUM sources using natural abundance (C-3/C-4) delta C-13 signatures of soil CO2 efflux. Priming was quantified as the change in SUM-derived soil CO2 efflux in glucose-amended, relative to control soils, with apparent priming accounted for by delta C-13 analyses of the soil microbial biomass. Basal soil respiration was positively correlated with temperature (Q(10) = 1.6), with increased mineralisation of older SUM entirely responsible for this effect (Q(30) = 2.7). Glucose addition resulted in positive priming of SUM mineralisation at each temperature, but the absolute magnitude of this response was not affected by temperature. The results demonstrate that soil respiration conflates CO2 produced by a number of SUM mineralisation processes, each of which displayed distinct temperature sensitivities. Therefore, accurate prediction of SOM sensitivity to rising global temperatures and their inherent variations are required. This will be particularly the case for priming processes, where their magnitude may be most dependent on indirect effects of temperature on plant inputs to soil. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Root and rhizosphere processes contribute significantly to soil carbon (C) fluxes, yet mechanism by which they do are not well understood. One of the contributing factors to this uncertainty is the lack of understanding about the role of root-derived labile C inputs in influencing soil organic matter (SUM) decomposition. We conducted an experiment to compare the pure impacts of two coniferous species through roots on the soil CO2 efflux and examine the species' response to experimental warming using infrared heaters. Warming markedly increased exudation rates I (mu g C cm(-1) root length h(-1)) and II (mu g C cm(-2) root area h(-1)) in the two species plots; however, the Picea asperata species had significantly higher root exudation rates than that of the Abies faxoniana species, regardless of warming treatment. The differences in the root morphological and physiological traits between the two species could be responsible for this variation in exudation and response to experimental warming. The P. asperata plots had significantly higher soil respiration rates (2.36 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) on average) relative to the A. faxoniana plots (2.02 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) on average). Similarly, the temperature sensitivity of SUM decomposition (Q(10)) was 1.19 times higher in the P. asperata plots than the A. faxoniana plots. The magnitude and direction of warming effects on the soil CO2 efflux varied considerably with tree species. The warming marginally increased the mean soil respiration by 5.3% in the P. asperata plots and significantly decreased the mean soil respiration by 10.8% in the A. faxoniana plots over the 4-year period. Our results collectively provide robust evidence that tree species can differ in their effects on shaping Q(10) and controlling the soil CO2 efflux via root exudation, thereby implying altered patterns of soil C cycle between tree species in response to global warming. This calls for incorporating root-derived C inputs in controlling the microbial regulation of SUM decomposition in climate-carbon models to better predict soil C dynamics under global environmental change.

AB This study aims to establish, evaluate, and apply a modern pollen-climate transfer function from the transition zone between arctic tundra and light-needled taiga in Arctic Siberia. Lacustrine samples (n = 96) from the northern Siberian lowlands of Yakutia were collected along four north-to-south transects crossing the arctic forest line. Samples span a broad temperature and precipitation gradient (mean July temperature, T-July: 7.5-18.7 degrees C; mean annual precipitation, P-ann: 114-315 mm/yr). Redundancy analyses are used to examine the relationship between the modern pollen signal and corresponding vegetation types and climate. Performance of transfer functions for T-July and P-ann were cross-validated and tested for spatial autocorrelation effects. The root mean square errors of prediction are 1.67 degrees C for T-July and 40 mm/yr for P-ann. A climate reconstruction based on fossil pollen spectra from a Siberian Arctic lake sediment core spanning the Holocene yielded cold conditions for the Late Glacial (1-2 degrees C below present T-July). Warm and moist conditions were reconstructed for the early to mid Holocene (2 degrees C higher T-July than present), and climate conditions similar to modern ones were reconstructed for the last 4000 years. In conclusion, our modern pollen data set fills the gap of existing regional calibration sets with regard to the underrepresented Siberian tundra-taiga transition zone. The Holocene climate reconstruction indicates that the temperature deviation from modern values was only moderate despite the assumed Arctic sensitivity to present climate change.

AB Aim Sufficient data to describe spatial distributions of rare and threatened populations are typically difficult to obtain. For example, there are minimal modern offshore sightings of the endangered southern right whale, limiting our knowledge of foraging grounds and habitat use patterns. Using historical exploitation data of southern right whales (SRW), we aim to better understand their seasonal offshore distribution patterns in relation to broad-scale oceanography, and to predict their exposure to shipping traffic and response to global climate change.
   Location Australasian region between 130 W and 100 E, and 30 S and 55 S.
   Methods We model 19th century whaling data with boosted regression trees to determine functional responses of whale distribution relative to environmental factors. Habitat suitability maps are generated and we validate these predictions with independent historical and recent sightings. We identify areas of increased risk of ship-strike by integrating predicted whale distribution maps with shipping traffic patterns. We implement predicted ocean temperatures for the 2090-2100 decade in our models to predict changes in whale distribution due to climate change.
   Results Temperature in the upper 200 m, distance from the subtropical front, mixed layer depth, chlorophyll concentration and distance from ridges are the most consistent and influential predictors of whale distribution. Validation tests of predicted distributions determined generally high predictive capacity. We identify two areas of increased risk of vessel strikes and predict substantial shifts in habitat suitability and availability due to climate change.
   Main conclusions Our results represent the first quantitative description of the offshore foraging habitat of SRW. Conservation applications include identifying areas and causes of threats to SRW, generating effective mitigation strategies, and directing population monitoring and research efforts. Our study demonstrates the benefits of incorporating unconventional datasets such as historical exploitation data into species distribution models to inform management and help combat biodiversity loss.

AB Aim Spatial and temporal variations in the composition of freshwater invertebrate assemblages may be useful indicators of past climate change and help us to predict species responses to future climate change. The objective of this study was to understand the relationship between climate variables and fossil Cladocera assemblages in lake sediments along a contemporary climate gradient from hemiboreal to subarctic ecoregions in Finland and throughout the Holocene climate succession.
   Location Seventy-three small shallow lakes across a climate gradient from hemiboreal (60 degrees N) to subarctic (70 degrees N) Finland and a case study lake, Lake Arapisto, in south boreal Finland.
   Methods Fossil cladoceran assemblages were analysed from the surface sediments of 73 lakes to investigate their association with climate, using ordination techniques (detrended correspondence analysis and redundancy analysis) and generalized linear modelling (GLM). The long-term variation of the abundance of specific climate-sensitive cladoceran species was then analysed in a sediment core from a boreal lake and compared with a chironomid-based Holocene temperature reconstruction from an adjacent lake.
   Results Mean July air temperature was identified as a significant variable in explaining species distribution across the spatial climate gradient. This result, together with GLMs that recognized several climate-sensitive species, indicates that certain cladoceran taxa may be useful indicators of climate. For example, the planktonic Bosmina longirostris and the phytophilous Graptoleberis testudinaria were more abundant in the warm southern lakes, in contrast to the benthic Alona affinis and Alona intermedia, which were typical for the cold northern lakes. The surface-sediment inferences were supported by the core analysis from Lake Arapisto, because species associated with cold lakes increased in abundance during the cold early Holocene, and species associated with warm lakes thrived during the Holocene Thermal Maximum and Anthropocene.
   Main conclusions The spatio-temporal distribution of Cladocera is regulated by regional climate, and therefore the species-climate relationships in space and time can be used to interpret past, present and future distributional patterns under a changing climate.

AB In recent years, there has been increasing interest in modelling of species abundance data in addition to presence data. In this study, we assessed the similarities and differences between presence-absence distributions and abundance distributions along similar environmental gradients, derived, respectively, from presence-absence and abundance data. Moreover, we examined the possibility of using presence-absence distribution models to derive abundance distributions. For this purpose, we used Braun-Blanquet abundance scores for 243 vascular species at 10 996 French forest sites. Species distribution models were used to analyse the link between the patterns of occurrence, low abundance and high abundance for each species with regard to mean annual temperature, June water balance, and soil pH. For each species, differences in the modelled distributions were characterised by the ecological optimum and ecological amplitude. A comparison of the presence-absence and abundance distributions for all species revealed similar optima and different amplitudes along the three ecological factors. An abundant-centre distribution was observed in environmental space, with species abundance being greatest at the optimal conditions and lower at less favourable conditions of the species occurrence response. Geographical habitat mapping also shows centred, high-abundance suitability within the presence habitat of each species. We conclude that species distribution models derived from presence-absence data provide useful information about the ecological optima of abundance distributions but overestimate the range of habitats suitable for high species abundance. This study demonstrates the utility of presence-absence data for ecologist and conservation biologist when they are interested in the optimal conditions of high species abundance.

AB Successful conservation plans are conditioned by our ability to detect anthropogenic change in space and time and various statistical analyses have been developed to handle this critical issue. The main objective of this paper is to illustrate a new approach for spatial analysis in conservation biology. Here, we propose a two-step protocol. First, we introduce a new disturbance metric which provides a continuous measure of disturbance for any focal communities on the basis of the surrounding landscape matrix. Second, we use this new gradient to estimate species and community disturbance thresholds by implementing a recently developed method called Threshold Indicator Taxa ANalysis (TITAN). TITAN detects changes in species distributions along environmental gradients using indicators species analysis and assesses synchrony among species change points as evidence for community thresholds. We demonstrate our method with soil arthropod assemblages along a disturbance gradient in Terceira Island (Azores, Portugal). We show that our new disturbance metric realistically reflects disturbance patterns, especially in buffer zones (ecotones) between land use categories. By estimating species disturbance thresholds with TITAN along the disturbance gradient in Terceira, we show that species significantly associated with low disturbance differ from those associated with high disturbance in their biogeographical origin (endemics, non-endemic natives and exotics) and taxonomy (order). Finally, we suggest that mapping the disturbance community thresholds may reveal areas of primary interest for conservation, since these may host indigenous species sensitive to high disturbance levels. This new framework may be useful when: (1) both local and regional processes are to be reflected on single disturbance measures; (2) these are better quantified in a continuous gradient; (3) mapping disturbance of large regions using fine scales is necessary; (4) indicator species for disturbance are searched for and; (5) community thresholds are useful to understand the global dynamics of habitats.

AB Rubus subgen. Rubus includes common European species with highly complicated taxonomy, ongoing hybridisation and facultative apomixis. Out of approximately 750 species recognised in Europe, only 3 diploid sexual species are known, along with numerous apomictic brambles that are highly connected to polyploidy. One exception of a tetraploid taxon is R. ser. Glandulosi, which is known for prevalent sexuality. This taxon highly hybridises with tetraploid members of R. ser. Discolores and leads to the origin of many hybridogenous populations and individuals. In this study, we verify reproduction modes in different diploid, triploid and tetraploid species of subgen. Rubus, with focus on taxa putatively involved in such hybridisation by applying flow cytometric seed screen analysis. We found 100 % sexuality of diploid species, whereas triploid species had obligate unreduced embryo sac development. In contrast, tetraploid plants had varying degrees of sexuality. Additionally, we discovered that R. bifrons has the ability to undergo a reproduction mode switch as a reaction to environmental conditions. These results provide insight into reproductive modes of European brambles and shed light on their reticulate evolution and speciation.

AB Failure of organisms to adapt to sudden environmental changes may lead to extinction. The type of mating system, by affecting fertility and the strength of sexual selection, may have a major impact on a population's chances to adapt and survive. Here, we use experimental evolution in bulb mites (Rhizoglyphus robini) to examine the effects of the mating system on population performance under environmental change. We demonstrate that populations in which monogamy was enforced suffered a dramatic fitness decline when evolving at an increased temperature, whereas the negative effects of change in a thermal environment were alleviated in polygamous populations. Strikingly, within 17 generations, all monogamous populations experiencing higher temperature went extinct, whereas all polygamous populations survived. Our results show that the mating system may have dramatic effects on the risk of extinction under environmental change.

AB Predicting the response of faunal communities to fire presents a challenge for land managers worldwide because the post-fire responses of species may vary between locations and fire events. Post-fire recovery can occur via nucleated recovery from in situ surviving populations or by colonization from ex situ populations. Fine-scale spatial patterns in the patchiness of fires and the proximity of burnt sites to source populations may contribute to both the variability in post-fire responses and the processes by which populations recover. We examined the avifauna at recently burnt sites within extensive semi-arid shrublands of south-eastern Australia, including 72 sites <?5 years since fire and 26 sites 10 years since fire. Study sites represented a gradient of increasing distance from unburnt vegetation (i.e. >?27 years since fire) and varied in the presence or absence of small (25900?m2) unburnt patches of vegetation. For sites <?5 years since fire, species richness was higher at sites closer to unburnt vegetation and at sites containing unburnt patches. These patterns were no longer evident at sites of 10 years since fire. The probability of occurrence of three of seven bird species modelled decreased with increasing distance to unburnt vegetation, but this pattern was evident only at sites burnt uniformly. One species was found almost exclusively at patchily burnt sites. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that proximity to unburnt vegetation enhances post-fire occupancy, and that colonization from ex situ populations is an important process for post-fire recovery of avifauna. Additionally, small unburnt patches enhance the rapid recovery of assemblages post-fire. These patterns are important for understanding the dynamics of post-fire population recovery. We recommend that management of fire for ecological purposes should explicitly consider the role that the spatial attributes of fires play in determining the post-fire community.

AB Socio-economic factors have significant influences on air quality and are commonly used to guide environmental planning and management. Based on data from 85 long-term daily monitoring cities in China, air quality as evaluated by AOFDAQ-A (Annual Occurrence Frequency of Daily Air Quality above Level III), was correlated to socio-economic variable groups of urbanization, pollution and environmental treatment by variation partitioning and hierarchical partitioning methods. We found: (1) the three groups explained 43.5% of the variance in AOFDAQ-A; (2) the contribution of "environmental investment" to AOFDAQ-A shown a time lag effect; (3) "population in mining sector" and "coverage of green space in built-up area" were respectively the most significant negative and positive explanatory socioeconomic variables; (4) using eight largest contributing individual factors, a linear model to predict variance in AOFDAQ-A was constructed. Results from our study provide a valuable reference for the management and control of air quality in Chinese cities. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Previous research on the effects of tree species on soil processes has focused primarily on the role of leaf litter inputs and relatively few studies have considered the importance of plant roots and their associated ecological processes, especially under climate change. We therefore conducted an experiment to compare the impacts of two coniferous species via roots on soil N transformations and their responses to experimental warming using infrared heaters in the Eastern Tibetan Plateau. The infrared heater on average enhanced both air temperature and soil temperature by 2.0 degrees C and 3.7 degrees C, respectively. Warming did not affect soil organic C (SOC), total N (TN), microbial biomass C (MBC) and N (MBN), or their ratios (MBC/MBN) in both coniferous species plots. Effects of experimental warming on soil N availability varied with tree species and sampling dates. There were higher NO3- and lower NH4- concentrations in the Picea asperata than in the Abies faxoniana plots irrespective of warming treatment or sampling date, possibly caused by higher gross nitrification and denitrification rates in the P. asperata. Experimental warming significantly increased the net mineralization, net nitrification and denitrification rates on most sampling times in both species plots. Responses of gross nitrification to experimental warming significantly differed between the two species, and depended strongly on seasons. Gross nitrification and denitrification rates were markedly greater in the P. asperata than in the A. faxoniana plots, with P. asperata being more sensitive than A. faxoniana in response to experimental warming. Differences in the root morphology (i.e., root length, root type) and activity (i.e., root exudation, fine root vigor) between the two species could be largely responsible for the variation in the soil N cycling and its response to experimental warming. Taken together, our results indicate that tree species can differ in their effects on soil transformations and nutrient availability via roots and associated microbial processes. Further research is required regarding the exact mechanisms of tree species effects via roots on soil processes and function under climate change. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In most agro-ecosystems the organisms that feed on plant roots have an important impact on crop yield and can impose tremendous costs to farmers. Similar to aboveground pests, they rely on a broad range of chemical cues to locate their host plant. In their turn, plants have co-evolved a large arsenal of direct and indirect defense to face these attacks. For instance, insect herbivory induces the synthesis and release of specific volatile compounds in plants. These volatiles have been shown to be highly attractive to natural enemies of the herbivores, such as parasitoids, predators, or entomopathogenic nematodes. So far few of the key compounds mediating these so-called tritrophic interactions have been identified and only few genes and biochemical pathways responsible for the production of the emitted volatiles have been elucidated and described. Roots also exude chemicals that directly impact belowground herbivores by altering their behavior or development. Many of these compounds remain unknown, but the identification of, for instance, a key compound that triggers nematode egg hatching to some plant parasitic nematodes has great potential for application in crop protection. These advances in understanding the chemical emissions and their role in ecological signaling open novel ways to manipulate plant exudates in order to enhance their natural defense properties. The potential of this approach is discussed, and we identify several gaps in our knowledge and steps that need to be taken to arrive at ecologically sound strategies for belowground pest management.

AB A long-established theoretical result states that, for a given total canopy nitrogen (N) content, canopy photosynthesis is maximized when the within-canopy gradient in leaf N per unit area (N-a) is equal to the light gradient. However, it is widely observed that N-a declines less rapidly than light in real plant canopies. Here we show that this general observation can be explained by optimal leaf acclimation to light subject to a lower-bound constraint on the leaf mass per area (m(a)). Using a simple model of the carbon-nitrogen (C-N) balance of trees with a steady-state canopy, we implement this constraint within the framework of the MAXX optimization hypothesis that maximizes net canopy C export. Virtually all canopy traits predicted by MAXX (leaf N gradient, leaf N concentration, leaf photosynthetic capacity, canopy N content, leaf-area index) are in close agreement with the values observed in a mature stand of Norway spruce trees (Picea abies L. Karst.). An alternative upper-bound constraint on leaf photosynthetic capacity (A(sat)) does not reproduce the canopy traits of this stand. MAXX subject to a lower bound on m(a) is also qualitatively consistent with co-variations in leaf N gradient, m(a) and A(sat) observed across a range of temperate and tropical tree species. Our study highlights the key role of constraints in optimization models of plant function.

AB Lichens, symbiotic associations of fungi (mycobionts) and green algae or cyanobacteria (photobionts), are poikilohydric organisms that are particularly well adapted to withstand adverse environmental conditions. Terrestrial ecosystems of the Antarctic are therefore largely dominated by lichens. The effects of global climate change are especially pronounced in the maritime Antarctic and it may be assumed that the lichen vegetation will profoundly change in the future. The genetic diversity of populations is closely correlated to their ability to adapt to changing environmental conditions and to their future evolutionary potential. In this study, we present evidence for low genetic diversity in Antarctic mycobiont and photobiont populations of the widespread lichen Cetraria aculeata. We compared between 110 and 219 DNA sequences from each of three gene loci for each symbiont. A total of 222 individuals from three Antarctic and nine antiboreal, temperate and Arctic populations were investigated. The mycobiont diversity is highest in Arctic populations, while the photobionts are most diverse in temperate regions. Photobiont diversity decreases significantly towards the Antarctic but less markedly towards the Arctic, indicating that ecological factors play a minor role in determining the diversity of Antarctic photobiont populations. Richness estimators calculated for the four geographical regions suggest that the low genetic diversity of Antarctic populations is not a sampling artefact. Cetraria aculeata appears to have diversified in the Arctic and subsequently expanded its range into the Southern Hemisphere. The reduced genetic diversity in the Antarctic is most likely due to founder effects during long-distance colonization.

AB Mediterranean climates predispose aquatic systems to both flood and drought periods, therefore, stream sediments may be exposed to desiccation periods. Changes in oxygen concentrations and sediment water content influence the biotic processes implicated in nitrogen dynamics. The objectives of this study were to identify (1) the changes of inorganic nitrogen in stream sediments during the transition from wet to dry conditions, and (2) the underlying processes in N dynamics and its regulation. Extractable sediment NO3 (-)-N and NH4 (+)-N, organic matter and extractable organic carbon content were assessed during natural desiccation in microcosms with sediments from an intermittent Mediterranean stream. In agreement with our initial hypothesis, our results showed how the NO3 (-)-N content of the sediment was enhanced during the first 10 days of sediment drying, whereas NH4 (+)-N was lost by 14 days post-drying. During the first 10 days, sediment desiccation seemed to stimulate the net N-mineralization and net nitrification from sediments. Afterwards, the extractable NO3 (-)-N concentration sharply dropped, which may be attributed to lower ammonium-oxidation rates as ammonium and organic matter are depleted, and to an increase in NO3 (-)-N consumption by microbial populations. Denitrification was inhibited, with a significant decrease as % water-filled pore space lowered. We hypothesize that the sediment inorganic N content enhanced during sediment desiccation could be released as part of the N pulse observed after sediment rewetting. However, the stream N availability after rewetting dried sediments would differ depending on desiccation period duration.

AB A previously unsurveyed calcrete aquifer in the Yilgarn region of Western Australia revealed an unprecedented diversity of copepods, representing 67% of that previously recorded in this whole region. Especially diverse was the genus Schizopera, with up to four morphospecies per bore and a significant size difference between them. Aims of this study were to: (1) survey the extent of this diversity using morphological and molecular tools; (2) derive a molecular phylogeny based on COI; and (3) investigate whether high diversity is a result of an explosive radiation, repeated colonisations, or both, size differentiation is a result of parallel evolution or different phylogeny, and whether Schizopera is a recent invasion in inland waters. More than 300 samples were analysed and the COI fragment successfully amplified by PCR from 43 specimens. Seven species and one subspecies are described as new, and three possible cryptic species were detected. Reconstructed phylogenies reveal that both explosive radiation and multiple colonisations are responsible for this richness, and that Schizopera is probably a recent invasion in these habitats. No evidence for parallel evolution was found, interspecific size differentiation being a result of different phylogeny. Sister species have parapatric distributions and show niche partitioning in the area of overlap.

AB Marine conservation activities around the globe are largely undertaken in the absence of comprehensive species-specific information. To address this gap, complete regional species assemblages of major marine taxa are being progressively assessed against the Categories and Criteria of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species. The present study is the first analysis of entire major components of the biota of a large marine biogeographic region conducted in the Tropical Eastern Pacific (TEP). It is based on recently completed IUCN Red List assessments for all known species of bony and cartilaginous shorefishes, corals, mangroves, and seagrasses in the TEP. Twelve percent of the >1600 species assessed are in threatened categories, indicative of elevated extinction risk. Spatial analysis of all assessed taxonomic groups, including previous IUCN Red List assessments for seabirds, marine mammals, and marine turtles, highlights specific geographical areas of elevated threatened-species richness. The distribution of threatened species in the TEP is primarily linked to areas with high rates of overfishing, habitat loss, and increasing El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) event impacts, as well as oceanic islands with high stochastic risk factors for endemic species. Species assigned to the highest threat categories have life history traits that likely decrease their resilience to various regional and site-specific threats. Comprehensive information in the form of IUCN Red List assessments combined with spatial analysis will greatly help to refine both site- and species-specific marine conservation priorities in the TEP.

AB The "Law of the Minimum" states that growth is controlled by the scarcest resource (limiting factor). This concept was originally applied to plant or crop growth (Justus von Liebig, 1840, Salisbury, Plant physiology, 4th edn., Wadsworth, Belmont, 1992) and quantitatively supported by many experiments. Some generalizations based on more complicated "dose-response" curves were proposed. Violations of this law in natural and experimental ecosystems were also reported. We study models of adaptation in ensembles of similar organisms under load of environmental factors and prove that violation of Liebig's law follows from adaptation effects. If the fitness of an organism in a fixed environment satisfies the Law of the Minimum then adaptation equalizes the pressure of essential factors and, therefore, acts against the Liebig's law. This is the the Law of the Minimum paradox: if for a randomly chosen pair "organism-environment" the Law of the Minimum typically holds, then in a well-adapted system, we have to expect violations of this law.
   For the opposite interaction of factors (a synergistic system of factors which amplify each other), adaptation leads from factor equivalence to limitations by a smaller number of factors.
   For analysis of adaptation, we develop a system of models based on Selye's idea of the universal adaptation resource (adaptation energy). These models predict that under the load of an environmental factor a population separates into two groups (phases): a less correlated, well adapted group and a highly correlated group with a larger variance of attributes, which experiences problems with adaptation. Some empirical data are presented and evidences of interdisciplinary applications to econometrics are discussed.

AB Aim To assess the influence of natural environmental factors and historic and current anthropogenic processes as determinants of vegetation distributions at a continental scale.
   Location Africa.
   Methods Boosted regression trees (BRTs) were used to model the distribution of African vegetation types, represented by remote-sensing-based land-cover (LC) types, as a function of environmental factors. The contribution of each predictor variable to the best models and the accuracy of all models were assessed. Subsequently, to test for anthropogenic vegetation transformation, the relationship between the number of BRT false presences per grid cell and human impact was evaluated using hurdle models. Finally, the relative contributions of environmental, current and historic anthropogenic factors on vegetation distribution were assessed using regression-based variation partitioning.
   Results Deserts and evergreen forests were best predicted by environmental variables, though most other LC classes were also relatively well predicted by the environment. Annual precipitation emerged as the most important determinant of all LC classes. At low rainfall levels, LC classes with increasing woody cover replaced each other as rainfall increased, while LC class rainfall optima overlapped at high rainfall levels. With some exceptions, anthropogenic factors had a relatively small influence on the distribution of most LC classes. However, anthropogenic factors did have an influence on the inaccuracies in BRT models, and these models provided an indication of which LC classes have been most reduced by transformation.
   Main conclusions Here we show, for the first time, how environmental and anthropogenic factors influence vegetation distribution across Africa. LC classes at rainfall extremes are best predicted by the environment. In addition, we corroborate, also for the first time, the much-stated claim that rainfall is the most important variable for the distribution of African vegetation for all African vegetation types. Finally, we indicate how anthropogenic drivers affect LC distributions.

AB Mate selection for inbreeding avoidance is documented in several taxa. In mammals, most conclusive evidence comes from captive experiments that control for the availability of mates and for the level of genetic relatedness between mating partners. However, the importance of mate selection for inbreeding avoidance as a determinant of siring success in the wild has rarely been addressed. We followed the reproduction of a wild population of eastern chipmunks (Tamias striatus) during five breeding seasons between 2006 and 2009. Using molecular tools and parentage assignment methods, we found that multiple paternity (among polytocous litters) varied from 25% in an early-spring breeding season when less than a quarter of females in the population were reproductively active to 100% across three summer breeding seasons and one spring breeding season when more than 85% of females were reproductively active. Genetically related parents were common in this population and produced less heterozygous offspring. Furthermore, litters with multiple sires showed a higher average relatedness among partners than litters with only a single sire. In multiply sired litters, however, males that were more closely related to their partners sired fewer offspring. Our results corroborate findings from captive experiments and suggest that selection for inbreeding avoidance can be an important determinant of reproductive success in wild mammals.

AB Tropical dry forests (TDFs) host a large diversity of tree species but little is known of potential mechanisms that contribute to its maintenance. Given the paramount importance of water availability in such forests, tree species would be expected to show nonrandom patterns along water availability gradients, as well as differential individual species responses. In this work we explored whether that was true for 50 dominant tree species. Within a total area of 5.2 ha, divided into 26 transects each with ten 20 x 10 m plots, we registered presence-absence of these tree species with diameter at breast height >= 5 cm. We assessed the response of trees to four environmental variables differentially related to water availability in three steps: (1) identifying the shape of the response to individual environmental variables, (2) testing for artifacts in previous patterns due to spatial autocorrelation of presence-absence, and (3) identifying the environmental variable or combination of variables that best explained the pattern. We then classified the species with respect to their probability of occurrence along the gradient, and explored which components of the water cycle were likely to be driving the observed patterns. We found that 14 species were generalists, 16 drought tolerant, 9 intermediate, 3 water demanding and 8 showed mixed responses. Lateral flow and access to ground water most likely underlie such patterns. Our results confirm the key role played by water availability in tree species distribution. Water-related niche differentiation seems to be crucial for maintaining the high diversity of this TDF.

AB Low-elevation islands face threats from sea level rise (SLR) and increased storm intensity. Evidence of endangered species' population declines and shifts in vegetation communities are already underway in the Florida Keys. SLR predictions indicate large areas of these habitats may be eliminated in the next century. Using the Florida Keys as a model system, we present a process for evaluating conservation options for rare and endemic taxa. Considering species characteristics and habitat, we assess central issues that influence conservation options. We contrast traditional and controversial options for two animal and two plant species giving special emphasis to perceptions of ecological risk and safety from SLR and suggest courses of action. Multiple strategies will be required to spread extinction risk and will be effective for different time periods. Global climate change presents an uncertain, perhaps no-analog future that will challenge land managers and practitioners to re-evaluate equilibrium-state-conceived laws and policies not only for these taxa, but for many facing similar threats. To embrace conservation in a changing world will require a new dialogue that includes controversial ideas, a review of existing laws and policies, and preparation for the oncoming change.

AB Natural hydrological variability in lotic ecosystems can include prolonged periods of flow recession. A reduction in discharge is accompanied by abiotic changes in benthic and hyporheic habitats, often including reductions in habitat availability. Whilst the benthic invertebrate community response to low flows is well documented, little research has considered how the composition of the community within the hyporheic zone is affected. We examined benthic and hyporheic invertebrate community composition during flow recession in a temperate karst stream, at sites with contrasting historic flow permanence regimes. Changes in benthic invertebrate community composition primarily reflected changes in habitat availability associated with discharge variability; in particular, the population density of the dominant amphipod, Gammarus pulex, increased as the area of submerged benthic sediments declined. Concurrent significant increases in the hyporheic abundance of G. pulex, and moderate increase in the proportion of the total G. pulex population inhabiting the hyporheic zone were recorded. It is postulated that G. pulex migrated into the hyporheic zone to reduce exposure to intensifying biological interactions in the benthic sediments. An increase in the hyporheic abundance of G. pulex was particularly pronounced at sites with historic intermittent flow, which could be attributed to downwelling stream water dominating vertical hydrologic exchange. The increase in G. pulex abundance reduced community diversity in the benthic sediments, but had no apparent detrimental effects on hyporheic invertebrate assemblages.

AB Blue marlin are distributed throughout tropical and temperate waters in the Pacific Ocean. The preference of this species for particular habitats may affect its distribution and vulnerability to being caught. The relationships between the spatial pattern of blue marlin abundance and oceanographic conditions, which may be influenced by climate change, were examined using generalized additive models fitted to catch and effort data from longline fisheries. Distributions of blue marlin density, based on combining the probability of presence and abundance given presence, indicate that there is annual variation in the distribution of blue marlin and that the population apparently moved east during the 1997-1998 El Nino. The interannual variability in blue marlin distribution appears to be associated with El Nino events and is related to shifts in sea surface temperature and the deepening of the thermocline. Models of catch and effort that include oceanographic variables could be used, given predictions from climate models, to explore future changes in distribution, which could then be used to provide management advice related to time-area closures.

AB The use of shallow geothermal energy is a thriving technology. Still, its impact on the ecology of subsurface habitats has not been adequately investigated. Biological processes are substantially influenced by temperature. In field and laboratory investigations comprising a temperature range from 2 to 45 degrees C we show, that the diversity and structure of aquifer microbial communities is significantly influenced by temperature. Microbial biomass and activities are shown to additionally depend on the availability of nutrients and substrates in the groundwater. Selected groundwater invertebrates exhibited little tolerance towards mid-and long-term exposure to increased temperatures. Our results allow first recommendations towards the design, authorization, construction and operation of shallow geothermal energy facilities in an ecologically sustainable way.

AB Acknowledgment that the matrix matters in conserving wildlife in human-modified landscapes is increasing. However, the complex interactions of habitat loss, habitat fragmentation, habitat condition and land use have confounded attempts to disentangle the relative importance of properties of the landscape mosaic, including the matrix. To this end, we controlled for the amount of remnant forest habitat and the level of fragmentation to examine mammal species richness in human-modified landscapes of varying levels of matrix development intensity and patch attributes. We postulated seven alternative models of various patch habitat, landscape and matrix influences on mammal species richness and then tested these models using generalized linear mixed-effects models within an information theoretic framework. Matrix attributes were the most important determinants of terrestrial mammal species richness; matrix development intensity had a strong negative effect and vegetation structural complexity of the matrix had a strong positive effect. Distance to the nearest remnant forest habitat was relatively unimportant. Matrix habitat attributes are potentially a more important indicator of isolation of remnant forest patches than measures of distance to the nearest patch. We conclude that a structurally complex matrix within a human-modified landscape can provide supplementary habitat resources and increase the probability of movement across the landscape, thereby increasing mammal species richness in modified landscapes.

AB Plants can respond to environmental impacts by variation in functional traits, thereby increasing their performance relative to neighbors. We hypothesized that trait adjustment should also occur in response to influences of the biotic environment, in particular different plant diversity of the community. We used 12 legume species as a model and assessed their variation in morphological, physiological, life-history and performance traits in experimental grasslands of different plant species (1, 2, 4, 8, 16 and 60) and functional group (1-4) numbers. Mean trait values and their variation in response to plant diversity varied among legume species and from trait to trait. The tall-growing Onobrychis viciifolia showed little trait variation in response to increasing plant diversity, whereas the species with shorter statures responded in apparently adaptive ways. The formation of longer shoots with elongated internodes, increased biomass allocation to supporting tissue at the cost of leaf mass, reduced branching, higher specific leaf areas and lower foliar delta C-13 values indicated increasing efforts for light acquisition in more diverse communities. Although leaf nitrogen concentrations and shoot biomass:nitrogen ratios were not affected by increasing plant diversity, foliar delta N-15 values of most legumes decreased and the application of the N-15 natural abundance method suggested that they became more reliant on symbiotic N-2 fixation. Some species formed fewer inflorescences and delayed flowering with increasing community diversity. The observed variation in functional traits generally indicated strategies of legumes to optimize light and nutrient capturing, but they were largely species-dependent and only partly attributable to increasing canopy height and community biomass with increasing plant diversity. Thus, the analysis of individual plant species and their adjustment to growth conditions in communities of increasing plant diversity is essential to get a deeper insight into the mechanisms behind biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships.

AB Many species of non-flying mammal depend on tree hollows (cavities or holes) for shelter and survival. I reviewed the published literature on tree hollow use by Australian non-flying arboreal and scansorial mammals to provide a synthesis of tree hollow requirements, to identify gaps in knowledge and to stimulate future research that may improve the management of these species. The use of hollows was described in some detail for 18 of 42 hollow-using species. Most information was for possums and gliding possums, whereas dasyurid marsupials and rodents were largely neglected. The paucity of data for many species must be addressed because it represents an impediment to their conservation. Hollow abundance appears to be the primary determinant of tree preferences. This accounts for the frequent use of standing dead trees by most species. Most hollow-bearing trees used as dens were at least 100 years of age. Further studies that describe the dynamic processes that govern the availability of tree hollows are needed. The few studies that document attrition of hollow-bearing trees suggest that land managers need to improve strategies for the effective retention and long-term replacement of these trees.

AB The amount (composition) and spatial arrangement (configuration) of forest patches in fragmented landscapes influence the accessibility, as well as the abundance and diversity of resources available to bats. Moreover, tropical fruit and insect abundance differ seasonally in response to changes in precipitation, and many bats in the family Phyllostomidae employ seasonal reproductive strategies. Because reproductive activities involve constraints on time and energy as well as increased nutritional demands, foraging behavior and home range size may differ between wet and dry seasons. Nonetheless, seasonal variation in response to landscape structure by bats has not been examined previously. Consequently, population-, ensemble- and assemblage-level responses of phyllostomids to landscape composition and configuration were quantified separately during the wet and dry season at three circular focal scales (1, 3 and 5 km radii) for 14 sites in fragmented lowland Amazon forest. Responses to landscape characteristics were scale-dependent, species-specific, and seasonal. Abundances of frugivores responded to landscape composition in the dry season and to landscape configuration in the wet season. Conversely, abundances of animalivores responded to landscape configuration in the dry season and to landscape composition in the wet season. Divergent responses to landscape structure between seasons suggest that variation in resource abundance and diversity play a significant role in structuring population-, ensemble- and assemblage-level patterns. As such, considerations of the effects of dietary flexibility and reproductive constraints on foraging strategies and habitat use may be important when designing management plans that successfully promote long-term persistence of biodiversity in fragmented landscapes.

AB Species distribution modelling can be a powerful tool in species conservation. Przewalski's gazelle Procapra przewalskii is an endangered ungulate and a conservation focus on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. To identify the potential range and provide a conservation base for the species, we used the maximum entropy approach to build a habitat suitability map and took into account: (1) the comparison among three competing models (the full, uncorrelated and pruned models) with different sets of environmental predictors; and (2) scale effects on model spatial output and performance. Elevation, maximum temperature of the warmest month, mean temperature of the wettest and warmest quarter and isothermality were the five most effective predictors. The 11 threshold-determining approaches identified different thresholds. Spatial patterns of ranges predicted with the three models were similar, although the uncorrelated model was outperformed by the other two models. All three models identified regions in the eastern part of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau as the most suitable habitat for Przewalski's gazelle. Cross-validation area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of the full model decreased slightly as the scale increased; spatial congruence AUC fluctuated with the small range, and the predicted range increased disproportionately. This study identifies areas to find new populations and representative habitats of a rare and endangered species.

AB Dense ungulate populations in forest accompanied by high grazing intensities have the potential to affect plant population dynamics, and such herbivory effects on populations are hypothesised to differ along environmental gradients. We investigated red deer grazing and resource interaction effects on the performance and dynamics of the functionally important boreal shrub Vaccinium myrtillus using integral projection models (IPMs). We sampled data from 900 V. myrtillus ramets in 30 plots in two consecutive years across the boreo-nemoral pine forest on the island Svanoy, western Norway. The plots spanned two environmental gradients: a red deer grazing intensity gradient (assessed by Cervus elaphus faecal pellets), and a relative resource gradient (DCA-ordination of species composition). The use of IPMs enabled projections of population growth rate (lambda) using continuous plant size instead of forcing stage division upon the demographic data. We used the environmental gradients as continuous variables to explain the dynamics of V. myrtillus populations and found that both increasing grazing intensity and resource levels negatively affected lambda of the V. myrtillus populations. Interestingly, these factors interacted: the negative effects of grazing were strongest in the resource-rich vegetation, and higher resource levels reduced lambda more strongly than at low resource levels when grazing intensities became higher. Populations with lambda > 1 were projected if the grazing intensity was less than or equal to the mean grazing intensity on the island, and indicated that V. myrtillus is relatively tolerant of grazing. Variance decomposing showed that the decrease of lambda along the grazing gradient, both at low and high resource levels, was largely caused by reductions in plant growth. The use of IPMs together with important environmental gradients offered novel possibilities to study the synthesised effect of different factors on plant population dynamics. Here, we show that the population response of an abundant boreal shrub to ungulate grazing depends on resource level.

AB With a realistic threat against biodiversity in rain forests and in the sea, a sustainable use of natural products is becoming more and more important. Basic research directed against different organisms in Nature could reveal unexpected insights into fundamental biological mechanisms but also new pharmaceutical or biotechnological possibilities of more immediate use. Many different strategies have been used prospecting the biodiversity of Earth in the search for novel structure-activity relationships, which has resulted in important discoveries in drug development. However, we believe that the development of multidisciplinary incentives will be necessary for a future successful exploration of Nature. With this aim, one way would be a modernization and renewal of a venerable proven interdisciplinary science, Pharmacognosy, which represents an integrated way of studying biological systems. This has been demonstrated based on an explanatory model where the different parts of the model are explained by our ongoing research. Anti-inflammatory natural products have been discovered based on ethnopharmacological observations, marine sponges in cold water have resulted in substances with ecological impact, combinatory strategy of ecology and chemistry has revealed new insights into the biodiversity of fungi, in depth studies of cyclic peptides (cyclotides) has created new possibilities for engineering of bioactive peptides, development of new strategies using phylogeny and chemography has resulted in new possibilities for navigating chemical and biological space, and using bioinformatic tools for understanding of lateral gene transfer could provide potential drug targets. A multidisciplinary subject like Pharmacognosy, one of several scientific disciplines bridging biology and chemistry with medicine, has a strategic position for studies of complex scientific questions based on observations in Nature. Furthermore, natural product research based on intriguing scientific questions in Nature can be of value to increase the attraction for young students in modern life science.

AB Small mammals in boreal forest ecosystems fluctuate dramatically in abundance and 1 possible mechanism to explain these changes is the bottom-up hypothesis of variation in food supplies. Here we ask if variation in berry crops produced by 6 major species of dwarf shrubs and herbs, epigeous mushroom crops. and white spruce seeds allow us to predict changes in the abundance of the red-backed vole (Myodes [ = Clethrionomys] the deer mouse (Peromyseus maniculatus), and field voles (Microtus oeconomus and M pennsylvanicus combined) over 13 years (1997-2009) in the Kluane Lake region of the southwestern Yukon, Canada M rutilus is the dominant rodent in these forests. comprising 64% of the catch. Overwinter survival is a key demographic variable in all these rodents, and the winter food supply principally berries produced the previous summer may be I key to overwinter survival We predicted that berry, mushroom, and tree seed crops in year / would produce changes in rodent density in year t + I. We could explain statistically 78-98% of the variation in May and August abundance of all 3 rodent species with indices of berry crops and mushrooms in the previous summer For M rutilus the critical predictor was berry crops of Empetrum nigrum For P maniculatus, the critical species were Arctostaphylos uva-urst, A rubara, and mushrooms. Spruce seed crops were not significantly correlated with rodent densities or changes in density A large fraction of the variation in rodent numbers in this ecosystem is explained by a simple bottom-up model of population limitation.

AB The 2007 Energy Independence and Security Act mandates a five-fold increase in US biofuel production by 2022. Given this ambitious policy target, there is a need for spatially explicit estimates of landscape suitability for growing biofuel feedstocks. We developed a suitability modeling approach for two major US biofuel crops, corn (Zea mays) and switchgrass (Panicum virgatum), based upon the use of two presence-only species distribution models (SDMs): maximum entropy (Maxent) and support vector machines (SVM). SDMs are commonly used for modeling animal and plant distributions in natural environments, but have rarely been used to develop landscape models for cultivated crops. AUC, Kappa, and correlation measures derived from test data indicate that SVM slightly outperformed Maxent in modeling US corn production, although both models produced significantly accurate results. When compared with results from a mechanistic switchgrass model recently developed by Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), SVM results showed higher correlation than Maxent results with models fit using county-scale point inputs of switchgrass production derived from expert opinion estimates. However, Maxent results for an alternative switchgrass model developed with point inputs from research trial sites showed higher correlation to the ORNL model than the corresponding results obtained from SVM. Further analysis indicates that both modeling approaches were effective in predicting county-scale increases in corn production from 2006 to 2007, a time period in which US corn production increased by 24%. We conclude that presence-only methods are a powerful first-cut tool for estimating relative land suitability across geographic regions in which candidate biofuel feedstocks can be grown, and may also provide important insight into potential land-use change patterns likely to be associated with increased biofuel demand.

AB Models of climate change predict that its effects on animal populations will not always be negative, but most studies indicate negative associations between changes in climate and the phenology of animal migration and reproduction. For some populations, however, climate change may render particular environments more favourable, with positive effects on population growth. We used a 30-year population dataset on over 2000 Common Eiders Somateria mollissima at a colony in southwest Iceland to examine the response of this species to climate fluctuations. Eiders are strongly dependent on suitable climatic conditions for successful reproduction and survival. Temperatures in southwest Iceland, in both winter and summer, have generally increased over the past 30 years but have shown considerable fluctuation. We show that females laid earlier following mild winters and that year-to-year variation in the number of nests was related to the temperature during the breeding season 2 years previously. Milder summers could have positive effects on breeding success and offspring survival, producing an increase in nest numbers 2 years later when most Eiders recruit into the breeding population. In this part of their range, Eiders could benefit from a general warming of the climate.

AB Over the past half century, ecologists have tried to unravel the factors that drive species richness patterns in ecological communities. One influential theory is island biogeography theory (IBT), which predicts that island or habitat area and isolation are drivers of species richness. However, relatively few studies testing IBT have considered invertebrate or belowground communities, and it is unclear as to whether the predictions made by IBT hold for these communities. Other theories predict that habitat characteristics such as vegetation diversity may be important drivers of invertebrate species richness. To investigate patterns of invertebrate density and species richness across gradients of area, isolation, and vegetation diversity, we used a system of 30 lake islands in the boreal zone of northern Sweden. We assessed density and taxonomic richness of ground-dwelling spiders, web-building spiders, beetles, collembolans, mites, and nematodes, for all islands during two consecutive summers. For all invertebrate groups, both density and taxonomic richness were either neutrally or negatively related to island size, and either neutrally or positively related to island isolation. Meanwhile the density and taxonomic richness for several groups was positively related to vegetation diversity (i.e. habitat heterogeneity). In multiple regression analyses, island size was often the single best predictor for both invertebrate density and taxonomic richness, but in some cases island size and isolation in combination explained more variation than each factor considered singly. Contrary to IBT predictions, invertebrate density and richness was never positively related to island size or negatively related to island isolation. Instead, our results suggest that plant diversity (and thus habitat heterogeneity) was the main driver of the patterns that we found, although other factors could have some influence. We conclude that several factors, but not necessarily those predicted as important by IBT, are important in determining invertebrate abundance and species richness in island systems.

AB Platycrater arguta (Hydrangeaceae) is a small deciduous Shrub of the Sino-Japanese floristic region, where it Occurs in montane sites mostly covered with warm-temperate deciduous forest. This sole representative of its genus contains two varieties disjunctly distributed between East China (var. sinensis) and South Japan (var. arguta). To illuminate the biogeographic and demographic history of this rare species, we conducted a survey of chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) Sequence variation (trnD-trnE, trnH-psbA) within and among twelve populations (tour from China, eight front Japan, 129 individuals in total) representing the overall distributional range of the species. Based on a total of 19 haplotypes identified, P. arguta was Found to harbor Surprisingly high levels of haplotype and nucleotide diversity (h(T) = 0.882; pi(T) = 0.00475), possibly associated with its long evolutionary history. Spatial analysis of molecular variance found two regional phylogroups, corresponding to var. sinensis and var. arguta, and supported by genealogical (unrooted network) analysis of haplotypes. Using a coalescent-based model of 'divergence by isolation with migration', the likely vicariant origin of these varieties was dated to the mid-Pleistocene (ca. 0.89 mya). Very similar haplotype mismatch distributions indicate that var. sinensis and var. arguta underwent past demographic growth almost simultaneously (dated to ca. 0.43 and 0.45 mya, respectively), suggesting climate-induced expansion. However, var. sinensis likely experienced a mere demographic expansion in a narrowly circumscribed mountain range, while var. arguta underwent a spatial northward expansion that might have consisted of a series of bottlenecks, leading to genetically impoverished populations that most likely derived front initial population(s) in Southern Kyushu. Our results endorse the recognition of two 'evolutionarily significant units' within P, arguta, corresponding to var. sinensis from East China and var. arguta from South Japan.

AB Cost-benefit models predict that carnivory can increase the rate of photosynthesis (A(N)) by leaves of carnivorous plants as a result of increased nitrogen absorption from prey. However, the cost of carnivory includes decreased A(N) and increased respiration rates (R-D) of trapping organs. The principal aim of the present study was to assess the costs and benefits of carnivory in the pitcher plant Nepenthes talangensis, leaves of which are composed of a lamina and a pitcher trap, in response to feeding with beetle larvae.
   Pitchers of Nepenthes grown at 200 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) were fed with insect larvae for 2 months, and the effects on the photosynthetic processes were then assessed by simultaneous measurements of gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence of laminae and pitchers, which were correlated with nitrogen, carbon and total chlorophyll concentrations.
   A(N) and maximum (F-v/F-m) and effective quantum yield of photosystem II (Phi(PSII)) were greater in the fed than unfed laminae but not in the fed compared with unfed pitchers. Respiration rate was not significantly affected in fed compared with unfed plants. The unfed plants had greater non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) of chlorophyll fluorescence. Higher NPQ in unfed lamina did not compensate for their lower Phi(PSII), resulting in lower photochemical quenching (QP) and thus higher excitation pressure on PSII. Biomass and nitrogen and chlorophyll concentration also increased as a result of feeding. The cost of carnivory was shown by lower A(N) and Phi(PSII) in pitchers than in laminae, but R-D depended on whether it was expressed on a dry weight or a surface area basis. Correlation between nitrogen and A(N) in the pitchers was not found. Cost-benefit analysis showed a large beneficial effect on photosynthesis from feeding as light intensity increased from 200 to 1000 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) PAR after which it did not increase further. All fed plants began to flower.
   Feeding pitchers with insect larvae increases A(N) of leaf laminae, due to higher nutrient acquisition, with strong correlation with nitrogen concentration, but A(N) of pitchers does not increase, despite increased nitrogen concentration in their tissue. Increased A(N) improves growth and reproduction and is likely to increase the competitive advantage of carnivorous over non-carnivorous plants in nutrient-poor habitats.

AB Historical mitochondrial introgression causes differences between a species' mitochondrial gene genealogy and its nuclear gene genealogy, making tree-based species delineation ambiguous. Using sequence data from one mitochondrial gene (cytochrome b) and three nuclear genes (introns), we examined the evolutionary history of four high elevation Tibetan megophryid frog species, Scutiger boulengeri, Scutiger glandulatus, Scutiger mammatus and Scutiger tuberculatus. The three nuclear genes shared a similar history but the mitochondrial gene tree suggested a drastically different evolutionary scenario. The conflicts between them were explained by multiple episodes of mitochondrial introgression events via historical interspecific hybridization. 'Foreign' mitochondrial genomes might have been fixed in populations and extended through a large portion of the species' distribution. Some hybridization events were probably as old as 10 Myr, while others were recent. An F-1 hybrid was also identified. Historical hybridization events among the four species appeared to be persistent and were not restricted to the period of Pleistocene glaciation, as in several other well-studied cases. Furthermore, hybridization involved several species and occurred in multiple directions, and there was no indication of one mitochondrial genome being superior to others. In addition, incomplete lineage sorting resulting from budding speciation may have also explained some discrepancies between the mitochondrial DNA and nuclear gene trees. Combining all evidences, the former 'Scutiger mammatus' appeared to be two species, including a new species. With the availability of a wide range of highly variable nuclear gene markers, we recommend using a combination of mitochondrial gene and multiple nuclear genes to reveal a complete species history.

AB Despite the costs of mating, females of most taxa mate with multiple males. Polyandrous females are hypothesized to gain genetic benefits for their offspring, but this assumes paternity bias favoring male genotypes that enhance offspring viability. We determined net male genetic effects on female and offspring fitness in a seed beetle and then tested whether fertilization success was biased in favor of high-quality male genotypes in double mating experiments. Contrary to expectations, high-quality male genotypes consistently had a lower postmating fertilization success in two independent assays. Our results imply that sexually antagonistic adaptations have a major and unappreciated influence on male postmating fertilization success. Such genetic variation renders indirect genetic benefits an unlikely driver of the evolution of polyandry.

AB Survival and growth of the earliest life-stages is considered a key factor in determining the abundance of many marine fish species. For flatfishes, the availability of high quality nursery areas is essential for successful recruitment. Regarding the Baltic Sea, there are large gaps in knowledge on factors that influence the distribution of flatfishes during this sensitive stage. To identify the characteristics of important nursery areas in the Baltic for flounder (Platichthys flesus) and turbot (Psetta maxima), a field survey with push net sampling was conducted in the northern Baltic proper during autumn 2006. The sampling stations were stratified to cover several different habitat types defined by substrate and wave exposure. Apart from density of young-of-the-year (YOY) flatfishes, a number of ecological characteristics of the habitat were recorded. Physical habitat variables included substrate type, salinity, depth, turbidity, vegetation and habitat structure. Variables describing biotic processes, such as prey availability and abundance of competitors, were also sampled. The relationships between the spatial distribution of species and these ecological characteristics were fitted to presence/absence data of juvenile flatfish using generalized additive models (GAM). The best habitat descriptors for flounder in order of contribution were: substrate, habitat structure, salinity, wave exposure and occurrence of filamentous algae. Positive effects of increasing wave exposure, salinity and structure were detected while a high cover of filamentous algae had a negative effect. Sand and gravel were preferred over soft and stony substrates. For turbot the best habitat descriptors in order of contribution were: occurrence of filamentous algae, substrate and turbidity. Turbot showed a preference for areas with a low cover of filamentous algae, high turbidity and sandy substrate. Prey availability and abundance of competitors were not included in the models, indicating that the distribution of flatfishes at the scales studied (tens of kilometres) is mainly governed by physical habitat properties. These results constitute the basis for future efforts on mapping of essential flatfish habitats in the Baltic Sea. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Studies of postcopulatory sexual selection typically estimate a male's fertilization success from his paternity success (P-2) calculated at hatching or birth. However, P-2 may be affected by differential embryo viability, thereby confounding estimations of true fertilization success (F-2) This study examines the effects of variation in the ability of males to influence embryo viability upon the inequality between P-2 and F-2. It also investigates the consequences of this inequality for testing the hypothesis that polyandrous females accrue viability benefits for their offspring through facilitation of sperm competition (good-sperm model). Simulations of competitive mating trials show that although relative measures of male reproductive success tend to underestimate the strength of underlying good-sperm processes, good-sperm processes can be seriously overestimated using P-2 values if males influence the viability of the embryos they sire. This study cautions the interpretation of P-2 values as a proxy for fertilization success or sperm competitiveness in studies of postcopulatory sexual selection, and highlights that the good-sperm hypothesis needs empirical support from studies able to identify and separate unequivocally the males' ability to win fertilizations from their ability to influence the development of embryos.

AB Grain legume production in the Mediterranean Area is threatened by the holoparasitic plant Orobanche crenata, to which little resistance is available in affected crops. Control strategies have centred around agronomic practices and the use of herbicides, although success has been marginal. Several authors have described fenugreek as a suitable crop for intercropping with legumes, reducing the infection level of O. crenata; however, there is an important lack of experimental data and of a systematic research of the mechanisms involved in the reduction of parasitic infection. Two years of field experiments and further investigation by mini-rhizotron and pot experiments showed a decrease of O. crenata infection due to an allelopathic interference on the parasitic life cycle at the level of germination. Inhibition of O. crenata seed germination by allelochemicals released by fenugreek roots is suggested as the mechanism for reduction of O. crenata infection. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Native tree populations have been fragmented by anthropogenic disturbance worldwide, leaving them at risk from extinction. The possibility of sizable recovery of fragmented populations is a function of their dispersal, the abiotic conditions, and the biotic interactions. The relative importance of these three drivers for the recruitment rate of a fragmented population of the late-successional Fagus sylvatica L. was analysed at the landscape scale in Causse du Larzac, southern margins of the Massif Central, in the South of France. We used regression models on observational data to analyse the response of Fagus recruitment rate to the distance to the nearest mature population, to climatic and geological variables, and to variables describing biotic interactions (pine vs. grassland, light, shrub cover). Distance to the nearest F. sylvatica adult population was the most important explanatory variable. Recruitment rate was also influenced by facilitative biotic interactions with shrubs, and by the climatic conditions of the plot. Recruitment occurred at a greater distance from the nearest mature population of Fagus in pine forests than in grassland. Dispersal was the major limitation to recruitment of F. sylvatica in this landscape. The recruitment rate was then modulated by the climate and positive biotic interactions. The activity of the European jay could be of great importance for such fragmented populations, because it can lead to long-distance dispersal events and may result in a preferential dispersal towards pine forests.

AB Amphibians are declining worldwide, but lack of long-term regional data makes identifying possible causes difficult, hindering conservation efforts. We evaluated whether habitat destruction, terrestrial habitat adjacent to ponds and the physico-chemical characteristics of ponds could explain the regional and local decline of the spadefoot toad (Pelobates fuscus) in Sweden.
   Analyses of aerial photos and field observations revealed that out of all of the known calling sites of the species since 1959, 26% did not exist in 2000. The road traffic intensity adjacent to existing ponds indicated that in 1997-2003 it was higher near ponds where calling males had disappeared (N = 240) compared to sites where calling males were present (N = 84). The soil-type adjacent to ponds with calling males was more sandy than at ponds where calling males had disappeared (instead dominated by till). By including road traffic intensity and proportion of sandy soils adjacent to ponds, a logistic regression model correctly classified 82% of the ponds into their correct category.
   Of 36 ponds investigated in 2004, we found evidence of successful reproduction (tadpoles) in 53%. Unsuccessful reproduction seemed to be associated with eutrophication and low coverage of submerged macrophytes. In an area with low road traffic intensity and sandy soils, restoration of ponds started in 1996, and the number of calling males increased from a maximum of 77 in 1993-1996 to 146 in 2006. Our results indicate that habitat destruction has likely contributed to the regional decline of P. fuscus, but also that local factors such as soil type, traffic intensity and reproductive failure may also help explain the decline of the species.

   DENSITY; QUALITY; SUBSOIL; LENGTH; YIELD
AB Since many soils used for growing potatoes in the UK are likely to be close to their plastic limit for cultivation during early spring, there exists the potential for soil compaction to occur during planting which will restrict root penetration. A series of experiments showed that soil compaction delayed emergenc, reduced rate of leaf appearance and ground cover expansion, shortened canopy cover duration and restricted light interception, which combined to reduce tuber yield. Rooting density and maximum depth of rooting were reduced, particularly where compaction was shallow. In some soils, irrigation helped alleviate some of the effects of compaction but in others it exacerbated their severity. Using a cone penetrometer, relationships between rate of root penetration and soil resistance (Omega) were established from a number of experiments and replicated blocks in commercial fields and an overall relationship of the form y = 16 center dot 3-4 center dot 08 Omega mm/day was produced. Root penetration rates of c. 20 mm/day were measured in the intensively-cultivated ridge zone but growth rates were halved at a Omega cf 1 center dot 5 MPa. A survey of 602 commercial fields showed that two thirds of fields had Qs,>= 3 MPa (where root growth rates would be < 2 mm/day) within the top 0 center dot 55 rn of the soil profile. Thus, rooting depth is likely to be considerably shallower than desirable and lead to inefficiency of water and nutrient utilization. The use of powered cultivators to separate stones and clods from beds or ridges and produce a fine seedbed is now almost universally adopted in the UK. However, the system is both time and energy inefficient and increases the risk of creating soil compaction, particularly at shallow depths. All cultivation equipment has been shown to cause compaction and it is suggested that the consequences of the shortening of the growing season from delaying planting by a few days to allow the soil to dry are far less than the yield and quality losses caused by compaction.

AB Capsule The conservation of Red-backed Shrikes on farmland habitats depends on extensive farming conditions.
   Aims To evaluate breeding density and habitat preferences of the declining Red-backed Shrike and relate its occurrence to an environmental gradient ranging from land abandonment to intensive farming.
   Methods The study was carried out in the Apennines (northern Italy), at nine 21-ha study plots. We identified factors affecting breeding density and habitat preferences at two spatial scales (landscape and territory) and analysed the variation in territory density according to the relative farming intensity in a low-intensity agricultural landscape.
   Results The presence of shrubs and cultivated/grazed land positively influenced the number of Red-backed Shrike territories per plot, while the species' settlement within plots was related to higher values of shrub cover and the presence of hedges. Shrike occurrence was associated with land-use categories intermediate between land abandonment and intensive agriculture.
   Conclusions This study provides a first detailed assessment of Red-backed Shrike habitat requirements in southern Europe. Favoured habitats were pasture/cultivation mosaics flanked by or interspersed with shrubs/hedges (15-20% of the surface of the 1-ha medium-sized territory). Thus, the conservation of Red-backed Shrikes in low-intensity southern European farmland appears to reflect a trade-off between agricultural intensification and long-term land abandonment.

AB The Palaeocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) at c. 55.8 Ma marks a transient (c. 100 ka duration) interval of rapid greenhouse warming that had profound effects on marine and terrestrial biota. Plant communities responded rapidly with major compositional turnover. The long-term effects on tropical vegetation communities that stein from the brief period of global warming are unclear. We present pollen data from the paratropical US Gulf Coast (eastern Mississippi, western Alabama and Georgia), which had background Palacogene mean annual temperatures of 26-27 degrees C. Sporomorph data (pollen and spores) demonstrate that taxonomic diversity increases over c. 1 Ma in the Late Palaeocene but this trend is replaced, with the first occurrences of taxa that mark the Early Eocene, by a pronounced extinction into the Early Eocene (c. 20% of the palynoflora). Taxonomic diversity also decreases by up to 38% in the Early Eocene. The timing of the extinction is not clearly resolved but may be restricted to the earliest part of the Early Eocene. Two richness estimators (Chao 2 and Jackknife 2) both demonstrate that Late Palaeocene samples contain significantly more taxa than those in the Early Eocene. Extinction on the US Gulf Coast proves that ancient tropical ecosystems were highly susceptible to changes in diversity mediated directly or indirectly by environmental change even during equable greenhouse climates in the early Palaeogene.

AB Disturbance from boats has been documented for many species of marine mammals, especially cetaceans, but has never been quantified for dugongs. Dugongs depend on seagrass for food. This food mostly occurs in shallow coastal areas where boat traffic is high. Thus there is potential for boats to alienate dugongs from critical habitat areas. Using an overhead video observation system ('blimp-cam'), we observed the behaviour of focal dugongs during controlled boat pass experiments and while no boats were present. The percentage of time focal dugongs spent feeding and travelling was unaffected by boat presence, the number of boat passes and whether a pass included a stop and restart (pass continuity). The duration, distance and direction of a focal dugong's subsurface behaviour were unaffected by number, continuity or distance of boat passes. However, focal dugongs were less likely to continue feeding if the boat passed within 50 in, than if the boat passed at a greater distance. Mass movements of dugong feeding herds in response to experimental and opportunistically observed boats were timed on 42 occasions but only lasted an average of 122 s. These movements occurred in response to boats passing at a range of speeds, and at distances of less than 50 in to over 500 m. The levels of boat traffic we observed may reduce dugongs' feeding time budget by a maximum of 0.8-6%. Thus at present boats appear unlikely to be having a substantive effect on the energy intake of dugong populations at our study site on the Moreton Banks near Brisbane, Australia. However, boat traffic is likely to increase in this fast growing region, raising concern about the future impact of boats on this and other dugong populations. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

AB Successful recovery and sustainability of threatened and exploited species depends in part on retention and maintenance of genetic diversity. Theory indicates that genetic diversity is lost at a rate inversely proportional to the genetically effective population size (N-e), which is roughly equal to one-half the adult census size (N) in many organisms. However, Ne has been reported to be up to five orders of magnitude lower than N in species with life histories that result in type III survivorship (high fecundity, but heavy mortality in early life stages, e.g. bony fishes), prompting speculation that low values of Ne may be a general feature of such organisms despite sometimes vast abundances. Here, we compared Ne and the ratio N-e/N across three ecologically similar fish species from the arid southwestern United States, all with type III life histories but with differing expectations of egg and larval survivorship that correlate with the degree of human-imposed habitat fragmentation. Our study indicates that type III life history may be necessary, but this alone is insufficient to account for extraordinarily low values of N-e/N. Rather, life history interacts with environmentally imposed mortality to determine the rate and magnitude of change in genetic diversity in these desert fish species.

AB Due to the male's elaborate songs, the Hwamei Garrulax canorus is the most popular caged bird in the global Chinese community. Three allopatric Hwamei subspecies have been described: G. c. canorus in central and southern China and northern Indochina, G. c. owstoni from Hainan and G. c. taewanus from Taiwan. We sequenced the entire mitochondrial cytochrome b gene to reconstruct the molecular intraspecific phylogeny of the Hwamei. Molecular phylogenetic trees indicated that individuals of the three subspecies formed three monophyletic clades with high bootstrap support (> 95%). The basal clade was G. c. taewanus. According to a conventional molecular clock (2% divergence per million years), G. c. taewanus split from the other Hwamei taxa around 1.5 million years ago, and G. c. owstoni diverged from G. c. canorus around 0.6 million years ago. Considering the periodic connection between the Asian mainland and nearby continental islands during the glacial periods, habitat vicariance may have played a more important role than geographical vicariance in facilitating the differentiation of these taxa. Molecular diagnosability, population integrity, and concordance between the population ranges and the topology of the phylogenetic tree suggested that the Hwamei should be delimited into at least two full species: G. canorus and G. taewanus. Our work represents one of the first attempts to re-evaluate the intraspecific systematics for an eastern Asian bird species using molecular data.

AB Lamiophlomis rotata (Lamiaceae), a perennial medicinal herb, is endemic to the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. A total of 188 individuals from eight natural populations of L. rotata in Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (four from Tibet, two from Yunnan, and two from Qinghai) were analyzed using intersimple sequence repeats (ISSR) and randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) techniques. Our results revealed that the level of genetic variation in L. rotata was relatively high (P = 94.85%, I = 0.440 +/- 0.220, H-T = 0.289 +/- 0.028). Three genetic groups corresponding to the three geographic regions were detected, suggesting significant geographic structure. Our results suggest that the highly structured geographic pattern found in L. rotata might represent diverging evolutionary processes associated with the uplifting of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and Quaternary climatic oscillations. These findings imply that as many populations as possible should be preserved in situ for the conservation of this species. Given their genetic variability and peripheral distribution, Qinghai and Yunnan populations should be assigned priority for conservation. Optimal harvesting strategies, domestication and tissue culture of L. rotata should be developed as soon as possible to guarantee its sustainable use.

AB Serial transfer of plastids from one eukaryotic host to another is the key process involved in evolution of secondhand plastids. Such transfers drastically change the environment of the plastids and hence the selection regimes, presumably leading to changes over time in the characteristics of plastid gene evolution and to misleading phylogenetic inferences. About half of the dinoflagellate protists species are photosynthetic and unique in harboring a diversity of plastids acquired from a wide range of eukaryotic algae. They are therefore ideal for studying evolutionary processes of plastids gained through secondary and tertiary endosymbioses. In the light of these processes, we have evaluated the origin of 2 types of dinoflagellate plastids, containing the peridinin or 19'-hexanoyloxyfucoxanthin (19'-HNOF) pigments, by inferring the phylogeny using "covarion" evolutionary models allowing the pattern of among-site rate variation to change over time. Our investigations of genes from secondary and tertiary plastids derived from the rhodophyte plastid lineage clearly reveal "heterotachy" processes characterized as stationary covarion substitution patterns and changes in proportion of variable sites across sequences. Failure to accommodate covarion-like substitution patterns can have strong effects on the plastid tree topology. Importantly, multigene analyses performed with probabilistic methods using among-site rate and covarion models of evolution conflict with proposed single origin of the peridinin- and 19'-HNOF-containin- plastids, suggesting that analysis of secondhand plastids can be hampered by convergence in the evolutionary signature of the plastid DNA sequences. Another type of sequence convergence was detected at protein level involving the psaA gene. Excluding the psaA sequence from a concatenated protein alignment grouped the peridinin plastid with haptophytes, congruent with all DNA trees. Altogether, taking account of complex processes involved in the evolution of dinoflagellate plastid sequences (both at the DNA and amino acid level), we demonstrate the difficulty of excluding independent, tertiary origin for both the peridinin and 19'-HNOF plastids involving engulfment of haptophyte-like algae. In addition, the refined topologies suggest the red algal order, Porphyridales, as the endosymbiont ancestor of the secondary plastids in cryptophytes, haptophytes, and heterokonts.

AB Many of the hypotheses proposed to explain ecotones are based on an individualistic paradigm and are essentially static. While they include local feedbacks, they ignore the interactions between pattern and process across scales. These feedbacks in ecotones are nonlinear in nature and complicate the relations of pattern and process in vegetation, which, combined with observed fractal patterns, suggests a complexity science approach to investigate ecotone dynamics. A cellular automaton of alpine treeline, including nonlinear, local, positive, and negative feedbacks in tree establishment and mortality, as reported in field studies, is used as a model system. Fourier analysis of simulated alpine treelines shows fractal patterns across the treeline landscapes, which are created by patch development. The temporal evolution of the spatial pattern is also fractal. Landscape scale linear correlations between spatial pattern and the rate of advance of trees into tundra arise from localized nonlinear interactions. A tree-patch-landscape scale explanation of pattern-process interaction is proposed in which the endogenous feedbacks determine the spatial and temporal fractal properties of the ecotone. The simulated treeline advance exhibits self-organized complexity and may indicate a potential strategy for monitoring change.

AB Mountain caribou, an ecotype of woodland caribou, are endangered due to the loss and fragmentation of old forests on which they depend. However, a wider array of natural and human factors may limit caribou persistence and isolate populations, and understanding these may help to stop or reverse population declines by forecasting risk and targeting core habitat areas and key linkages for protection, enhancement or restoration. Across most of the historic range of mountain caribou, we conducted a bi-level analysis to evaluate factors related to the persistence of, and landscape occupancy within, remaining subpopulations. We used caribou location data from 235 radio-collared animals across 13 subpopulations to derive a landscape occupancy index, while accounting for inherent sampling biases. We analyzed this index against 33 landscape variables of forest overstory, land cover, terrain, climate, and human influence. At the metapopulation level, the persistence of subpopulations relative to historic range was explained by the extent of wet and very wet climatic conditions, the distribution of both old (> 140 yr) forests, particularly of cedar and hemlock composition, and alpine areas. other important factors were remoteness from human presence, low road density and little motorized access. At the subpopulation level, the relative intensity of caribou landscape occupancy within subpopulation bounds was explained by the distribution of old cedar/hemlock and spruce/subalpine fir forests and the lack of deciduous forests. Other factors impeding population contiguity were icefields, non-forested alpine, hydro reservoirs, extensive road networks, and primary highway routes. Model outputs at both levels were combined to predict the potential for mountain caribou population persistence, isolation, and restoration. We combined this output with the original occupancy index to gauge the potential vulnerability of caribou to extirpation within landscapes known to have recently supported animals. We discuss implications as they pertain to range-wide caribou population connectivity and conservation. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Theory and experiments demonstrate that the number of species in a local area can determine rates of ecosystem processes, but we know little about how the strength of that control compares with other influences or how it might vary across ecological gradients. Here I report results of a pond mesocosm experiment where consumer (snail) species richness, predation intensity, and nutrient availability were crossed in a full-factorial design. This design allowed a direct comparison of the strength of the different factors on food web properties and ecosystem functioning (i.e., system-level fluxes of energy or matter), and an evaluation of how the factors may interact.
   Systems with higher snail species richness had greater secondary production, consumer biomass, ecosystem respiration, and macrophyte stern growth, and lower epiphyton and periphyton biomass. However, snail species richness effects on periphyton and epiphyton were context dependent; predators reduced the effect of increasing snail richness on the biomass of attached algae. Species richness effects were most often the result of a biological mechanism (e.g., differential resource use), rather than being solely artifacts of the experimental design (e g., sampling effects). The effects of nutrient enrichment and predation were mostly predictable from simple food chain models; increases in nutrient availability led to increased algal biomass, primary production, and snail biomass, while predators decreased snail biomass and indirectly augmented algae.
   Snail species richness effects on the biomass of many functional groups were as strong or stronger than those of a substantial nutrient enrichment or of the addition of a voracious predator (Belostoma flumineum). Nutrient enrichment had the most pronounced effects on several system-level processes (e.g., primary production, sedimentation). Species richness had weaker effects on ecosystem properties than on particular functional groups, probably because of compensatory responses among different producer functional groups. In summary, this experiment suggests that the number of consumer species in a system can have large and meaningful effects on the distribution of biomass in a food web, and that these effects can depend on ecological context.

AB The genetic relationships among 337 northern pike (Esox lucius) collected from the coastal zone of the central Baltic region and the Finnish islands of angstrom land were analysed using five microsatellite loci. Spatial structure was delineated using both traditional F-statistics and individually based approaches including spatial autocorrelation analysis. Our results indicate that the observed genotypic distribution is incompatible with that of a single, panmictic population. Isolation by distance appears important for shaping the genetic structure of pike in this region resulting in a largely continuous genetic change over the study area. Spatial autocorrelation analysis (Moran's I) of individual pairwise genotypic data show significant positive genetic correlation among pike collected within geographical distances of less than c. 100-150 km (genetic patch size). We suggest that the genetic patch size may be used as a preliminary basis for identifying management units for pike in the Baltic Sea.

AB Development of general theories and subsequent empirical testing are fundamental ingredients in ecological science. The progress of such efforts is determined by the logical coherence among central concepts, theories, and predictions on one hand, and experimental design, statistical analyses, and interpretation of results on the other. Here, we specifically explore an example of how differences in the way ecological concepts are defined lead to differences in the formulation and statistical testing of hypotheses and ultimately to differences in conclusions about the relative importance of ecological processes.
   In marine intertidal habitats, the notion that wave exposure has an important structuring role is widely agreed upon. Nevertheless, generalizations about its effects and use for accurate prediction of assemblages are often limited. This may partly be explained by the frequent use of categorical rather than quantitative definitions of wave exposure. We compared the conclusions about the importance of wave exposure from (1) analyses of variance based on relative classification of wave exposure and geographic location to those of (2) regression analyses based on continuous measures from 16 locations on the Swedish west coast.
   Variability in richness was substantially better explained by the regression analyses, while for the cover of individual taxa there was no consistent difference between the two analytical approaches in terms of explained variability. The two approaches detected significant spatial patterns for the same taxa, but conclusions about the nature of these patterns were often divergent. Categorical analyses of relative measures of wave exposure and geographic location indicated that interactive effects and differences between geographic areas were predominant. Regression analyses of absolute, continuous measures suggested that mean significant wave height was a better predictor than geographic location and interactive terms. Thus, the choice of definition of wave exposure has important consequences. for how causes of spatial patterns of intertidal assemblages are perceived. Categorical analyses appear to provide clearer indications as to which factors are important while the use of continuous predictors sometimes provides a better fit to the data. The consequences of these findings are discussed in the context of rocky shore ecology as well as in a general perspective of ecological models, hypotheses, experimentation, and analysis.

AB Colonization of two plant species by Glomus intraradices was studied to investigate the two morphological types (Arum and Paris), their symbiotic interfaces and metabolic activities.
   Root pieces and sections were stained to observe the colonization and metabolic activity of all mycorrhizal structures.
   There were no growth responses observed in the plants caused by mycorrhizal symbiosis. The two morphological types had a similar percentage of root colonized, but the Arum-type had higher metabolic activity. Most of the mycorrhizal structures (88%) showed succinate dehydrogenase activity; about half showed acid phosphatase activity; and a small percentage showed alkaline phosphatase activity. Phosphatase activity was highest in arbuscules and low in intercellular hyphae in the Arum-type colonization. In the Paris-type, hyphal coils and arbusculate coils showed a similar intermediate percentage of phosphatase activity.
   We conclude that acid phosphatase is more important than alkaline phosphatase in both colonization types. We discuss the possibility that, whereas arbuscules in Arum-type are the main site for phosphorus release to the host plant, both the hyphal and arbusculate coils may be involved in the Paris-type.

   SELECTION; MALES
AB In agile frogs, Rana dalmatina, an increase in male-biased operational sex ratio and in male abundance results in the emergence of alternative male mating behaviour in the form of searching. As a consequence, females are coerced into mating with multiple males, which in turn increases the level of conflict between the sexes. Selective predation on males by the European polecat, Mustela putorius, decreases the occurrence of polyandry. In ponds visited by polecats, the sex ratio is less male biased than in ponds where polecats are absent. As a result most males call to attract females and fewer males actively search for females. Females are able to choose between calling males and mate with a single male. Thus, predation by polecats is found to influence sex ratio, male abundance and sexual conflict in a frog mating system, restricting the opportunity for multiple mating.

AB Global efforts to conserve species have been strongly influenced by the heterogeneous distribution of species diversity across the Earth. This is manifest in conservation efforts focused on diversity hotspots(1-3). The conservation of genetic diversity within an individual species(4,5) is an important factor in its survival in the face of environmental changes and disease(6,7). Here we show that diversity within species is also distributed unevenly. Using simple genealogical models, we show that genetic distinctiveness has a scale-free power law distribution. This property implies that a disproportionate fraction of the diversity is concentrated in small sub-populations, even when the population is well-mixed. Small groups are of such importance to overall population diversity that even without extrinsic perturbations, there are large fluctuations in diversity owing to extinctions of these small groups. We also show that diversity can be geographically non-uniform potentially including sharp boundaries between distantly related organisms - without extrinsic causes such as barriers to gene flow or past migration events. We obtained these results by studying the fundamental scaling properties of genealogical trees. Our theoretical results agree with field data from global samples of Pseudomonas bacteria. Contrary to previous studies(8), our results imply that diversity loss owing to severe extinction events is high, and focusing conservation efforts on highly distinctive groups can save much of the diversity.

AB This paper compares the development of microsatellite markers from two genomic DNA libraries of avocado cultivar Hass enriched for dinucleotide and trinucleotide repeats. Sequencing showed 86 and 31% of clones from the respective libraries to contain microsatellites. However, banding profiles of trinucleotide loci were easier to interpret than those of dinucleotide loci. Of 376 dinucleotide-containing clones, 81% harbored AG repeats and 19% contained AC repeats. A subset of 104 trinucleotide-containing clones consisted of ATG repeats (44%), AGT repeats (30%), and AAG repeats (16%). Array lengths of up to 34 were attained in the dinucleotide repeat microsatellites, whereas trinucleotide arrays never exceeded 11 elements. Typing 37 genotypes at 25 loci (11 dinucleotide and 14 trinucleotide loci) revealed a total of 204 alleles, of which 60% originated from the dinucleotide loci. Average heterozygosity of the di- and trinucleotide loci was 73.4 and 52.6%, respectively. Many loci, especially dinucleotide loci, exhibited allele size differences that were not multiples of the repeat unit, suggesting nonstepwise mutational mechanisms. Several loci were additionally characterized by large gaps in the allele size distribution. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The distribution of roots of an Erica (Erica scoparia and Erica lusitanica) dominated Mediterranean maquis was studied using three different approaches: root counts on trench walls (down to 120 cm), estimation of the maximum rooting depth using an allometric relationship and estimation of fine root biomass and fine root length using soil cores (down to 100 cm). Roots were classified according to diameter (fine, less than or equal to1.0 mm; small, 1.1-5.0 mm; medium, 5.1-10.0 mm; coarse, >10.0 mm) and species (Erica sp., Pteridium aquilinum, Rubus ulmifolius and Ulex jussiaei). The depth corresponding to 50% of all roots (D-50) was determined by fitting a new model to the cumulative root distribution. Fine roots represented 96% of root counts. Root counts of Erica represented 59%, Ulex 34%, Rubus 6% and Pteridium 1%. Overall root counts showed a D-50 of 26 cm. D-50 was higher for Ulex (40 cm) and Erica (22 cm), than for Pteridium (9 cm) and Rubus (3 cm). D-50 for fine roots was 27 cm, for small roots 11 cm, for medium roots 6 cm and for coarse roots 4 cm. The estimated average maximum rooting depth of the 28 deepest Erica roots was 222 cm. The deepest Erica root was estimated to reach 329 cm. A total of 82% of roots growing deeper than 125 cm were not reaching more than 175 cm. The overall fine root length density ranged from 4.6 cm/cm(3) at 10 cm to 0.8 cm/cm(3) at 80 cm. The overall fine root biomass ranged from 7.7 mg/cm(3) at 10 cm to 0.6 mg/cm(3) at 40 cm. D-50 for root biomass was 12 cm and D-50 for root length was 14 cm. Fine root biomass was estimated as 1.6 kg/m(2) and the respective root length as 18.7 km/m(2).

AB In situ C-13 pulse labelling was used to measure the temporal and spatial carbon flow through an upland grassland. The label was delivered as C-13-CO2 to vegetation in three replicate plots in each of two treatments: control and lime addition. Harvests occurred over a two month period and samples were taken along transects away from the label delivery area. The C-13 concentration of shoot, root, bulk soil, and soil-respired CO2 was measured. There was no difference in the biomass and C-13 concentration of shoot and root material for the control and lime treatments meaning that the amount of C-13-CO2 assimilated by the vegetation and translocated below ground was the same in both treatments. The C-13 concentration of the bulk soil was lower in the lime treatment than in the control and, conversely, the C-13 concentration of the soil-respired CO2 was higher in the lime. Unlike the difference in bulk soil C-13 concentration between treatments, the difference in the C-13 concentration of the soil-respired CO2 was obvious only at the delivery site and primarily within 1 d after labelling. An observed increase in the abundance of mycorrhizal fungi in the lime treatment was a possible cause for this faster carbon throughput. The potential key role of mycorrhizas in the soil carbon cycle is discussed. The importance of a better understanding of soil processes, especially biological ones, in relation to the global carbon cycle and environmental change is highlighted.

AB Root distribution and mycorrhizal associations were compared in primary, secondary and limestone forests in Xishuang-banna, southwest China. Soil cores to a depth of 20 cm were collected at random points from four 50 m(2) quadrats in each forest type. Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) associations were the only form of mycorrhiza found in all forest types. The primary forest was characterized by high root mass, root lengths and AM colonization levels higher than other forest types. In contrast, secondary forests had greater AM fungal spore numbers and specific root length, indicating that plant species in secondary forests achieved a greater degree of soil exploration with less biomass allocation to roots. Root density, AM colonization and AM fungal spore numbers decreased with soil depth in all forest types. Although the correlation between AM colonization levels and spore numbers was insignificant when all forest types were considered together, significant relationships emerged when each forest type was considered individually. AM colonization and spore numbers were correlated with several root variables. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In 1995, an allozyme study was conducted on the genetic structure of a population of the common atyid shrimp, Paratya australiensis, in the Conondale Range, south-eastern Queensland with two subcatchments each within two river drainages sampled. The allozyme study revealed a high degree of population structure, with the data interpreted as reflecting a pattern of restricted contemporary gene flow, primarily between streams within subcatchments. High levels of differentiation occurred between all subcatchments. In this study, we analysed a partial fragment of the mitochondrial COI gene in order to further test and verify these results. The mtDNA data largely conflicted with the hypothesis of restricted gene flow indicating that contemporary dispersal was highly unlikely, even between streams within subcatchments, with many sites fixed for unique mtDNA haplotypes. Additionally, the level of divergence between the Stony Creek subcatchment and all other sampling sites indicated that it had been isolated for approximately 2-3 million years, while low levels of divergence were detected across the Conondale Range between the Kilcoy and Booloumba Creek subcatchments. The sharing of alleles at certain allozyme loci between all subcatchments is, therefore, likely to be the result of ancestral retention and possibly because of the effects of balancing selection.

AB The high biodiversity of tropical marine communities has attracted considerable interest, yet we still lack a clear understanding of the tempo of diversity change in these systems [Jackson (1991) BioScience 41: 475- 482; National Research Council (1995) Understanding Marine Biodiversity, National Academic Press, Washington, DC]. Knowledge of the conditions associated with fast or slow community assembly in the tropics would enhance our ability to predict recovery from natural and anthropogenic disturbance and to conserve biodiversity. Here we report an unusually rapid doubling of species richness within a year in a tropical, subtidal sessile invertebrate community in a protected (non- extractive) zone of the Galapagos Marine Reserve (GMR). Diversity changes in the rock wall community were accompanied by large increases in the percent cover, density and/or biomass of sponges, barnacles, ascidians, and an ahermatypic coral, Tubastrea coccinea, over the 1-year study period (1999-2000). Barnacle (Megabalanus peninsularis) and ascidian (Didemnum cineraceum) biomasses increased by an order of magnitude from 1999 to 2000. The greater abundance of sessile invertebrate prey was accompanied by significant increases in the abundance of barnacle and Tubastrea predators (Hexaplex princeps, Asperiscala billeeana). An estimated 37% of barnacle tissue biomass production was consumed in 1 year. Temperature monitoring during the study period showed that this site is characterized by strong upwelling, where rapid, 3.0-9.08degreesC decreases in temperature occurred at harmonics of the semi-diurnal tidal periodicity during warm (January-February), but not during cool months (June-July). Short-term acoustic current meter measurements revealed strong, highly variable upwelling at the study site, with events ranging from 2-111 min in duration and maximum upwelling velocities of 32.3 cm s(-1). These findings suggest that the turnover of diversity and biomass may be unusually rapid at tropical upwelling sites, especially where invertebrate predators are protected from harvesting. Consequently, upwelling sites may warrant special consideration in the planning of marine reserves to ensure the conservation of biodiversity.

AB Potato cv. Bintje was grown in open-top-chambers and free-air-CO2-enrichment systems at 7 sites across Europe for 2 years (1998-99). The effect of different treatments (CO2 enrichment and O-3 fumigation) on the chlorophyll content of fully expanded upper and lower canopy leaves was investigated collecting Minolta SPAD-502 meter readings. In both CO2 treated and O-3 fumigated plants, leaves had lower chlorophyll content than those in ambient air controls; season-long chlorophyll averages were 9.3% lower in the 'CO2' treatments, 9.1% lower in 'O-3' treatments and 12.3% lower in 'CO2+O-3' treatments. The analysis of chlorophyll content in three different growth phases (Emergence-Tuber Initiation; Tuber Initiation-Maximum Leaf Area; Maximum Leaf Area-Harvest) showed that in the early growth period, i.e. before tuber initiation there was a slight indication for an higher chlorophyll content at elevated CO2 (+ 3.8%) or O-3 (+1.7%). However, from tuber initiation onwards the leaves of plants grown under elevated CO2 or O-3 showed a progressively lower chlorophyll content (-4.8% for CO2 treatments and -2.6% for O-3 treatments) indicating a faster senescence of leaves that increased during the late growth period (-12.8% for CO2 treatments and -12.7% for O-3 treatments) and that was enhanced by CO2-O-3 interaction (-17.8%).

AB We assessed the importance of body size, niche measures, resource availability, life-history traits and population parameters for geographical range sizes of butterflies on a regional (Germany, Baden-Wurttemberg) and European scale. In univariate analyses we found that body size, habitat range, host range, altitudinal distribution, host distribution, the number of generations, dispersal ability and population size were all positively related to range sizes on the two geographic scales. These results were more or less similar in cross-species and phylogenetically controlled analyses. Hierarchical partitioning suggested that habitat range, host range and host distribution influence distributional range size on the regional scale. Body size, clutch size, dispersal ability and population size explained very little additional variance. On the European scale, the importance of altitudinal distribution increased and the importance of host range declined. Our analyses demonstrate that the processes which influence distributional range size of butterflies differ in their importance across scale.

AB In Scandinavia, moose (Alces alces L.) sometimes cause severe browsing damage to economically-import ant pine. Moose-vehicle accidents have spurred construction of fences along roads, and these may interfere with moose migration between summer and winter ranges, or the road alone may be a barrier. If this happens and moose build up along roads, landowners may suffer economically. Therefore, this study investigated whether roads, fences or other factors influence the use of young pine stands by moose. Eighty stands along roads in northern Sweden were evaluated in which individually-browsed branches were counted on 9972 pines. Moose browsing was not significantly related to birch (Betula pendula Roth, B. pubescens Ehrh.) density, nor did it differ between pines (Pinus contort a Douglas or P. sylvestris L.). However, increased pine density, site productivity and proximity to a highway were associated with increased browsing. Further large-scale studies are needed to understand moose habitat select ion and the effects of roads.

AB Gene flow is fundamental to evolutionary processes but knowledge about movements of individuals and their offspring necessary for gene flow is scant. We investigated potential ecological components of genetic connectivity within a population of black rat snakes (Elaphe obsoleta) by radio-tracking 82 individuals. Because adult black rat snakes are highly faithful to their hibernaculum, gene flow between hiberuaculum populations has to occur through mating between members of different hibernacula or through juvenile dispersal. The present study was the first to assess the spatial dispersion of a complete network of hibernacula. The mean distance between the nearest-neighbour hibernacula was 811 m, which was less than the mean distances that reproductive males and females were found from their hibernacula during the mating season. Estimates of maximum distances individuals were from their hibernacula during the mating season indicated that, on average, a female was likely to mate with males that came from two hibernacula away from the female's own hibernaculum. Both males and females appeared to contribute actively to gene flow by moving more and increasing their distance from their hibernacula during the mating season. In addition, on average, females nested closer to a hibernaculum other than the one they attended, thereby potentially increasing the likelihood that their offspring would join hibernacula other than their mothers'. Thus, spatial and movement patterns of male and female black rat snakes are consistent with genetic evidence of extensive out-breeding among local hibernaculum populations.

AB The Galapagos Penguin (Spheniscus mendiculus) is a United States federally listed endangered species with populations on the Galapagos Islands of Fernandina and Isabela. Although the waters around the islands are normally productive, low productivity during El Nino years results in high adult penguin mortality and low recruitment in following years. We used microsatellite markers developed. for Spheniscus penguins to study the long term genetic effects of serial bottleneck events in the Galapagos Penguin, and compared this variation to that of its congener, the Magellanic penguin (Spheniscus magellanicus). The observed heterozygosity for the Galapagos Penguin was 3%, significantly lower than the 46% heterozygosity of the Magellanic Penguin. This low level of heterozygosity is directly related to its low effective population size. While this population has survived long term, presumably without high levels of genetic variation, we feel that the greater frequency of El Nino events, coupled with increased human impacts such as introduced disease, oil discharge, and competition with fisheries, may put the species in particular danger of extinction.

AB Winter barley was grown in a long-term fertilizer experiment (14 years) using two P treatments: (i) no P fertilization over the whole time (-P) and (ii) an annual fertilization of 44 kg P ha(-1) (+P). The objective of the study was to investigate the influence of the P supply on total root production and root mortality (i.e., root turnover) and to assess the benefit of a more rapid root turnover on P acquisition. Shoot development and grain yield was reduced in the '-P' treatment, whereas the standing root system had nearly the same size as in the '+P' treatment. Gross root growth was measured using the 'ingrowth core method'. Mesh bags filled with root-free soil were buried into the rooting zone (0-30 cm) and root growth into the bags over periods of 2-3 weeks was determined. Assuming that no root mortality occured inside the bags during this short period, root length in the bags will be a measure of total root production. Total root production between April and June exceeded the size of the standing root system by a factor of 2 to 3 and was significantly higher at P deficiency. Root mortality as the difference between total root production and the size of the standing root system was also increased at P shortage. P uptake was calculated by using a mechanistic transport and uptake model. Calculations based on gross root growth and root mortality resulted in a higher uptake than calculations based on the development of the standing root system, although the length of the active roots were the same in both calculations. This was due to a better exploitation of undepleted soil areas by the growing root system. The root renewal by a continuous root growth and root mortality is discussed as a mechanism of P uptake efficiency.

AB Two non-papillate species of Phytophthora are the principal cause of pistachio gummosis in Iran, Their previous description as P. megasperma and P. drechsleri was re-examined in the light of RFLP, and sequence comparisons of internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions of rDNA. Both taxa were more closely related to a clade comprising P. sojae, P. cajani, P vignae, P, melonis and P. sinensis than to the unrelated P megasperma s. str, or P. drechsleri. The P. megasperma-like isolates from pistachio differed from all the above taxa in morphology, ITS sequence and AFLP patterns, and are described as a new species, P. pistaciae. The P. drechsleri-like isolates from pistachio had identical ITS sequences to those of P. melonis, P. sinensis and P. drechsleri-like isolates from cucurbits in Iran and the AFLP profiles of P. melonis, P. sinensis and the P, drechsleri-like isolates from pistachio were virtually, identical, This and other published isozyme and mtDNA evidence suggests these taxa should be considered conspecific and all subsumed within P. melonis with a revised host range and geographical distribution, The relationships of P. melonis and P, pistaciae with other members belonging to the same ITS clade are considered.

AB Density-dependent mortality can regulate local populations - effectively minimizing the likelihood of local extinctions and unchecked population growth. It is considered particularly important for many marine reef organisms with demographically open populations that lack potential regulatory mechanisms tied to local reproduction. While density-dependent mortality has been documented frequently for reef fishes, few studies have explored how the strength of density-dependence varies with density, or how density-dependence may be modified by numerical effects (i.e., number-dependent mortality). Both issues can have profound effects on spatial patterns of abundance and the regulation of local populations. I address these issues through empirical studies in Moorea, French Polynesia, of the six bar wrasse (Thalassoma hardwicke), a reef fish that settles to isolated patch reefs. Per capita mortality rates of newly settled wrasse increased as a function of density and were well approximated by the Beverton-Holt function for both naturally formed and experimentally generated juvenile cohorts. Average instantaneous mortality rates were a decelerating function of initial densities, indicating the per capita strength of density-dependence decreased with density. Results of a factorial manipulation of density and group size indicate that per capita mortality rates were simultaneously density- and number-dependent; fish at higher densities and/or in groups had higher probabilities of disappearing from patch reefs compared with fish that were solitary and/or at lower densities, Mortality rates were similar to 30% higher for fish at densities of 0.5 fish/m(2) than at 0.25 fish/m(2). Similarly, mortality rates increased by similar to 45% when group size was increased from 1 to 2 individuals per patch, even when density was kept constant. These observations suggest that the number of interacting individuals, independent of patch size (i.e., density independent effects) can contribute to regulation of local populations. Overall, this work highlights a greater need to consider numerical effects in addition to density effects when exploring sources of population regulation.

AB A New Zealand temperate pasture is currently exposed to either ambient air or air enriched to 475 mu bar CO2 using free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) technology. Sheep graze the site regularly, which results in heterogeneity in nutrient return. To investigate leaf photosynthetic responses, leaf gas exchange characteristics and nitrogen (N) content were measured in two consecutive years in spring under standard conditions on Lolium perenne L. and Trifolium subterraneum L. and on Trifolium repens L. and Paspalum dilatatum Poir. in the second year only. Leaves of the three C-3 species growing under FACE conditions had lower (up to 37% in 1998 and 22% in 1999) photosynthetic rates than leaves growing under ambient conditions, when measured at the same standard conditions of high light and 360-380 mu bar CO2. Differences in photosynthetic rates were correlated with leaf N content and stomatal conductance when measured under these conditions. There was no difference in photosynthetic capacities between ambient or FACE grown P. dilatatum, a C-4 grass. Photosynthetic N use efficiency (A/N) differed among species. For the C-3 species A/N was on average 25% greater under FACE conditions and L. perenne had the highest (240 mu mol CO2 mol N-1 s-1) and T. repens the lowest A/N (142 mu mol CO2 mol N-1 s(-1)) under ambient CO2 partial pressure [p(CO2)]. A/N of L. perenne was similar to that of P. dilatatum measured under ambient p(CO2) but 21% greater under FACE conditions. In the second year, leaf stable carbon isotope compositions (delta C-13) were determined for P. dilatatum, L. perenne and T. repens to assess long-term responses of leaf transpiration efficiency. Using the difference in delta C-13 between ambient and FACE-grown P. dilatatum as a reference to difference in delta C-13 in ambient and FACE air, we concluded that the ratio of leaf intercellular to ambient p(CO2) (C-i/C-a) was similar between FACE and ambient grown L. perenne and T. repens.

AB The cDNA of lungfish Protopterus annectens myelin DM20 was cloned, and the complete amino acid sequence of Protopterusannectens DM20 was deduced. When five possible phylogenetic trees were tested for the DM20 sequences, the maximum likelihood method supported tree 1 [((tetrapods, lungfish), coelacanth), zebrafish, shark] or tree 5 [(tetrapods, lungfish), (coelacanth, zebrafish), shark]. Both tree 1 and tree 5 indicate that lungfish is phylogenetically the closest to tetrapods among the living fishes. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A continent-wide survey of sequence variation in mitochondrial (mt) and nuclear (n) DNA of the endangered great bustard (Otis tarda) was conducted to assess the extent of phylogeographic structure in a morphologically monotypic bird. DNA sequence variation in a combined 809 by segment of the mtDNA genome from 66 individuals from the last six breeding regions showed relatively low levels of intraspecific sequence diversity (pi = 0.32%) but significant differences in the regional distribution of 11 haplotypes (Phi(ST) = 0.49). Despite their exceptional potential for dispersal, a complete and long-term historical separation between the populations from the Iberian Peninsula (Spain) and mainland Europe (Hungary, Slovakia, Germany and Russia) was demonstrated. Divergence between populations based on a 3-bp insertion-deletion polymorphism within the intron region of the nuclear CHD-Z gene was geographically concordant with the primary subdivision identified within the mtDNA sequences. Inferred aspects of phylogeography were used to formulate conservation recommendations for this endangered species.

AB The spatial and temporal patterns of distribution of new settlers of 23 species of damselfish (Pomacentridae) within One Tree Island lagoon, southern Great Barrier Reef (GBR) were measured for 3 summers to assess the persistence of spatial patterns of recruitment. Overall recruitment was 3 times higher in 1993/1994 than 1994/1995, and 1.5 times higher than 1999. In general, recruitment decreased towards the lagoon centre, even though habitat availability was not lower there on average, suggesting that most fish settled at outer sites as they were advected from adjacent waters. There was also great variation in numbers of recruits among outer sites. Patterns of recruitment to continuous reef and patch reef habitats also differed among species, suggesting habitat selection at this broad level. For example, Pomacentrus nagasakiensis was primarily found on patch reefs, while P. moluccensis was largely found on continuous reef. One site (Shark Alley) received the highest number of recruits of most species during the study, and this pattern has been observed in studies since 1975. Despite interannual variability in abundance of potential settlers and differences in the habitat preferences of some species, therefore, some sites on the reef can receive relatively high numbers of settlers over decadal time scales. This consistency of spatial pattern may be due to local topography and oceanography at Shark Alley, which appear to favour the input of potential settlers. The availability of live coral may also be important, but species which showed no preferences for live cover also recruited at high levels at this site. The attributes of Shark Alley were compared with those at other sites. Overall, sites that clustered on the basis of oceanographic and habitat features also had similar recruitment, suggesting that these features may be useful in predicting recruitment hotspots on reefs elsewhere.

AB Molecular genetic techniques have come a long way in the last decade. With the advent of PCR, genetic markers are now accessible for all organisms, including mites. However, there is usually a trade-off between the accuracy of the molecular technique or genetic marker and expediency. In mites, many molecular techniques are not applicable due to their small size. Here we describe a relatively new molecular fingerprinting technique, amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP), which is currently used widely in plant genomic research. We outline the AFLP procedure adapted for mites, show results using this technique from our own research and discuss the benefits and limitations of AFLPs for assessing genetic variation and for genome mapping. It is our intention to highlight the possible use of AFLPs as genetic markers with a broad application in acarological research.

AB The population genetic structure of the Australian plant Lambertia orbifolia was investigated for chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) and rDNA based on restriction fragment length polymorphism. Variation was assessed in 14-20 individuals from six populations with probes covering the majority of the chloroplast genome and the whole rRNA gene unit. For cpDNA, eight mutations were detected which were distributed over five haplotypes. Nucleotide diversity in the species was high and the majority of this diversity was distributed between populations with diversity within populations restricted to a single population. There was significant differentiation between the two regions in the species distribution with the Narrikup region being distinguished by a single haplotype that was characterized by six unique mutations. Variation in rDNA was detected with three gene length variants present in most individuals. However, the Narrikup region was characterized by homogenization of the gene unit to a single length variant in all individuals. The divergence of the Narrikup region suggests that the disjunction in the species distribution has been present for a long time and the two regions represent separate evolutionary lineages.

AB The physiological basis of yield in asparagus (Asparagus offincinalis L.) is poorly understood, but some reports have inferred a link between lateral fern photosynthesis (A) and annual spear yield. Gas exchange measurements were made on single lateral ferns of mature asparagus plants in the field and younger, potted plants. Among three cultivars with different levels of yield, the light-saturated rate of photosynthesis (A(sat)) was positively associated with crop yield in both sets of plants. There was a highly significant correlation between A(sat) and stomatal conductance (gs). A(sat) also increased with fern nitrogen, chlorophyll, and soluble protein concentrations across the cultivars. These data imply that differences in both gs and photosynthetic capacity contributed to the variation in A(sat), and this was supported by A/CI (internal CO2 concentration) analysis. Variation in photosynthetic capacity was related to genotypic differences in cladophyll diameter and thus the content (per unit surface area) of photosynthetic biochemical constituents and, possibly, mesophyll resistance to COL diffusion. The possibility of genotypic variation in other photosynthetic parameters was also noted. It is concluded that fern A(sat), might be a predictor of yield in asparagus, and of potential use in early selection for breeding, but confirmation of such a relationship requires investigation in a wider range of genotypes.

TI The importance of systematic biology in defining units of conservation
SO CONSERVATION BIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB Conservation biology is linked inextricably with systematic biology. The principles of systematic biology, however, have not been integrated completely into the practice and principles of conservation biology. Systematists have recognized for some time that a number of evolutionary processes lend to the diversification of lineages. Yet some present units of conservation, such as the evolutionarily significant unit (Waples 1991), primarily emphasize only one of these processes, adaptation. Allopatric speciation produces biodiversity without requiring any adaptive shift (and consequent adaptive differences between daughter species), so definitions of conservation units that emphasize adaptation may underestimate biodiversity. We estimated the frequency of different modes of speciation for three groups of vertebrates. The frequency of allopatric speciation varies among these groups, but is nn important type of speciation in two of the three groups studied Our results, and the results of other published studies of the frequency of modes of speciation, demonstrate that any unit of conservation defined solely in terms of adaptation is likely to underestimate biological diversity.

AB Given the uncertainties in the fossil record and the paucity of informative morphological characters, there is still considerable uncertainty as to the phylogenetic affinities and times of origins of essentially all of the phyla of animals. A multilocus analysis of amino-acid sequence data for mitochondrial genes suggests that the major triploblast phyla began diverging approximately 630 million years ago. These results support the hypothesis that the so-called Cambrian radiation of animals actually initiated about 100 million years prior to the Cambrian, as the fossil evidence suggests. In addition, phylogenetic analysis supports the monophyly of animals, an early (similar to 900 million years ago) branching off of the cnidarian lineage, the monophyly of deuterostomes and protostomes, and the inclusion of nematodes in the protostome lineage. The results of this study suggest that, with appropriate levels of taxon sampling and a focus on conserved regions of protein-coding sequence, complete mitochondrial genome analysis may be sufficiently powerful to elucidate the genealogical relationships of many of the animal phyla.

AB The effects of supplementary far-red sidelight on the formation of mycorrhizas and on the accumulation and allocation of dry weight and mineral nutrients were studied in Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) seedlings. Starting one week after germination the seedlings were subjected to two different light quality regimes: control and simulated sparse-canopy conditions (FR+). In the FR+ regime, light reflected by neighbouring plants was simulated by means of supplementary far-red light sources, which reduced the horizontal red/far-red photon ratio (R:FR) without affecting PAR. Seedlings were harvested after three months of treatment. FR+ increased stem height and decreased the total dry weight of seedlings. Dry weight allocation to needles was not affected, whereas dry weight allocation to roots was reduced and that to stems was increased in FR+ treated seedlings. The total number of short root tips and developing mycorrhizas per seedling were lower in FR+ than in control plants. Most short roots were developing mycorrhizas, while non-mycorrhizal short roots and mycorrhizas with mantle or external mycelium were very scarce. Changes in the allocation of nutrients in general followed the changes in dry weight allocation, and changes in nutrient content followed those in total dry weight. However, mismatches among these changes resulted in significant changes in nutrient concentrations in some organs: the concentrations of nitrogen and potassium in needles and the concentration of nitrogen in stems were higher in FR+ than in control seedlings. Changes in biomass and nutrient allocation under low R:FR may promote rapid height growth during early development in stands of Scots pine seedlings, but concomitant reductions in growth of the root system and mycorrhizas may negatively affect tree performance over the long term.

AB The densities of newly settled coral trout (Plectropomus leopardus, Pisces, Serranidae) were monitored in a variety of habitats on Green Reef in the Cairns section of the Great Barrier Reef to assess whether spatial patterns of recruitment are influenced by physical features of the substratum, and whether this species uses different habitats during its ontogeny. Surveys showed that small juveniles used sites that were significantly different from random and that these habitat associations changed as the fish grew larger. Specifically, coral trout recruited to level patches of rubble substrata > 5 m(2) and subsequently shifted to high relief features. Densities of recruits were related to the amount of rubble substrata available.

AB This study examined the behavior and reproduction of a monogamous coral-reef fish, Valenciennea strigata, to determine mate fidelity and the proximate causes of monogamy. Most fish were found in monogamous pairs that remained together over several rounds of reproduction. Pairs stayed within close proximity to each other and their burrows. Females fed at a higher rate than their mates, while males spent more time maintaining burrows. Females spawned every 13 days; males guarded eggs in the burrow for 2-3 days. Although females limited the RS of males, males did not mate polygynously under natural conditions. Reproductive success (RS) was affected primarily by survival, and secondarily by size. Both sexes enforced monogamy by guarding their mates. Three factors facilitated mate guarding: (1) all males were able to hold a nest site, (2) both sexes showed strong site fidelity, and (3) residents had an advantage in contests over mates. Thus, mates were economically defensible. Additionally, females formed a crescent of dark pigments on their abdomen that resembled a gravid condition; these marks may enhance continuation of the pair bond. Both sexes preferred large mates, and pairs were positively assorted by size. Males benefited from guarding large females because fecundity increased with size. Females may benefit from the burrowing of males, and larger males should be better burrowers.

AB The role of recruitment in regulating population dynamics of three intertidal barnacle species was investigated by examining sources and scales of variation in recruitment and determining the nature of the relationship between recruitment density and resultant adult population size. The study was conducted in Kachemak Bay, Alaska (USA) from 1991 to 1993 to determine the extent to which recruitment influences population dynamics of species near their geographic limit. Year-to-year variation in recruitment was highly significant, with average maximum recruitment between 1991 and 1993 ranging from 0.85 to 8.71 cm(-2). Recruitment densities on individual test surfaces ranged from 0-71 cm(-2). Inter-site variation in recruitment was significant and the ranking of sites by recruitment density was consistent between years. Recruitment of Semibalanus cariosus (Pallas) in the low intertidal was 7-162 times greater than of S. balanoides (L.) and Balanus glandula Darwin in the upper intertidal. Predation significantly affected the survival of recruits during 1991, a year of comparatively low overall recruitment. Also, 1991 was a year during which there was a linear relationship between initial recruitment and subsequent adult density for all species. In 1992 and 1993, years when initial larval settlement of S. cariosus was much greater, recruits commonly exceeded adult saturation density in the lower intertidal, resulting in intense intra-specific competition for space and leading to decoupling of recruit and adult density. Despite high recruitment in 1992 and 1993, recruit survival to adulthood of all species was actually greatest in the low recruitment year (1991), suggesting that even comparatively low recruitment provides enough new individuals to maintain populations. Consequently, at sites near their geographic limit, recruitment is not the primary process limiting S. cariosus populations in the low intertidal, although its influence was evident for high intertidal S. balanoides and B. glandula populations.

AB The mortality rates of a pomacentrid Acanthochromis polyacanthus were examined in relation to the abundance of large predatory fish (> 200 mm total length, TL) at two spatial scales. Survivorship was negatively related to patterns of predator abundance at a large spatial scale (hundreds of metres) over 3 yr, but not at a small spatial scale (tens of metres) over 2 yr. On the large scale, mortality was consistently greater (14 to 30%) in locations where there were greater numbers of predators, and lower in locations where predators occurred in smaller numbers. Among these locations, spatial differences in rank abundance of surviving juveniles were primarily due to mortality, whereas temporal differences in rank abundance were primarily due to initial juvenile abundance. These data suggest that impacts of large predatory fish were likely to have been greater in space than time and at the large spatial scale than the small spatial scale.

AB Physiological status and root-colonization of Pseudomonas fluorescens 2-79RL were examined in presence or absence of mycorrhizae on the roots of pepper over 6 weeks. Due to incorporation of a ribosomal promoter-driven lux marker into the chromosome of this bacterium, the end of the lag phase and onset of exponential growth is marked by an exponential increase in bioluminescence. In vitro, the duration of the lag phase of bioluminescence after transfer of cells to rich medium increased when the cells had been grown under low nutrient conditions or subjected to prolonged starvation. Lag phase duration thus provided a marker for assessment of changes in the physiological status of P. fluorescens 2-79RL. Pepper plants, non-mycorrhizal or mycorrhizal with Glomus intraradices (GI) or Glomus deserticulum (GD), were grown for 42 days in microcosms containing soil inoculated with P. flurorescens 2-79RL. A blotting technique using filter paper strips was developed to sample cells from the rhizosphere, after which the cells were resuspended for enumeration and determination of lag phase duration. During the first 3 weeks, the population density of P. fluorescens 2-79RL (cfu mm(-2)) decreased by one order of magnitude on the roots and by two orders of magnitude in the bulk soil. The lag phase of bioluminescence remained stable during the first 20 days in the rhizosphere and the bulk soil, but then increased up to day 27 and remained at the higher level until day 38. The length of the lag phase was greater in the bulk soil than in the rhizosphere. Compared with the non-mycorrhizal plants, mycorrhizal infection by GD significantly decreased shoot dry weight and the population of P. fluorescens 2-79RL in the rhizosphere at the root tip and on the older root parts. GD also significantly increased the length of the lag phase of bioluminescence on the older root parts. The effect of GI was less pronounced. The results show this bacterium may be subject to moderate to severe starvation in the rhizosphere and that there are differential effects of specific mycorrhizal fungi on both the population and activity of this root-colonizing pseudomonad.

AB Growth and photosynthesis of Agrostis capillaris L. and Nardus stricta L. were measured for plants grown under ambient and elevated concentrations of CO2 (340 and 550 mu l CO2 l(-1) respectively) and a range of nitrogen concentrations (0.01, 0.1, 1 and 5 mg N l(-1)) supplied as either ammonium sulphate or sodium nitrate. After 42 d of growth for A. capillaris and 49 d of growth for N. stricta, the higher nitrogen concentrations resulted in stimulation of growth. The form of nitrogen did not affect the total dry weight attained by A. capillaris. However, ammonium-grown N. stricta attained a greater total dry weight than did nitrate-grown plants. Nitrogen form influenced leaf area ratio, which was greater in nitrate-grown A. capillaris and in ammonium-grown N. stricta. At the two lowest nitrogen concentrations there was no effect of elevated CO2 on total dry weight in either species, whilst at the two highest nitrogen concentrations positive growth responses to elevated CO2 were observed. Photosynthetic capacity and carboxylation efficiency were lower in plants grown in elevated CO2 at the two lowest nitrogen concentrations, and were associated with greater leaf soluble carbohydrate content and lower foliar nitrogen concentrations. By contrast, the CO2 treatment did not affect these parameters at the two highest nitrogen concentrations employed.

AB Utilization of nutrients at different stages of development was examined for the xylophage, Homalodisca coagulata (Say). Survivorship and consumption rates of second-instar, fourth-instar and adult leafhoppers were measured daily on the hosts Lagerstroemia indica L. and Euonymus japonica Thumb. Rates of consumption, assimilation efficiencies and daily assimilation of nitrogen, carbon, and individual organic compounds were calculated based on chemical analyses of xylem fluid and insect excreta. Gross growth efficiencies of diet utilization were also estimated by comparing biomass of young adults to estimates of nutrient utilization of the two host species. Different instars survived and utilized nutrients at varying rates on the two hosts. Second-instar leafhoppers survived at higher rates and utilized nitrogen more efficiently on E. japonica than on L. indica. However, assimilated nitrogen was much less as a result of lower consumption rates. In contrast, adults on L. indica had increased longevity, utilized carbon more efficiently, and assimilated higher quantities of both carbon and nitrogen than those on E. japonica. Efficiencies of nutrient utilization were high for H. coagulata compared to folivores or phloem feeders, particularly in the conversion of ingested nutrients to assimilated compounds. Variations in diet utilization during development are discussed in terms of polyphagy.

AB Spatial and temporal changes in canopy nutrient content were studied in 1988 and 1989 in a Mediterranean Quercus ilex ssp. ilex L. forest in north-eastern Spain. Sampling was conducted in parallel at two sites which represent endpoints along a slope gradient within a small catchment (ridge top at 975 m and valley bottom at 700 m). Deeper soils resulted in significantly higher N and P concentrations, and N content on a leaf area basis at the valley bottom site. In contrast, K concentration in leaves was significantly higher at the ridge top site, where soil K concentration was also higher. At both sites, N and P content on a leaf area basis was highest at the top of the canopy, where leaf area is highest. N resorption efficiency decreased from top to bottom of the canopy. Results suggested a minor role of shaded leaves as nutrient storage sites. Lower P resorption efficiency was found at the ridge top site. Seasonal changes of P and N concentration on a leaf area basis suggest P replenishment, and to a lesser degree N, during periods of lower growth activity due to low temperatures, but coinciding with higher water availability (autumn-early spring period). Thus, N and P resorption from the remaining foliage in the canopy took place, and to a larger degree at the valley bottom site, coinciding with a slightly higher leaf area index and productivity at this site.

AB Many species of birds demonstrate extreme sexual dimorphism in tail length. Darwin's theory of sexual selection explained the evolution of such elaborate characters, arguing that selection is stronger under polygamy than under monogamy. Alternatively, R. L. Trivers proposed that relative parental investment was the key variable influencing sexual selection. To determine whether tail length dimorphism is associated with mating system and/or relative parental care, we analyzed morphological information for 1,990 species and natural history information for 745 species. Controlling for phylogenetic effects by investigating associations within taxa, we found that tail length dimorphism was significantly associated with both mating system and relative parental care, but particularly with the latter. These results suggest that, when male birds invest less in parental care and/or are polygynous, selection for exaggerated male tail length is more likely to occur.

AB A taxonomically diverse group of angiosperms and certain homopteran insects derive water, inorganic and organic solutes from angiosperm xylem sap. Parasitic angiosperms are connected to their host(s) by a specialized organ (the haustorium) and form close cellular contacts with host xylem tissue, while insects tap xylem vessels by means of stylets. Adaptations to phytophagy are discussed with respect to gaining access to xylem tissue and the nutrition of sap feeders. Parasitic angiosperm-host interactions are examined in relation to recent advances in our understanding of root-to-shoot communication via the xylem (the influence of host-sourced signals on the parasite) and the functional significance of high rates of transpiration in parasitic angiosperms.

AB 1.  Food demands of the predatory carabid Notiophilus biguttatus F. and their fulfilment were studied in the laboratory and field.
   2.  In the laboratory, larval consumption, growth, adult body size and egg production were established for different regimes of temperature and food, the springtail Orchesella cincta.
   3.  Temperature strongly influenced feeding rate of larvae and adults and consequently growth and oviposition rates.  Accordingly, growth rate and oviposition rate increased with prey supply.
   4.  Prey supply also had an effect on fat content, but the number of ripe eggs in the ovaries was related neither to temperature nor to prey supply.
   5.  Adult body size was affected by temperature during the larval period but more so by food supply.
   6.  Dissection of field fresh females showed them to bear eggs for the whole year, except in late winter/early spring and in July.
   7.  Fat content was low in spring and, from July on, high in summer and autumn.  Survivorship during starvation differed widely between samples and seemed to be related to reproductive status rather than to fat content.
   8.  Samples of beetles and springtails from eleven pine plantations revealed for the beetles significant differences in fat content and body size, the latter ranging between the maximum and minimum value obtained in the laboratory.
   9.  Conclusions about food limitation based on body size and fat content were not corroborated by a relationship of these indices with springtail density.

AB The objective of this study was to evaluate management practices which may improve the water use efficiency (WUE) of Spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in an arid Mediterranean-type environment. Multifactorial experiments were performed for ten years at Gilat in the Negev Desert of Israel, where the average annual rainfall was 231 +/- 70 mm, all of which fell during the growing season (December to April), and an average growing-season Class-A pan evaporation of 504 +/- 62 mm. Basic management treatments were: (1) continuous wheat, disk-tillage (CD); (2) continuous wheat, plowing-tillage (CP); (3) wheat after fallow, disking as preparative tillage (FD); and (4) wheat after fallow, plowing as preparative tillage (FP). Three additional continuous wheat disk-tillage treatments were examined for chemical control of soil pathogens and weed-control treatments. The experiment also included four nitrogen-level treatments (0, 5, 10, and 15 g N m-2) and two water regimes, one rainfed and the other fully irrigated.
   In both contrasting water regimes, grain-yield was not significantly influenced by preparative tillage treatments. Profitable grain yields (> 100 g m-2) and profitable response to nitrogen (> 4 g grain per g N added) were obtained with continuous wheat management in only five out of ten years, when the rainfall was above 250 mm. A highly significant increase in yield and WUE for grain production, compared with CD management, was obtained for the same N and water regime, with the wheat-after-fallow management practice (FD). Profitable grain-yield was obtained with wheat-after-fallow management in nine out of ten years. In eight out of the ten years there was no plant-available stored soil water at sowing in FD management, and therefore the significant increase in WUE for the 'dry' fallow treatment could not be ascribed to stored water. Water-use efficiency and productivity were similarly increased in the CD management by a broad-spectrum biocide applied to the soil, suggesting that yield increase after 'dry' fallow is through soil sanitation improvement.
   The significant increase in grain production in wheat after 'dry' fallow management resulted from a marked elevation in the transpiration/evapotranspiration ratio, due to a significant enhancement in root-length density. In rainy years when water supply increased above 250 mm, the advantage of the wheat after 'dry' fallow management disappeared.
   It is concluded that, under arid conditions, improvement of the root density by chemical, cultural or breeding techniques is a feasible strategy for counteracting limited water supply.

AB Potted Eucalyptus globulus Labill. seedlings were grown in sand with added inorganic nutrients. Three treatments were applied: (1) inorganic nitrogen was added regularly (N2), (2) in a small initial quantity only (N1) and (3) after a period of N deficiency (N3); other nutrients were supplied regularly. Biomass increment, foliar nutrient concentrations and gas exchange of leaves were measured.
   Carbon assimilation, N uptake, growth, and leaf production and expansion were all greater at higher N. Partitioning of dry matter to roots and tops of seedlings was unaffected by treatment. Carbon assimilation and diffusive conductance were linearly related at saturating light and were positively associated with foliar N concentrations; intercellular CO2 partial pressures were constant at c. 246-mu-bar. The relationship between carbon assimilation and foliar N concentration was better when calculated per leaf weight than per leaf area. Dark respiration was positively associated with foliar N concentration. Following refertilisation of N-deficient seedlings, foliar N and carbon assimilation increased rapidly; about 20 days later N uptake declined and seedling biomass started to increase.
   Instantaneous transpiration efficiency [c. 5 mmol (CO2) mol-1 (H2O)] was not significantly affected by foliar N concentration or treatment. Instantaneous nitrogen use efficiency of leaves: (rate of carbon assimilation)/(leaf N content) was greater at higher N. In contrast to the literature, there was no simple relationship between nitrogen use efficiency of whole seedlings (biomass gain)/(nitrogen concentration) and seedling N. Instantaneous transpiration and nitrogen use efficiencies were generally high compared with values published for many woody plants.
   A simple model predicted that, with no environmental constraints, exposed mature leaves with high N (1.5 mmol g-1) assimilate 5.4 times more carbon than similar leaves with low N (0.5 mmol g-1). Night respiration of foliage is a greater proportion of daily carbon balance for leaves with low N. When environmental factors constrain carbon assimilation foliage with high N is most affected.

AB Root access to bedrock water storage or groundwater is an important trait allowing plant survival in seasonally dry environments. However, the degree of coordination between water uptake depth, leaf-level water-use efficiency (WUEi) and water potential in drought-prone plant communities is not well understood.
   We conducted a 135-d rainfall exclusion experiment in a subtropical karst ecosystem with thin skeletal soils to evaluate the responses of 11 co-occurring woody species of contrasting life forms and leaf habits to a severe drought during the wet growing season.
   Marked differences in xylem water isotopic composition during drought revealed distinct ecohydrological niche separation among species. The contrasting behaviour of leaf water potential in coexisting species during drought was largely explained by differences in root access to deeper, temporally stable water sources. Smaller-diameter species with shallower water uptake, more negative water potentials and lower WUEi showed extensive drought-induced canopy defoliation and/or mortality. By contrast, larger-diameter species with deeper water uptake, higher leaf-level WUEi and more isohydric behaviour survived drought with only moderate canopy defoliation.
   Severe water limitation imposes strong environmental filtering and/or selective pressures resulting in tight coordination between tree diameter, water uptake depth, iso/anisohydric behaviour, WUEi and drought vulnerability in karst plant communities.

AB The Three Gorges Project (TGP) is a mega-water conservancy and hydropower project that have attracted worldwide attention. Under the influence of human activities, the landscape pattern has changed greatly. Using landscape metrics to analyze landscape pattern changes is the critical to understanding landscape pattern and ecological process. In this study, Landsat TM/ETM+/OLI images are used to extract indices for area edge, shape, spatial distribution, and diversity. Additionally, 19 landscape indices are taken to scale the granularity of the landscape level and the class level. An analysis of appropriate size is used to quantify the response of landscape indices to change landscape patterns during the four stages and a Crosstab model is used for pattern presentation. Finally, landscape indices are analyzed utilizing of Pearson correlation method to identify the landscape indicators suitable for the Three Gorges Reservoir. We have found that both the class level and landscape level indices are sensitive to grain size changes. Our results suggest that the suitable grain size is 30-60 m. Furthermore, the indicators suitable applied to analyzing changes in the landscape patterns in the TGR are Class Area (CA), Number of Patch (NP), Largest Patch Index (LPI), Landscape Shape Index (LSI), Effective Mesh Size (MESH), and Patch Density (PD). The main reasons for the change of landscape pattern in the Three Gorges Reservoir are land consolidation project, returning farmland to forest project, nature reserve construction, hydropower station construction and urbanization development.

AB Urban political ecology (UPE) focuses on unsettling traditional understandings of 'cities' as ontological entities separate from 'nature' and on how the production of settlements is metabolically linked with flows of capital and more-than-human ecological processes. The contribution of this paper is to recalibrate UPE to new urban forms and processes of extended urbanization. This exploration goes against the reduction of what goes on outside of cities to processes that emanate unidirectionally from cities. Acknowledging UPE's rich intellectual history and aiming to enrich rather than split the field, this paper identifies four emerging discourses that go beyond UPE's original formulation.

AB Assembly processes shaping ecological communities can vary over time following variations of environmental conditions at different scales. Such temporal dynamism is exacerbated by climate change and increasing extreme events, and recent evidence suggests that, in turn, community composition and functions can vary substantially. However, empirical relationships between the spatio-temporal dynamics of communities and that extreme events altering ecosystems are poorly investigated. We quantified the temporal dynamics of stream invertebrate communities over two years across 11 river basins prone to drying, covering a large geographical area of France. We tested predictions on the influence of the spatial arrangement and temporal dynamics of drying events across river networks. Combining a high temporal resolution of community description from taxonomic and functional perspectives, we quantified beta diversity over time and space and partitioned them into additive components: replacement of taxa and richness difference. Frequency and duration of drying events were precisely quantified and basins were classified based on the location of the drying events. We found a strong influence of the spatial drying pattern on the dissimilarities of community composition between sites. The high temporal variability of community structure was directly related to the frequency and duration of drying events. This temporal dynamism of communities was also strongly affected by the spatial drying pattern, indicating that fragmentation had a stronger effect on recolonisation processes for upstream-drying basins. Finally, biological traits were unevenly distributed in space and time, suggesting a lack of functional redundancy that could have strong implications for ecosystem functions and services. The high temporal dynamics of communities highlighted in this study challenge the current definition of reference conditions in intermittent rivers, and the community sensitivity to frequency and duration of drying suggest that climate change might lead community dynamics to be increasingly driven by stochastic environmental variability.

AB Functional diversity (FD) has the potential to address many ecological questions, from impacts of global change on biodiversity to ecological restoration. There are several methods estimating the different components of FD. However, most of these methods can only be computed at limited spatial scales and cannot account for intraspecific trait variability (ITV), despite its significant contribution to FD. Trait probability density (TPD) functions (which explicitly account for ITV) reflect the probabilistic nature of niches. By doing so, the TPD approach reconciles existing methods for estimating FD within a unifying framework, allowing FD to be partitioned seamlessly across multiple scales (from individuals to species, and from local to global scales), and accounting for ITV. We present methods to estimate TPD functions at different spatial scales and probabilistic implementations of several FD concepts, including the primary components of FD (functional richness, evenness, and divergence), functional redundancy, functional rarity, and solutions to decompose beta FD into nested and unique components. The TPD framework has the potential to unify and expand analyses of functional ecology across scales, capturing the probabilistic and multidimensional nature of FD. The R package TPD () will allow users to achieve more comparative results across regions and case studies.

AB Anthropogenically driven declines in tropical savannah burnt area(1,2) have recently received attention due to their effect on trends in global burnt area(3,4). Large-scale trends in ecosystems where vegetation has adapted to infrequent fire, especially in cooler and wetter forested areas, are less well understood. Here, small changes in fire regimes can have a substantial impact on local biogeochemistrys(5). To investigate trends in fire across a wide range of ecosystems, we used Bayesian inference(6) to quantify four primary controls on burnt area: fuel continuity, fuel moisture, ignitions and anthropogenic suppression. We found that fuel continuity and moisture are the dominant limiting factors of burnt area globally. Suppression is most important in cropland areas, whereas savannahs and boreal forests are most sensitive to ignitions. We quantify fire regime shifts in areas with more than one, and often counteracting, trends in these controls. Forests are of particular concern, where we show average shifts in controls of 2.3-2.6% of their potential maximum per year, mainly driven by trends in fuel continuity and moisture. This study gives added importance to understanding long-term future changes in the controls on fire and the effect of fire trends on ecosystem function.

AB Aim Species distribution models (SDMs) have played a pivotal role in predicting how species might respond to climate change. To generate reliable and realistic predictions from these models requires the use of climate variables that adequately capture physiological responses of species to climate and therefore provide a proximal link between climate and their distributions. Here, we examine whether the climate variables used in plant SDMs are different from those known to influence directly plant physiology. Location Global. Methods We carry out an extensive, systematic review of the climate variables used to model the distributions of plant species and provide comparison to the climate variables identified as important in the plant physiology literature. We calculate the top 10 SDM and physiology variables at 2.5 degrees spatial resolution for the globe and use principal component analyses and multiple regression to assess similarity between the climatic variation described by both variable sets. Results We find that the most commonly used SDM variables do not reflect the most important physiological variables and differ in two main ways: (a) SDM variables rely on seasonal or annual rainfall as simple proxies of water available to plants and neglect more direct measures such as soil water content; and (b) SDM variables are typically averaged across seasons or years and overlook the importance of climatic events within the critical growth period of plants. We identify notable differences in their spatial gradients globally and show where distal variables may be less reliable proxies for the variables to which species are known to respond. Main conclusions There is a growing need for the development of accessible, fine-resolution global climate surfaces of physiological variables. This would provide a means to improve the reliability of future range predictions from SDMs and support efforts to conserve biodiversity in a changing climate.

AB Macrophages are cells of innate immunity and are derived from circulating monocytes and embryonic yolk sac. They exhibit high plasticity and polarize functionally in response to stimulus triggering it into classically activated Ml macrophages and alternatively activated M2 macrophages. This review summarizes markers of M2 macrophages like transmembrane surface receptors and signaling cascades initiated on their activation; cytokine and chemokine repertoires along with their receptors; and genetic markers and their involvement in immunomodulation. The detailed discussion emphasizes the role of these markers in imparting functional benefits to this subset of macrophages which define their venture in various physiological and pathological conditions.

AB Ecklonia radiata is one of the most widespread kelps globally, dominating temperate reefs throughout much of Australasia and southeastern Africa. Throughout much of its range, it is the only laminarian kelp and hence plays a key role in facilitating biodiversity and driving food webs, and it underpins immense ecological and socioeconomic values. This review synthesises the growing literature on E. radiata from its phylogeny and distribution through to its biology, ecology and recent changes. It provides an assessment of the state of knowledge and identifies gaps in our understanding of this important species. Despite being tolerant of a wide range of abiotic conditions, recent environmental change has caused direct and indirect loss of E. radiata forests, with extensive areas transitioning to turf and urchin barrens. Ongoing climate change may require application of multifaceted and novel strategies to increase its resistance and resilience to future conditions. By integrating variation across space, time and environmental change, this review provides a description of the current status and possible future trajectories of E. radiata forests.

AB Planning urban landscape is essential for maintaining key ecosystem services (ESs) in rapidly urbanizing areas and has become one of the key questions in urban ecology and landscape ecology. In this study, we simulated the urban landscape dynamics in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) urban agglomeration in China during the period of 2013-2040 under different ES conservation scenarios by combining ES conservation priority areas, the Land Use Scenario Dynamics-urban (LUSD-urban) model, and scenario analysis to explore approaches to planning urban landscapes with the goal of maintaining and conserving key ESs. We found that the key ESs could be effectively maintained with urban landscape planning in the BTH urban agglomeration. The loss of food production (FP) under the provisioning service conservation scenario will be 80.88% lower than that under the business-as-usual (BAU) scenario, and the loss of regulating services under the regulating service conservation scenario will be 1.42-10.34% lower than that under the BAU scenario. The loss of recreation service (RS) under the cultural service conservation scenario will be 41.52% lower than that under the BAU scenario. The integrative conservation scenario will be the best scenario to maintain ESs because the losses of FP, carbon storage (CS), water retention (WR), and air purification (AP) will be 29.31-78.49% lower than those under the BAU scenario. Protecting cropland and woodland will be an effective strategy in planning urban landscape to maintain key ESs. When cropland and woodland were protected, ES losses under the integrative conservation scenario will be 85.67-98.58% lower than those under the BAU scenario. Promoting the coordinated development of cities of different sizes will be another effective strategy in planning urban landscape. Under the best scenario of maintaining key ESs, i.e., the integrative conservation scenario, ESs in megacities and large cities can be protected, while ES losses will mainly occur in medium-sized cities. The ES losses in medium-sized cities will account for 60% of the total losses across the entire region. To ensure sustainable development in the BTH urban agglomeration, we suggest that effective policies and regulations be implemented to protect cropland and woodland areas and to promote the coordinated development of cities of different sizes to maintain key ESs.

AB In nearly all large-scale terrestrial ecosystem models, soil respiration is represented as a function of soil temperature. However, the relationship between soil respiration and soil temperature is highly variable across sites and there is often a pronounced hysteresis in the soil respiration-temperature relationship over the course of the growing season. This phenomenon indicates the importance of biophysical factors beyond just temperature in controlling soil respiration. To identify the potential mechanisms of the seasonal soil respiration-temperature hysteresis, we developed a set of numerical models to demonstrate how photosynthesis, soil moisture, and soil temperature, alone and in combination, affect the hysteresis relationship. Then, we used a variant of the model informed by observations of soil respiration, soil temperature, photosynthesis, and soil moisture from multiple mesic and semi-arid ecosystems to quantify the frequency of hysteresis and identify its potential controls. We show that the hysteresis can result from the seasonal cycle of photosynthesis (which supplies carbon to rhizosphere respiration), and soil moisture (which limits heterotrophic respiration when too low or too high). Using field observations of soil respiration, we found evidence of seasonal hysteresis in 9 out of 15 site-years across 8 diverse biomes. Specifically, clockwise hysteresis occurred when photosynthesis preceded seasonal soil temperature and counterclockwise hysteresis occurred when photosynthesis lagged soil temperature. We found that across all sites, much of the respiration-temperature lag was explained by the decoupling of photosynthesis and temperature, highlighting the importance of recently assimilated carbon to soil respiration. An analysis of observations from 129 FLUXNET sites revealed that time lags between gross primary productivity (a proxy for canopy photosynthesis) and soil temperature were common phenomena, which would tend to drive counterclockwise hysteresis at low-latitude sites and clockwise hysteresis at high-latitude sites. Collectively, our results show that incorporating photosynthesis and soil moisture in the standard exponential soil respiration-temperature model (i.e., Q(10) model) improves the explanatory power of models at local scales.

AB Determining the factors associated with the naturalization of alien species is a central theme in ecology. Here, we tested the usefulness of a metric for quantifying Grime's seminal concept of adaptive strategies - competitors, stress-tolerators and ruderals (CSR) - to explain plant naturalizations worldwide. Using a global dataset of 3004 vascular plant species, and accounting for phylogenetic relatedness and species' native biomes, we assessed the associations between calculated C-, S- and R-scores and naturalization success for species exhibiting different life forms. Across different plant life forms, C-scores were positively and S-scores negatively associated with both the probability of naturalization and the number of regions where the species has naturalized. R-scores had positive effects on the probability of naturalization. These effects of the scores were, however, weak to absent for tree species. Our findings demonstrate the utility of CSR-score calculation to broadly represent, and potentially explain, the naturalization success of plant species.

AB The rhizospheric microbiome is clearly affected by plant species and certain of their functional traits. These functional traits allow plants to adapt to their environmental conditions by acquiring or conserving nutrients, thus defining different ecological resource-use plant strategies. In the present study, we investigated whether plants with one of the two nutrient-use strategies (conservative versus exploitative) could influence fungal communities involved in soil organic matter degradation and root exudate assimilation, as well as those colonizing root tissues. We applied a DNA-based, stable-isotope probing (DNA-SIP) approach to four grass species distributed along a gradient of plant nutrient resource strategies, ranging from conservative to exploitative species, and analyzed their associated mycobiota composition using a fungal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and Glomeromycotina 18S rRNA gene metabarcoding approach. Our results demonstrated that fungal taxa associated with exploitative and conservative plants could be separated into two general categories according to their location: generalists, which are broadly distributed among plants from each strategy and represent the core mycobiota of soil organic matter degraders, root exudate consumers in the root-adhering soil, and root colonizers; and specialists, which are locally abundant in one species and more specifically involved in soil organic matter degradation or root exudate assimilation on the root-adhering soil and the root tissues. Interestingly, for arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi analysis, all plant roots were mainly colonized by Glomus species, whereas an increased diversity of Glomeromycotina genera was observed for the exploitative plant species Dactylis glomerata.

AB Aim: We investigated patterns of species richness and community dissimilarity along elevation gradients using globally replicated, standardized surveys of vascular plants. We asked how these patterns of diversity are influenced by anthropogenic pressures (road construction and non-native species).
   Location: Global.
   Time period: 2008-2015.
   Major taxa studied: Vascular plants.
   Methods: Native and non-native vascular plant species were recorded in 943 plots along 25 elevation gradients, in nine mountain regions, on four continents. Sampling took place in plots along and away from roads. We analysed the effects of elevation and distance from road on species richness patterns and community dissimilarity (beta-diversity), and assessed how non-native species modified such elevational diversity patterns.
   Results: Globally, native and total species richness showed a unimodal relationship with elevation that peaked at lower-mid elevations, but these patterns were altered along roads and due to non-native species. Differences in elevational species richness patterns between regions disappeared along roadsides, and non-native species changed the patterns' character in all study regions. Community dissimilarity was reduced along roadsides and through non-native species. We also found a significant elevational decay of beta-diversity, which however was not affected by roads or non-native species.
   Main conclusions: Idiosyncratic native species richness patterns in plots away from roads implicate region-specific mechanisms underlying these patterns. However, along roadsides a clearer elevational signal emerged and species richness mostly peaked at mid-elevations. We conclude that both roads and non-native species lead to a homogenization of species richness patterns and plant communities in mountains.

AB We present the results of a process to attempt to identify 100 questions that, if answered, would make a substantial difference to terrestrial and marine landscape restoration in Europe. Representatives from a wide range of European governmental and non-governmental conservation organisations, universities, independent ecologists and land managers compiled 677 questions relating to all aspects of European landscape restoration for nature and people. The questions were shortlisted by an email vote, followed by a two-day workshop, to produce the final list of 100 questions. Many of the final questions evolved through a process of modification and combination as the workshop progressed. The questions are divided into eight sections: conservation of biodiversity; connectivity, migration and translocations; delivering and evaluating restoration; natural processes; ecosystem services; social and cultural aspects of restoration; policy and governance; and economics. We anticipate that these questions will help identify new directions for researchers and policy-makers and assist funders and programme managers in allocating funds and planning projects, resulting in improved understanding and implementation of landscape-scale ecological restoration in Europe.

AB Root traits play a critical role in plant resource-use strategies and ecosystem functioning, but there is great controversy regarding their identity and functionality in different dimensions of belowground functional variation. Here, we explored the level of covariation among a suite of key root traits (i.e. specific root length, root dry matter content, diameter and density) as well as between them and two aboveground traits related with plant function (leaf nutrient concentration and specific leaf area). We also evaluated whether these patterns of trait covariation were consistent at different spatial scales and organisational levels.
   We collected fine root (< 2 mm) samples of 534 individuals (of 80 woody species) along a wide regional range of environmental conditions in southern Spain.
   In general, strong correlations among most of the root morphological traits were found, supporting the existence of a 'root economics spectrum', as well as between root traits and the aboveground traits. However, root diameter was not completely aligned along this ecological axis, supporting the idea of a multidimensional spectrum of root traits. The main syndrome of root trait covariation was consistent at the different spatial scales and organisational levels. Soil nutrients and water availability were the main drivers of root trait variation.
   Our results indicate that root trait variation is primarily aligned along a leading dimension related to resource economics. However, the distinct pattern of root diameter may indicate a multidimensionality of belowground traits that needs to be explored in greater depth.

AB Increased attention to species movement in response to environmental change highlights the need to consider changes in species distributions and altered biological assemblages. Such changes are well known from paleoecological studies, but have accelerated with ongoing pervasive human influence. In addition to species that move, some species will stay put, leading to an array of novel interactions. Species show a variety of responses that can allow movement or persistence. Conservation and restoration actions have traditionally focused on maintaining or returning species in particular places, but increasingly also include interventions that facilitate movement. Approaches are required that incorporate the fluidity of biotic assemblages into the goals set and interventions deployed.

AB Knowledge of the functional consequences of biodiversity is increasing through studies of both experimental systems and natural systems. Community assembly theory has also helped to reveal the causes of biodiversity organization. However, the causes and consequences of biodiversity have been discussed in parallel and simultaneous consideration of both has been limited, even though they are both influenced by regional environmental conditions. To understand the relationship between biodiversity and productivity, I focused on the linkages between the number of tree species and biomass productivity across forest biomes under a range of bioclimatic conditions. I found that high tree diversity generally increased productivity. This was primarily due to a selection process that results from a high probability of having high-performance species and their dominance at high diversity, regardless of the biome. In less-productive biomes, the residual importance of diversity, which likely reflects other forms of biological interactions (including species complementarity), increased productivity. These findings of differential diversity effects under different environmental conditions are consistent with the existing theory of community assembly, which predicts a shift in the assembly process from stochasticity to determinism with increasing environmental harshness. Analyses based on functional trait diversity also supported this theory: stochastic assembly (resulting in the selection effect) and deterministic assembly (possibly resulting from interspecific niche differences) became more important in productive and less-productive biomes, respectively.Synthesis. Increasing our understanding of the causalities between diversity and other characteristics, such as productivity, is crucial, particularly for forest ecosystems, because of the increasing interest in productivity-related ecosystem services supported by diverse assemblages of trees.

AB Climate warming is altering the diversity of plant communities but it remains unknown which species will be lost or gained under warming, especially considering interactions with other factors such as herbivory and nutrient availability. Here, we experimentally test effects of warming, mammalian herbivory and fertilization on tundra species richness and investigate how plant functional traits affect losses and gains. We show that herbivory reverses the impact of warming on diversity: in the presence of herbivores warming increases species richness through higher species gains and lower losses, while in the absence of herbivores warming causes higher species losses and thus decreases species richness. Herbivores promote gains of short-statured species under warming, while herbivore removal and fertilization increase losses of short-statured and resource-conservative species through light limitation. Our results demonstrate that both rarity and traits forecast species losses and gains, and mammalian herbivores are essential for preventing trait-dependent extinctions and mitigate diversity loss under warming and eutrophication.

AB Context Human and natural systems interact at multiple scales which are context specific in relation to ecosystem service supply. Scenic beauty is recognised as a cultural ecosystem service whose aesthetic value is perceived at a holistic landscape level.
   Objectives In this study we provide methodological advancements for assessing the relationship between landscape visual character and scenic beauty based on crowdsourced geographic information. The final aim is to demonstrate, through a case study application, an empirical method for mapping the scenic beauty of complex mountain landscapes from the perspective of observers which are realistically exposed to the environment being evaluated.
   Methods We propose a viewshed based approach which relies on visual indicators and the location of visitors retrieved by public image storage analysis. A cluster analysis was used to integrate visual characters of the landscape and visiting users' preferences.
   Results Four different typologies of landscapes were finally characterized by distinct values of visual indicators. The spatial distribution of the landscape typologies presented a clustered pattern, allowing a regionalization of the landscape characters. The analysis of the visiting users' provenance revealed that visual scale, naturalness and ephemera attract mainly foreign users, while imageability, complexity and historicity attract mostly domestic and local users.
   Conclusions The combination of crowdsourced images with visual indicators allows a systematic analysis of landscape scenic beauty properties. In all, by understanding how specific landscape characters contributes to aesthetic service provision we provide a tool for facilitating the visualization and interpretation of complex landscape characters.

AB Urbanisation represents a growing threat to natural communities across the globe. Small aquatic habitats such as ponds are especially vulnerable and are often poorly protected by legislation. Many ponds are threatened by development and pollution from the surrounding landscape, yet their biodiversity and conservation value remain poorly described. Here we report the results of a survey of 30 ponds along an urban land-use gradient in the West Midlands, UK. We outline the environmental conditions of these urban ponds to identify which local and landscape scale environmental variables determine the biodiversity and conservation value of the macroinvertebrate assemblages in the ponds. Cluster analysis identified four groups of ponds with contrasting macroinvertebrate assemblages reflecting differences in macrophyte cover, nutrient status, riparian shading, the nature of the pond edge, surrounding land-use and the availability of other wetland habitats. Pond conservation status varied markedly across the sites. The richest macroinvertebrate assemblages with high conservation value were found in ponds with complex macrophyte stands and floating vegetation with low nutrient concentrations and little surrounding urban land. The most impoverished assemblages were found in highly urban ponds with hard-engineered edges, heavy shading and nutrient rich waters. A random forest classification model revealed that local factors usually had primacy over landscape scale factors in determining pond conservation value, and constitute a priority focus for management.

AB Ocean warming is driving species poleward, causing a 'tropicalization' of temperate ecosystems around the world. Increasing abundances of tropical herbivores on temperate reefs could accelerate declines in habitat-forming seaweeds with devastating consequences for these important marine ecosystems. Here we document an expansion of rabbitfish (Siganus fuscescens), a tropical herbivore, on temperate reefs in Western Australia following a marine heatwave and demonstrate their impact on local kelp forests (Ecklonia radiata). Before the heatwave there were no rabbitfish and low rates of kelp herbivory but after the heatwave rabbitfish were common at most reefs and consumption of kelp was high. Herbivory increased 30-fold and kelp abundance decreased by 70% at reefs where rabbitfish had established. In contrast, where rabbitfish were absent, kelp abundance and herbivory did not change. Video-analysis confirmed that rabbitfish were the main consumers of kelp, followed by silver drummers (Kyphosus sydneyanus), a temperate herbivore. These results represent a likely indirect effect of the heatwave beyond its acute impacts, and they provide evidence that range-shifting tropical herbivores can contribute to declines in habitat-forming seaweeds within a few years of their establishment.

AB Trait-based approaches, which focus on the functional characteristics of organisms rather than their taxonomic identity, offer a means to explain how plant communities and ecosystem functions respond to environmental change. Here I review recent developments in the use of plant trait-based approaches for interrogating the functioning of soils and their response to global change. Plant traits impact soil functioning via multiple routes with feedback consequences for biogeochemical cycles and plant community dynamics. They also display a high degree of plasticity in response to global change; as such, there is much potential for global change-induced shifts in trait spectra, both aboveground and belowground, to impact soil functions with feedbacks to biogeochemical cycling across multiple scales. Recent research reveals that root traits play a particularly important role in influencing the soil environment, with strong impacts on a host of physical, chemical and biological soil properties. Although a fast-moving topic, many challenges regarding the use of trait-based approaches to interrogate soil functioning remain. I identify three. First, there is a need for improved understanding of genotypic-and species-level variation in plant traits, especially of root traits that have the strongest potential to influence soil function. Second, there is a need to incorporate new understanding of links between plant traits and soil processes into terrestrial biogeochemical and dynamic vegetation models, in order to enhance their predictive power. Finally, there is a need to harness new understanding of plant traits and their impact on soil functions in sustainable food production systems, in particular to enhance resource acquisition by crop plants. This last point is especially important given the extent that soils are degraded worldwide, and the need to develop sustainable ways of managing soil to prevent further degradation whilst also increasing the production of food.

AB Marine turtles migrate across long distances, exhibit complex life histories, and occupy habitats that are difficult to observe. These factors present substantial challenges to understanding fundamental aspects of their biology or assessing human impacts, many of which are important for the effective conservation of these threatened and endangered species. The early development and application of genetic tools made important contributions to understanding marine turtle population and evolutionary biology, such as providing evidence of regional natal homing by breeding adults, establishing connectivity between rookeries and foraging habitats, and determining phylogeography and broad scale stock structure for most marine turtle species. Recent innovations in molecular technologies, statistical methods, and creative application of genetic tools have significantly built upon this knowledge to address key questions in marine turtle biology and conservation management. Here, we evaluate the latest major advances and potential of marine turtle genetic applications, including improved resolution and large-scale syntheses of population structure, connectivity and phylogeography, estimation of key demographic rates such as age to maturity and operational or breeding sex ratios, insight into reproductive strategies and behavior, and assessment of differential human impacts among populations. We then discuss remaining challenges and emerging capabilities, such as rapid, multiplexed genotyping, and investigation of the genomic underpinnings of adaptive variation afforded by high-throughput sequencing technologies.

AB Wide-ranging, indicator-based assessments of large, complex ecosystems are playing an increasing role in guiding environmental policy and management. An example is the Eli's Marine Strategy Framework Directive, which requires Member States to take measures to reach "good environmental status" (GES) in European marine waters. However, formulation of indicator targets consistent with the Directive's high-level policy goal of sustainable use has proven challenging. We develop a specific, quantitative interpretation of the concepts of GES and sustainable use in terms of indicators and associated targets, by sharply distinguishing between current uses to satisfy current societal needs and preferences, and unknown future uses. We argue that consistent targets to safeguard future uses derive from a requirement that any environmental state indicator should recover within a defined time (e.g. 30 years) to its pressure-free range of variation when all pressures are hypothetically removed. Within these constraints, specific targets for current uses should be set. Routes to implementation of this proposal for indicators of fish-community size structure, population size of selected species, eutrophication, impacts of non-indigenous species, and genetic diversity are discussed. Important policy implications are that (a) indicator target ranges, which may be wider than natural ranges, systematically and rationally derive from our proposal; (b) because relevant state indicators tend to respond slowly, corresponding pressures should also be monitored and assessed; (c) support of current uses and safeguarding of future uses are distinct management goals, they require different types of targets, decision processes, and management philosophies.

AB Little is known about the relative importance of spatial and environmental factors to structuring aquatic and sedimentary microbial biogeography in lakes. Here, we investigated the microbial community composition (MCC) of the water (n = 35) and sediment (n = 35) samples from 16 lakes in western China (salinity: freshwater to salt saturation; pairwise geographical distance: 9-2027 km) using high-throughput sequencing and evaluated the relative importance of spatial and environmental factors to microbial (including total, abundant, and rare) distributions. Our results showed that spatial factors were more important than environmental factors in shaping the biogeography of aquatic and sedimentary microbial communities in the studied lakes, and spatial factors on abundant microbial community was stronger than that on the total/rare microbial communities. Moreover, sedimentary rare MCC might be more sensitive to environmental factors than its aquatic counterpart. Such different biogeography responses of total, abundant, and rare communities to environmental and spatial factors could be ascribed to different physiochemical properties between water and sediment. Collectively, this study expands our understanding of factors shaping microbial biogeography of total, abundant, and rare communities between waters and sediments of lakes.

AB Biotic interactions can have large effects on species distributions yet their role in shaping species ranges is seldom explored due to historical difficulties in incorporating biotic factors into models without a priori knowledge on interspecific interactions. Improved SDMs, which account for biotic factors and do not require a priori knowledge on species interactions, are needed to fully understand species distributions. Here, we model the influence of abiotic and biotic factors on species distribution patterns and explore the robustness of distributions under future climate change. We fit hierarchical spatial models using Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA) for lagomorph species throughout Europe and test the predictive ability of models containing only abiotic factors against models containing abiotic and biotic factors. We account for residual spatial autocorrelation using a conditional autoregressive (CAR) model. Model outputs are used to estimate areas in which abiotic and biotic factors determine species' ranges. INLA models containing both abiotic and biotic factors had substantially better predictive ability than models containing abiotic factors only, for all but one of the four species. In models containing abiotic and biotic factors, both appeared equally important as determinants of lagomorph ranges, but the influences were spatially heterogeneous. Parts of widespread lagomorph ranges highly influenced by biotic factors will be less robust to future changes in climate, whereas parts of more localised species ranges highly influenced by the environment may be less robust to future climate. SDMs that do not explicitly include biotic factors are potentially misleading and omit a very important source of variation. For the field of species distribution modelling to advance, biotic factors must be taken into account in order to improve the reliability of predicting species distribution patterns both presently and under future climate change.

AB Understanding temperature sensitivity of soil organic carbon (SOC) decomposition from bulk soils and aggregates of long-term fertilized plots is imperative to forecast soil C dynamics. We evaluated the impacts of 43 years of fertilization under a soybean (Glycine max) based cropping system on temperature sensitivity of SOC decomposition (Q(10)) in an Alfisol. Treatments were: no mineral fertilizer or manure (control), 100% recommended dose of nitrogen (N), N and phosphorus (NP), N, P and potassium (NPK), NPK+lime at 0.4 Mg ha(-1) (NPK+L), 150% recommended NPK (150% NPK), and NPK+farmyard manure (FYM) at 10 Mg ha(-1) (NPK+FYM). Bulk soils as well as macro- and micro-aggregates were incubated for 24 days at 25 degrees C and 35 degrees C. Cumulative SOC mineralization (C-t) in the 0-15 cm soil layer of bulk soils with NPK+FYM and NPK treated plots were similar but significantly higher than unfertilized control plots. However, both C-t and Q(10) values in the NPK+FYM plots were higher than NPK in the 15-30 cm soil layer. In the 0-15 cm soil layer, NPK + FYM plots had similar to 10 and 26% greater Q(10) values of macro- and microaggregates than NPK. Activation energies required for bulk soils C mineralization was similar to 2 and 3 times higher in NPK+FYM and NPK+L plots, respectively, compared with unfertilized control plots in that layer. Lime along with NPK application increased the activation energy of SOC decomposition. Thus, long-term NPK+FYM and NPK+L applications have great potential for less proportional SOC decomposition than NPK or unfertilized control plots under a temperature rise in these acid soils. However, NPK+FYM management practice is recommended as it has highest SOC accumulation and can have less SOC losses under a temperature rise. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Ancestral sequence reconstruction (ASR) is a still-burgeoning method that has revealed many key mechanisms of molecular evolution. One criticism of the approach is an inability to validate its algorithms within a biological context as opposed to a computer simulation. Here we build an experimental phylogeny using the gene of a single red fluorescent protein to address this criticism. The evolved phylogeny consists of 19 operational taxonomic units (leaves) and 17 ancestral bifurcations (nodes) that display a wide variety of fluorescent phenotypes. The 19 leaves then serve as 'modern' sequences that we subject to ASR analyses using various algorithms and to benchmark against the known ancestral genotypes and ancestral phenotypes. We confirm computer simulations that show all algorithms infer ancient sequences with high accuracy, yet we also reveal wide variation in the phenotypes encoded by incorrectly inferred sequences. Specifically, Bayesian methods incorporating rate variation significantly outperform the maximum parsimony criterion in phenotypic accuracy. Subsampling of extant sequences had minor effect on the inference of ancestral sequences.

AB Establishing trade-offs among traits and the degree to which they covary along environmental gradients has become a key focal point in the effort to develop community ecology into a predictive science. While there is evidence for these relationships across global data sets, they are often too broad in scale and do not consider the particularities of local to regional species pools. This decreases their usefulness for developing predictive models at scales relevant for conservation and management. We tested for trade-offs between traits and relationships with environmental gradients in trees and shrubs sampled across southern African savannas and explored evidence for acquisitive versus conservative resource-use strategies using a phylogenetically explicit approach. We found a distinct trade-off between two major poles of specialization indicative of acquisitive (high leaf nitrogen concentration, leaf phosphorus concentration, leaf N:P, specific leaf area and average leaf area) and conservative resource-use strategies (high leaf carbon to nitrogen ratios (C:N), tensile strength and leaf dry matter content). Although we found that trait variance and species occurrence were constrained by phylogeny, phylogenetically informed analyses did not contradict non-phylogenetic analyses, strengthening relationships in most cases. The high intrasite trait variability and weak relationships with soils and climate may in part be explained by the high levels of deciduousness and disturbance (i.e. fire and herbivory) inherent in African savannas.Synthesis. The relationships between traits and between traits and environmental gradients were far weaker than, and often contradictory to, broad-scale studies that compare these relationships across biomes and growth forms, cautioning against making generalizations about relationships at specific sites based on broad-scale analyses.

AB Colugos are among the most poorly studied mammals despite their centrality to resolving supraordinal primate relationships. Two described species of these gliding mammals are the sole living members of the order Dermoptera, distributed throughout Southeast Asia. We generated a draft genome sequence for a Sunda colugo and a Philippine colugo reference alignment, and used these to identify colugo-specific genetic changes that were enriched in sensory and musculoskeletal-related genes that likely underlie their nocturnal and gliding adaptations. Phylogenomic analysis and catalogs of rare genomic changes overwhelmingly support the contested hypothesis that colugos are the sister group to primates (Primatomorpha), to the exclusion of treeshrews. We captured similar to 140 kb of orthologous sequence data from colugo museum specimens sampled across their range and identified large genetic differences between many geographically isolated populations that may result in a >300% increase in the number of recognized colugo species. Our results identify conservation units to mitigate future losses of this enigmatic mammalian order.

AB Heterotrophic bacteria play a key role in the degradation of organic matter and carbon cycling in river sediments. These bacterial communities are directly influenced by environmental variables that differ spatially and temporally in rivers. Here, we studied the longitudinal patterns of sediment bacterial community composition and dissolved organic matter utilization under base flow and drought conditions in a Mediterranean river. Our results indicated that sediment microbial communities were affected by dissolved organic matter quality and origin along the river continuum. In headwaters the potential degradation of cellulose and hemicellulose was greater (i.e., higher beta-glucosidase and beta-xylosidase activities), suggesting higher microbial utilization of allochthonous detritus from terrestrial origin. Conversely, the accumulation and transport of more recalcitrant compounds (i.e., decrease in the recalcitrant index) became potentially relevant downstream. Furthermore, discharge fluctuations had clear effects on bacterial community composition and dissolved organic matter use. The hydrological fragmentation of the river continuum during drought period generated sediment microhabitats dominated by gamma and delta-Proteobacteria, with a greater potential capacity to degrade a wide range of compounds, particularly nitrogen containing moieties. During base flow conditions, we observed a higher occurrence of alpha-Proteobacteria and a greater potential use of more recalcitrant carbon compounds, mostly of terrestrial origin. Overall, our findings suggest an upstream-downstream longitudinal transition of sediment microbial communities that rely on allochthonous to autochthonous dissolved organic matter, and a shift toward autochthonous dissolved organic matter reliance during drought.

AB "Ecosystem services" is a phrase with many meanings, yet very few studies have primarily focused on comparing different definitions of the term. Ecosystem services are now generally used in identifying an appropriately wide range of environmental variables for policy and management as well as better understanding the benefits provided by those aspects of the environment. A review of the dominant definitions of ecosystem services reveals the term is comprehensive in its scope and requires further specification for most purposes. Analysis further reveals that there are four main categories of conceptual definitions. The paper concludes that ecosystem services can be identified at various points along the spectrum of nature-human interaction depending on which specific definition is chosen and that the term was not created to identify a novel set of environmental objects or processes.

AB Habitat loss is a key driver in the decline of terrestrial and marine species worldwide. In the marine environment, habitat loss is considered to be a major threat to seahorses Hippocampus spp. This study assessed changes in the population abundance of White's seahorse Hippocampus whitei from mark-resight surveys undertaken between 2006 and 2015 in Port Stephens (New South Wales, Australia). The mark-resight closed population estimates found that the population at the Seahorse Gardens site had declined by 97% between 2009 and 2015, and similarly, the population at the Pipeline site was found to decrease by 83% over the same time period. Comparison of habitat composition data found a significant decline in available marine habitats between 2009 and 2015 at both sites. SIMPER analysis indicated that 5 habitat types (soft coral Dendronephthya australis, sand, seagrass Halophila ovalis, sponges and algae) contributed 76% of the dissimilarity between the sampling periods. The preferred habitats of H. whitei had significantly declined at both sites, with D. australis declining at the Seahorse Gardens site by similar to 96% from 2009 to 2015 and by similar to 73% at the Pipeline site, whilst sponge habitat was also found to decline by similar to 49% at the Seahorse Gardens site and similar to 25% at the Pipeline site. The significant decline of H. whitei abundance is concerning, as there is no evidence to suggest that the populations are recovering, and given the large decline of habitat availability at both sites, it would be difficult for seahorses to recolonise these areas without some form of habitat remediation.

AB Research on the dynamics of biodiversity has progressed tremendously over recent years, although in two separate directions - ecological, to determine change over space at a given time, and evolutionary, to understand change over time. Integration of these approaches has remained elusive. Archipelagoes with a known geological chronology provide an opportunity to study ecological interactions over evolutionary time. Here, I focus on the Hawaiian archipelago and summarize the development of ecological and evolutionary research; I emphasize spiders because they have attributes allowing analysis of ecological affinities in concert with diversification. Within this framework, I highlight recent insights from the island chronosequence, in particular the importance of (i) selection and genetic drift in generating diversity; (ii) fusion and fission in fostering diversification; and (iii) variability upon which selection can act. Insights into biodiversity dynamics at the nexus of ecology and evolution are now achievable by integrating new tools, in particular (i) ecological metrics (interaction networks, maximum entropy inference) across the chronosequence to uncover community dynamics and (ii) genomic tools to understand contemporaneous microevolutionary change. The work can inform applications of invasion and restoration ecology by elucidating the importance of changes in abundances, interaction strengths, and rates of evolutionary response in shaping biodiversity.

AB 1. Traits are powerful predictors of ecosystem functions pointing to underlying physiological and ecological processes. Plant individual performance results from the coordinated operation of many processes, ranging from nutrient uptake over organ turnover to photosynthesis, thus requiring a large set of traits for its prediction. For plant performance on higher hierarchical levels, e.g. populations, additional traits important for plant-plant and trophic interactions may be required which should even enlarge the spectrum of relevant predictor traits.
   2. The goal of this study was to assess the importance of plant functional traits to predict individual and population performance of grassland species with particular focus on the significance of root traits. We tested this for 59 grassland species using 35 traits divided into three trait clusters: leaf traits (16), stature traits (8) and root traits (11), using individual biomass of mesocosm plants as a measure of individual performance and population biomass of monocultures as a measure of population performance. We applied structural equation models to disentangle direct effects of single traits on population biomass and indirect effects via individual plant biomass or shoot density. We tested multivariate trait effects on individual and population biomass to analyse whether the importance of different trait clusters shifts with increasing hierarchical integration from individuals to populations.
   3. Traits of all three clusters significantly correlated with individual and population biomass. However, in spite of a number of significant correlations, above-below-ground linkages were generally weak, with few exceptions like N content.
   4. Stature traits exclusively affected population biomass indirectly via their effect on individual biomass, whereas root and leaf traits showed also direct effects and partly indirect effects via density.
   5. The inclusion of root traits in multiple regression models improved the prediction of individual biomass when compared with models with only above-ground information only slightly (95% vs. 93% of variance prediction with and without root traits, respectively) but was crucial for the prediction of population biomass (77% and 49%, respectively). Root traits were more important for plant performance than leaf traits and were even the most important predictors at the population level
   6. Synthesis. Upscaling from the individual to the population level reflects an increasing number of processes requiring traits from different trait clusters for their prediction. Our results emphasize the importance of root traits for trait-based studies especially at higher organizational levels. Our approach provides a comprehensive framework acknowledging the hierarchical nature of trait influences. This is one step towards a more process-oriented assessment of trait-based approaches.

AB Tasmanian blue gum (Eucalyptus globulus) has been increasingly used in forestry outside its native range, and is nowadays one of the most important pulpwood species in the world. E. globulus has great economic importance in many countries, and in Portugal it has recently become the most widespread tree species. However, there is also an increasing concern about the potential ability of eucalypts to naturally establish from seed (wildling establishment), because of negative ecological and economic impacts this could cause. The natural establishment of this fast-growing exotic species may have undesirable consequences, but little is known about its distribution, or which are the factors influencing its occurrence. In order to investigate these issues, we characterized wildling occurrence and abundance along 3111 roadside transects adjacent to eucalypt plantations distributed throughout continental Portugal. Eucalypt wildlings were found in 60 % of the sampled transects and across all natural regions, with densities ranging from 0 to 10,000 plants ha(-1) (mean = 277 plants ha(-1)). The potential influence of environmental variables on wildling establishment from plantations was assessed using boosted regression trees. The abundance of wildlings was found to be primarily affected by precipitation and distance from the sea (used as a surrogate of thermal amplitude), although topography, frost occurrence and soil type also played a significant role. Plant density peaked at around 1500 mm of annual precipitation and it decreased with both decreasing and increasing precipitation, reaching the lowest values below 800 mm and above 2400 mm. Eucalypt wildlings were also more abundant in areas with milder temperatures, namely closer to the sea (with lower thermal amplitude) and with lower number of frost days. Finally, plant density also seemed to be favoured in areas with intermediate elevation, higher slope and with certain soil types (namely Cambisols and Podzols). Knowing the regions with higher wildling density and understanding the factors influencing plant establishment may help managers to establish and prioritize eventual control plans in regions with higher probability of recruitment.

AB Analysis of an invasive species' niche shift between native and introduced ranges, along with potential distribution maps, can provide valuable information about its invasive potential. The tawny crazy ant, Nylanderia fulva, is a rapidly emerging and economically important invasive species in the southern United States. It is originally from east-central South America and has also invaded Colombia and the Caribbean Islands. Our objectives were to generate a global potential distribution map for N.fulva, identify important climatic drivers associated with its current distribution, and test whether N.fulva's realized climatic niche has shifted across its invasive range. We used MaxEnt niche model to map the potential distribution of N.fulva using its native and invaded range occurrences and climatic variables. We used principal component analysis methods for investigating potential shifts in the realized climatic niche of N.fulva during invasion. We found strong evidence for a shift in the realized climatic niche of N.fulva across its invasive range. Our models predicted potentially suitable habitat for N.fulva in the United States and other parts of the world. Our analyses suggest that the majority of observed occurrences of N.fulva in the United States represent stabilizing populations. Mean diurnal range in temperature, degree days at 10 degrees C, and precipitation of driest quarter were the most important variables associated with N.fulva distribution. The climatic niche expansion demonstrated in our study may suggest significant plasticity in the ability of N.fulva to survive in areas with diverse temperature ranges shown by its tolerance for environmental conditions in the southern United States, Caribbean Islands, and Colombia. The risk maps produced in this study can be useful in preventing N.fulva's future spread, and in managing and monitoring currently infested areas.

TI Understanding the Spatio-Temporal Response of Coral Reef Fish

AB Understanding how communities respond to natural disturbances is fundamental to assess the mechanisms of ecosystem resistance and resilience. However, ecosystem responses to natural disturbances are rarely monitored both through space and time, while the factors promoting ecosystem stability act at various temporal and spatial scales. Hence, assessing both the spatial and temporal variations in species composition is important to comprehensively explore the effects of natural disturbances. Here, we suggest a framework to better scrutinize the mechanisms underlying community responses to disturbances through both time and space. Our analytical approach is based on beta diversity decomposition into two components, replacement and biomass difference. We illustrate this approach using a 9-year monitoring of coral reef fish communities off Moorea Island (French Polynesia), which encompassed two severe natural disturbances: a crown-of-thorns starfish outbreak and a hurricane. These disturbances triggered a fast logistic decline in coral cover, which suffered a 90% decrease on all reefs. However, we found that the coral reef fish composition remained largely stable through time and space whereas compensatory changes in biomass among species were responsible for most of the temporal fluctuations, as outlined by the overall high contribution of the replacement component to total beta diversity. This suggests that, despite the severity of the two disturbances, fish communities exhibited high resistance and the ability to reorganize their compositions to maintain the same level of total community biomass as before the disturbances. We further investigated the spatial congruence of this pattern and showed that temporal dynamics involved different species across sites; yet, herbivores controlling the proliferation of algae that compete with coral communities were consistently favored. These results suggest that compensatory changes in biomass among species and spatial heterogeneity in species responses can provide further insurance against natural disturbances in coral reef ecosystems by promoting high levels of key species (herbivores). They can also allow the ecosystem to recover more quickly.

AB Nitrification plays a central role in global nitrogen cycle, which is affected by biological interaction between soil microfauna and microorganisms. However, the complexity of soil biotic communities made it difficult to reveal organizational principles of the community and the interactions among species. Here, we used the network analysis to decipher the interactions between nematodes and ammonia oxidizers within aggregate fractions under 10-year manure application, and examine their associations with soil variables and potential nitrification activity (PNA). Three aggregate fractions included large macroaggregates (>2000 mu m, LA), small macroaggregates (250-2000 mu m, SA), and inter-aggregate soil and space (<250 mu m, IA). Aggregate factions showed a remarkable effect on association networks of nematodes and ammonia oxidizers. The average connectivity (avgK) and the number of edges in overall networks increased with increasing aggregate sizes, while the average geodesic distance (GD) followed the opposite trend. The LA network could be viewed as a better organized or a better operational soil food web with more functional interrelated members than the SA and IA networks. The modules related to PNA were significantly correlated and clustered together as meta-modules in networks of aggregate fractions. The role-shifts prevailed among the network members such as significant module memberships (MMs) and generalist/specialist operational taxonomic units (OTUs). A half of shared nodes were further identified as shared MMs, dominated by ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) especially for Nitrosospira cluster 3a and 10. Soil pH could explain partly the shift of module hubs in different networks, while grazing by bacterivores might account for three exclusively connecters related to Nitrososphaera clusters 1.1. The strongly coupled modules correlated positively to pH and total carbon (TC), regardless of aggregate fractions. The network analysis approach provided new insights into potential importance of network interactions between nematodes and ammonia oxidizers in soil nitrogen cycling. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In Brazil, the introduction of non-native fish is commonplace, and the only existing measure to address this problem is the normative approach (i.e., laws and inspections). However, this approach has failed to control or prevent introductions because enforcing laws in a country the size of a continent, where inspections and monitoring are minimal or non-existent, is difficult. In addition, society is generally unaware of this issue. More effective actions or complementary preventive measures are urgently needed, and the most promising approach is to change human behavior via educational opportunities. In this short essay, we propose that exposing society to high quality information is a powerful alternative because well-informed people naturally make more rational and balanced decisions. For example, informed stake-holders may be more cautious when handling non-native species, may adopt appropriate management practices and may cease deliberate releases. Moreover, a well-informed society will naturally avoid or prevent harmful activities that may lead to the introduction of alien species. From this perspective, this short essay explores opportunities to implement educational practices for containing new introductions. First, we present the primary activities that are responsible for the introduction of non-native fish in Brazil (i.e., aquaculture, fishkeeping and sport fishing) and then suggest simple educational pathways that are specific to each activity. In addition, we advocate for the inclusion of invasion biology in formal education to educate society as a whole. If the topic receives the necessary attention in the educational curriculum, then education will play a central role in creating new behavioral standards, awareness and responsibility at different societal levels, with the primary goal of reducing the rate of new fish introductions.

AB The ecological niche is the set of environments in which a population of a species can persist without introduction of individuals from other locations. A good mathematical or computational representation of the niche is a prerequisite to addressing many questions in ecology, biogeography, evolutionary biology and conservation. A particularly challenging question for ecological niche modelling is the problem of presence-only modelling. That is, can an ecological niche be identified from records drawn only from the set of niche environments without records from non-niche environments for comparison? Here, I introduce a new method for ecological niche modelling from presence-only data called range bagging. Range bagging draws on the concept of a species' environmental range, but was inspired by the empirical performance of ensemble learning algorithms in other areas of ecological research. This paper extends the concept of environmental range to multiple dimensions and shows that range bagging is computationally feasible even when the number of environmental dimensions is large. The target of the range bagging base learner is an environmental tolerance of the species in a projection of its niche and is therefore an ecologically interpretable property of a species' biological requirements. The computational complexity of range bagging is linear in the number of examples, which compares favourably with the main alternative, Qhull. In conclusion, range bagging appears to be a reasonable choice for niche modelling in applications in which a presence-only method is desired and may provide a solution to problems in other disciplines where one-class classification is required, such as outlier detection and concept learning.

AB Four different modelling techniques were compared and evaluated: generalized linear models (GLM), generalized additive models (GAM), classification and regression trees (CART) and boosted regression trees (BRT). Each method was used to model fish species richness variation throughout several Portuguese estuarine systems. Model comparisons were based on goodness-of-fit and predictive performance via cross-validation. The relative influence of the most important predictors according to each of the four models was also examined. Fitted BRT, CART, GAM and GLM models accounted for 70.6%, 57.0%, 34.6% and 23.7% of total model deviance, respectively. No single variable was consistently responsible for the larger amount of percentage of relative deviance explained by the models, but several variables were selected by the four models. Nevertheless, their relative importance was highly variable, according to each modelling technique. The tree-based models (CART and BRT) presented lower prediction errors after cross-validation. The limitations and usefulness of each technique are discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In many physical geography settings, principal component analysis (PCA) is applied without consideration for important spatial effects, and in doing so, tends to provide an incomplete understanding of a given process. In such circumstances, a spatial adaptation of PCA can be adopted, and to this end, this study focuses on the use of geographically weighted principal component analysis (GWPCA). GWPCA is a localized version of PCA that is an appropriate exploratory tool when a need exists to investigate for a certain spatial heterogeneity in the structure of a multivariate data set. This study provides enhancements to GWPCA with respect to: (i) finding the scale at which each localized PCA should operate; and (ii) visualizing the copious amounts of output that result from its application. An extension of GWPCA is also proposed, where it is used to detect multivariate spatial outliers. These advancements in GWPCA are demonstrated using an environmental freshwater chemistry data set, where a commentary on the use of preprocessed (transformed and standardized) data is also presented. The study is structured as follows: (1) the GWPCA methodology; (2) a description of the case study data; (3) the GWPCA application, demonstrating the value of the proposed advancements; and (4) conclusions. Most GWPCA functions have been incorporated within the GWmodel R package.

Accordingly, assessment of distributional patterns across a suite of potentially connected communities (i.e. metacommunity structure) is an appropriate approach for understanding the effects of landscape modification and complements the plethora of fragmentation studies that have focused on local community structure. To date, metacommunity structure within human-modified landscapes has been assessed with regard to nestedness along species richness gradients. This is problematic because there is little support that species richness gradients are associated with the factors moulding species distributions. More importantly, many alternative patterns are possible, and different patterns may manifest during different seasons and for different guilds because of variation in resource availability and resource requirements of taxa. We determined the best-fit metacommunity structure of a phyllostomid bat assemblage, frugivore ensemble, and gleaning animalivore ensemble within a human-modified landscape in the Caribbean lowlands of Costa Rica during the dry and wet seasons to elucidate important structuring mechanisms. Furthermore, we identified the landscape characteristics associated with the latent gradient underlying metacommunity structure. We discriminated among multiple metacommunity structures by assessing coherence, range turnover, and boundary clumping of an ordinated site-by-species matrix. We identified the landscape characteristics associated with the latent gradient underlying metacommunity structure via hierarchical partitioning. Metacommunity structure was never nested nor structured along a richness gradient. The phyllostomid assemblage and frugivore ensemble exhibited Gleasonian structure (range turnover along a common gradient) during the dry season and Clementsian structure (range turnover and shared boundaries along a common gradient) during the wet season. Distance between forest patches and forest edge density structured the phyllostomid metacommunity during the dry and wet seasons, respectively. Proportion of pasture and forest patch density structured the frugivore metacommunity during the dry season. Gleaning animalivores exhibited chequerboard structure (mutually exclusive species pairs) during the dry season and random structure during the wet season. Metacommunity structure was likely mediated by differential resource use or interspecific relationships. Furthermore, the interaction between landscape characteristics and seasonal variation in resources resulted in season-specific and guild-specific distributional patterns.

AB Patterns of diversity and community composition in forests are controlled by a combination of environmental factors, historical events, and stochastic or neutral mechanisms. Each of these processes has been linked to forest community assembly, but their combined contributions to alpha and beta-diversity in forests has not been well explored. Here we use variance partitioning to analyze 40000 individual trees of 49 species, collected within 137 ha of sampling area spread across a 900-ha temperate deciduous forest reserve in Pennsylvania to ask (1) To what extent is site-to-site variation in species richness and community composition of a temperate forest explained by measured environmental gradients and by spatial descriptors (used here to estimate dispersal-assembly or unmeasured, spatially structured processes)? (2) How does the incorporation of land-use history information increase the importance attributed to deterministic community assembly? and (3) How do the distributions and abundances of individual species within the community correlate with these factors? Environmental variables (i.e., topography, soils, and distance to stream), spatial descriptors (i.e., spatial eigenvectors derived from Cartesian coordinates), and land-use history variables (i.e., land-use type and intensity, forest age, and distance to road), explained about half of the variation in both species richness and community composition. Spatial descriptors explained the most variation, followed by measured environmental variables and then by land-use history. Individual species revealed variable responses to each of these sets of predictor variables. Several species were associated with stream habitats, and others were strictly delimited across opposing north- and south-facing slopes. Several species were also associated with areas that experienced recent (i.e., <100 years) human land-use impacts. These results indicate that deterministic factors, including environmental and land-use history variables, are important drivers of community response. The large amount of unexplained variation seen here (about 50%) is commonly observed in other such studies attempting to explain distribution and abundance patterns of plant communities. Determining whether such large fractions of unaccounted for variation are caused by a lack of sufficient data, or are an indication of stochastic features of forest communities globally, will remain an important challenge for ecologists in the future.

AB Species distribution modeling (SDM) is a methodology that has been widely used in the past two decades for developing quantitative, empirical, predictive models of species environment relationships. SDM methods could be more broadly applied than they currently are to address research questions in archaeology and paleoanthropology. Specifically, SDM can be used to hindcast paleodistributions of species and ecological communities (paleo-SDM) for time periods and locations of prehistoric human occupation. Paleo-SDM may be a powerful tool for understanding human prehistory if used to hindcast the distributions of plants, animals and ecological communities that were key resources for prehistoric humans and to use this information to reconstruct the resource landscapes (paleoscapes) of prehistoric people. Components of the resource paleoscape include species (game animals, food plants), habitats, and geologic features and landforms associated with stone materials for tools, pigments, and so forth. We first review recent advances in SDM as it has been used to hindcast paleodistributions of plants and animals in the field of paleobiology. We then compare the paleo-SDM approach to paleoenvironmental reconstructions modeled from zooarchaeological and archaeobotanical records, widely used in archaeology and paleoanthropology. Next, we describe the less well developed but promising approach of using paleo-SDM methods to reconstruct resource paleoscapes. We argue that paleo-SDM offers an explicitly deductive strategy that generates spatial predictions grounded in strong theoretical understandings of the relation between species, habitat distributions and environment. Because of their limited sampling of space and time, archaeobiological records may be better suited for paleo-SDM validation than directly for paleoenvironmental reconstruction. We conclude by discussing the data requirements, limitations and potential for using predictive modeling to reconstruct resource paleoscapes. There is a need for improved paleoclimate models, improved paleoclimate proxy and species paleodistribution data for model validation, attention to scale issues, and rigorous modeling methods including mechanistic models.

AB Desaturase genes are essential for biological processes, including lipid metabolism, cell signaling, and membrane fluidity regulation. Insect desaturases are particularly interesting for their role in chemical communication, and potential contribution to speciation, symbioses, and sociality. Here, we describe the acyl-CoA desaturase gene families of 15 insects, with a focus on social Hymenoptera. Phylogenetic reconstruction revealed that the insect desaturases represent an ancient gene family characterized by eight subfamilies that differ strongly in their degree of conservation and frequency of gene gain and loss. Analyses of genomic organization showed that five of these subfamilies are represented in a highly microsyntenic region conserved across holometabolous insect taxa, indicating an ancestral expansion during early insect evolution. In three subfamilies, ants exhibit particularly large expansions of genes. Despite these expansions, however, selection analyses showed that desaturase genes in all insect lineages are predominantly undergoing strong purifying selection. Finally, for three expanded subfamilies, we show that ants exhibit variation in gene expression between species, and more importantly, between sexes and castes within species. This suggests functional differentiation of these genes and a role in the regulation of reproductive division of labor in ants. The dynamic pattern of gene gain and loss of acyl-CoA desaturases in ants may reflect changes in response to ecological diversification and an increased demand for chemical signal variability. This may provide an example of how gene family expansions can contribute to lineage-specific adaptations through structural and regulatory changes acting in concert to produce new adaptive phenotypes.

AB Urbanization profoundly impacts animal populations by causing isolation, increased susceptibility to disease, and exposure to toxicants. Genetic effects include reduced effective population size, increased population substructure, and decreased adaptive potential. We investigated the influence that urbanization and a disease epizootic had on the population genetics of bobcats (Lynx rufus) distributed across a highly fragmented urban landscape. We genotyped more than 300 bobcats, sampled from 1996 to 2012, for variation at nine neutral and seven immune gene-linked microsatellite loci. We found that two freeways are significant barriers to gene flow. Further, a 3-year disease epizootic, associated with secondary anticoagulant rodenticide exposure, caused a population bottleneck that led to significant genetic differentiation between pre- and post-disease populations that was greater than that between populations separated by major freeways for >60years. However, balancing selection acted on immune-linked loci during the epizootic, maintaining variation at functional regions. Conservation assessments need to assay loci that are potentially under selection to better preserve the adaptive potential of populations at the urban-wildland interface. Further, interconnected regions that contain appropriate habitat for wildlife will be critical to the long-term viability of animal populations in urban landscapes.

   RICHNESS; AREAS
AB India is one of the 12 mega biodiversity countries of the world, which represents 11% of world's flora in about 2.4% of global land mass. Approximately 28% of the total Indian flora and 33% of angiosperms occurring in India are endemic. Higher human population density in biodiversity hotspots in India puts undue pressure on these sensitive eco-regions. In the present study, we predict the future distribution of 637 endemic plant species from three biodiversity hotspots in India; Himalaya, Western Ghats, Indo-Burma, based on A1B scenario for year 2050 and 2080. We develop individual variable based models as well as mixed models in MaxEnt by combining ten least co-related bioclimatic variables, two disturbance variables and one physiography variable as predictor variables. The projected changes suggest that the endemic flora will be adversely impacted, even under such a moderate climate scenario. The future distribution is predicted to shift in northern and northeastern direction in Himalaya and Indo-Burma, while in southern and south-western direction in Western Ghats, due to cooler climatic conditions in these regions. In the future distribution of endemic plants, we observe a significant shift and reduction in the distribution range compared to the present distribution. The model predicts a 23.99% range reduction and a 7.70% range expansion in future distribution by 2050, while a 41.34% range reduction and a 24.10% range expansion by 2080. Integration of disturbance and physiography variables along with bioclimatic variables in the models improved the prediction accuracy. Mixed models provide most accurate results for most of the combinations of climatic and non-climatic variables as compared to individual variable based models. We conclude that a) regions with cooler climates and higher moisture availability could serve as refugia for endemic plants in future climatic conditions; b) mixed models provide more accurate results, compared to single variable based models.

AB Human influence on vegetation is a potential confounding factor in pollen-based quantitative climate reconstructions. Here, we examine this issue in China, a region with intensive and long-lasting human influence. We employ modern datasets for human influence index (HID, climate and pollen over continental China to develop quantitative calibration models for HII and two key climate variables (annual precipitation, PANN; annual mean temperature, TANN). We assess the effect of HII on modern pollen assemblages and individual pollen taxa by comparison with climate variables by using constrained ordination methods and boosted regression trees and apply the calibration models to a pollen record spanning the last 6200 years from Lake Tianchi in central China. The results show that HII has smaller influence on the modern pollen data than PANN and TANN, except for in east-central China where the relationship between pollen data and HII is both statistically and ecologically significant. The reconstructed HII from Lake Tianchi remains relatively stable at 6200-2900 cal. yr BP, rises gradually at 2900 -1100 cal. yr BP, and increases abruptly 1100 years ago. These HII trends are roughly concordant with Holocene charcoal and historical population records. The climate reconstructions change in tune with the HII, with an abrupt decline of PANN and a rise of TANN after 1100 cal. yr BR Other palaeoclimatic data contradict the reconstructed patterns of PANN and TANN during the last millennium, suggesting that the climate reconstructions over the last 11 centuries are seriously biased due to the marked increase of human influence. Such a bias likely exists in other pollen-based climate reconstructions from other regions with strong and long-lasting human influence on vegetation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Understanding how climate change can affect crop-pollinator systems helps predict potential geographical mismatches between a crop and its pollinators, and therefore identify areas vulnerable to loss of pollination services. We examined the distribution of orchard species (apples, pears, plums and other top fruits) and their pollinators in Great Britain, for present and future climatic conditions projected for 2050 under the SRES A1B Emissions Scenario. We used a relative index of pollinator availability as a proxy for pollination service. At present, there is a large spatial overlap between orchards and their pollinators, but predictions for 2050 revealed that the most suitable areas for orchards corresponded to low pollinator availability. However, we found that pollinator availability may persist in areas currently used for fruit production, which are predicted to provide suboptimal environmental suitability for orchard species in the future. Our results may be used to identify mitigation options to safeguard orchard production against the risk of pollination failure in Great Britain over the next 50 years; for instance, choosing fruit tree varieties that are adapted to future climatic conditions, or boosting wild pollinators through improving landscape resources. Our approach can be readily applied to other regions and crop systems, and expanded to include different climatic scenarios.

AB The conservation biology of Australasian freshwater mussels is hindered by lack of a taxonomic framework that employs molecular data as a complement to shell characters, larval forms and internal anatomy. The fauna includes more than 32 known species (30+ Hyriidae, 2 Unionidae), but has not been revised for 55 years, despite minor amendments. The hyriids are relics of Gondwana, represented in Australia and New Guinea by the ancestral Velesunioninae and in Australia and New Zealand by the Hyriinae (Tribe Hyridellini). Many taxonomic and phylogeographic issues await resolution, including the relationships between Australasian and South American species, and between Australian and New Zealand species, and the status of species in New Guinea (including uncertain reports of Unionidae) and the Solomon Islands. Once these are clarified, it will be easier to identify threatened species and evaluate the conservation status of the fauna. At present, only seven taxa are named in the IUCN Red List or under national/state legislation, and these are not representative. Threatening processes include altered flow regimes, catchment disturbances, salinisation, pollution and invasive species. While the need for a taxonomic revision is paramount, progress in conservation may depend also upon involving the wider community.

AB Previous studies that evaluated effects of landscape-scale habitat heterogeneity on migratory waterbird distributions were spatially limited and temporally restricted to one major life-history phase. However, effects of landscape-scale habitat heterogeneity on long-distance migratory waterbirds can be studied across the annual cycle using new technologies, including global positioning system satellite transmitters. We used Bayesian discrete choice models to examine the influence of local habitats and landscape composition on habitat selection by a generalist dabbling duck, the mallard (Anas platyrhynchos), in the midcontinent of North America during the non-breeding period. Using a previously published empirical movement metric, we separated the non-breeding period into three seasons, including autumn migration, winter, and spring migration. We defined spatial scales based on movement patterns such that movements > 0.25 and < 30.00 km were classified as local scale and movements > 30.00 km were classified as relocation scale. Habitat selection at the local scale was generally influenced by local and landscape-level variables across all seasons. Variables in top models at the local scale included proximities to cropland, emergent wetland, open water, and woody wetland. Similarly, variables associated with area of cropland, emergent wetland, open water, and woody wetland were also included at the local scale. At the relocation scale, mallards selected resource units based on more generalized variables, including proximity to wetlands and total wetland area. Our results emphasize the role of landscape composition in waterbird habitat selection and provide further support for local wetland landscapes to be considered functional units of waterbird conservation and management.

AB 1. Many capture-recapture surveys of wildlife populations operate in continuous time, but detections are typically aggregated into occasions for analysis, even when exact detection times are available. This discards information and introduces subjectivity, in the form of decisions about occasion definition.
   2. We develop a spatiotemporal Poisson process model for spatially explicit capture-recapture (SECR) surveys that operate continuously and record exact detection times. We show that, except in some special cases (including the case in which detection probability does not change within occasion), temporally aggregated data do not provide sufficient statistics for density and related parameters, and that when detection probability is constant over time, our continuous-time (CT) model is equivalent to an existing model based on detection frequencies. We use the model to estimate jaguar density from a camera-trap survey and conduct a simulation study to investigate the properties of a CT estimator and discrete-occasion estimators with various levels of temporal aggregation. This includes investigation of the effect on the estimators of spatiotemporal correlation induced by animal movement.
   3. The CT estimator is found to be unbiased and more precise than discrete-occasion estimators based on binary capture data (rather than detection frequencies) when there is no spatiotemporal correlation. It is also found to be only slightly biased when there is correlation induced by animal movement, and to be more robust to inadequate detector spacing, while discrete-occasion estimators with binary data can be sensitive to occasion length, particularly in the presence of inadequate detector spacing.
   4. Our model includes as a special case a discrete-occasion estimator based on detection frequencies, and at the same time lays a foundation for the development of more sophisticated CT models and estimators. It allows modelling within-occasion changes in detectability, readily accommodates variation in detector effort, removes subjectivity associated with user-defined occasions and fully utilizes CT data. We identify a need for developing CT methods that incorporate spatiotemporal dependence in detections and see potential for CT models being combined with telemetry-based animal movement models to provide a richer inference framework.

AB Tree species display different abundance patterns over the landscape due to a number of hierarchical factors, all of which have implications when modeling their distribution. While climate is often the primary driver for global to regional scale tree species distributions, modeling of presence and abundance patterns at finer scales, and in landscapes with less topographic variation may require predictors that capture biotic processes and local abiotic conditions. Proxies for biotic and disturbance processes may be captured by a combination of multispectral remote sensing and light detection and ranging (WAR) data. LiDAR data have shown great potential for capturing three-dimensional (3D) characteristics of the forest canopy and a number of these characteristics may have strong relationships with drivers of local tree species distributions. The objective of this study was to investigate the importance of remote sensing derived variables related to biotic and disturbance processes in predicting fine-scale abundance patterns of several dominant tree species in a mixed mature forest in the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence Forest Region, Ontario, Canada. Boosted regression trees, an ensemble classification and regression algorithm, was used to compare tree species abundance models that included LiDAR derived topographic variables with models that included spectral and LiDAR derived topographic and vegetation variables. Average model fit (rescaled Nagelkerke R-2) and predictive accuracy (correlation) improved from 0.12 to 0.63 and 0.25 to 0.71, respectively, when spectral and LiDAR derived vegetation variables were included in the tree species abundance models. This indicates that these variables capture some of the variance in local tree species' abundance distributions generated by biotic and disturbance processes in a landscape with limited topographic and climatic variation. Decreased model performance at higher tree species' abundances additionally suggests that our models do not capture all of the local drivers of tree species' abundance. Variables related to historical and current silvicultural practices may be missing. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Mitogenomic phylogenies have revealed well-supported relationships for many eukaryote groups. In the order Lepidoptera, 113 species mitogenomes had been sequenced (May 14, 2014). However, these data are restricted to ten of the forty-three recognised superfamilies, while it has been challenging to recover large numbers of mitogenomes due to the time and cost required for primer design and sequencing. Nuclear rather than mitochondrial genes have been preferred to reconstruct deep-level lepidopteran phylogenies, without seriously evaluating the potential of entire mitogenomes. Next-generation sequencing methods remove these limitations by providing efficiently massive amounts of sequence data. In the present study, we simultaneously obtained a large number of nymphalid butterfly mitogenomes to evaluate the utility of mitogenomic phylogenies by comparing reconstructions to the now quite well established phylogeny of Nymphalidae.
   Results: We newly obtained 30 nymphalid mitogenomes via pyrosequencing on the Roche 454 GS Junior system, and combined these sequences with publicly accessible data to provide a 70-taxa dataset covering 37 genes for a 15,495 bp alignment. Polymorphic sites were not homogeneously distributed across the gene. Two gene regions, nad6 and 3' end of nad5, were most variable, whereas the cox1 and 5' ends of rmL were most conserved. Phylogenetic relationships inferred by two likelihood methods were congruent and strongly supported (>0.95 posterior probability; ML bootstrap >85%), across the majority of nodes for multiple partitioning strategies and substitution models. Bayes factor results showed that the most highly partitioned dataset is the preferred strategy among different partitioning schemes. The most striking phylogenetic findings were that the subfamily Danainae not Libytheinae was sister of the remaining brush-footed butterflies and that, within Limenitidini, the genus Athyma was clearly polyphyletic. None of the single-gene phylogenies recovered the highly supported topologies generated on the basis of the whole mitogenomic data.
   Conclusions: Thirty mitogenomes were assembled with 89% completeness from the contigs of pyrosequencing-derived reads. Entire mitogenomes or higher-quality sequences could be obtained by increasing pyrosequencing read coverage or by additional Sanger sequencing. Our mitogenomic phylogenies provide robust nodal support at a range of levels, demonstrating that mitogenomes are both accurate and efficient molecular markers for inferring butterfly phylogeny.

AB Potential conflicts between biodiversity conservation and climate-change mitigation can result in trade-offs in multiple-use land management. This study aimed to detect possible changes in land-use patterns in response to biodiversity conservation and climate-change mitigation measures and the effects on ecosystem services across a watershed. We analyzed land-cover change based on past and future scenarios in the rural Kushiro watershed in northern japan. The analysis showed that if no conservation measures were implemented and the timber and agricultural industry remained small until 2060, supporting and provisioning services would decline due to less land management. Although biodiversity conservation measures are predicted to improve three of the ecosystem services that we studied, carbon sequestration and timber production would be improved to a greater degree by climate-change mitigation measures. The greatest land-cover changes are likely to occur in the unprotected area around the middle reaches of the Kushiro River, and such changes could affect the provision of ecosystem services throughout the entire watershed. Thus, our findings indicate that landuse decisions for the middle reaches of the watershed are particularly important for managing the integrated ecosystem services of the entire watershed for the future.

TI The Impact of Modelling Rate Heterogeneity among Sites on Phylogenetic

AB Phylogenetic analyses of DNA sequence data can provide estimates of evolutionary rates and timescales. Nearly all phylogenetic methods rely on accurate models of nucleotide substitution. A key feature of molecular evolution is the heterogeneity of substitution rates among sites, which is often modelled using a discrete gamma distribution. A widely used derivative of this is the gamma-invariable mixture model, which assumes that a proportion of sites in the sequence are completely resistant to change, while substitution rates at the remaining sites are gamma-distributed. For data sampled at the intraspecific level, however, biological assumptions involved in the invariable-sites model are commonly violated. We examined the use of these models in analyses of five intraspecific data sets. We show that using 6-10 rate categories for the discrete gamma distribution of rates among sites is sufficient to provide a good approximation of the marginal likelihood. Increasing the number of gamma rate categories did not have a substantial effect on estimates of the substitution rate or coalescence time, unless rates varied strongly among sites in a non-gamma-distributed manner. The assumption of a proportion of invariable sites provided a better approximation of the asymptotic marginal likelihood when the number of gamma categories was small, but had minimal impact on estimates of rates and coalescence times. However, the estimated proportion of invariable sites was highly susceptible to changes in the number of gamma rate categories. The concurrent use of gamma and invariable-site models for intraspecific data is not biologically meaningful and has been challenged on statistical grounds; here we have found that the assumption of a proportion of invariable sites has no obvious impact on Bayesian estimates of rates and timescales from intraspecific data.

AB Agricultural changes related to the intensification of farming practices and the simplification of landscape elements often occur simultaneously. Their respective effects on biodiversity are thus difficult to disentangle and are poorly understood. This study assessed the relative contribution of each component of agricultural intensification on taxonomic and functional bird communities.
   The bird communities studied were composed of 70 species, both farmland and non-farmland birds, found in 66 fields covering three main cereal departments of France. Herbicide dose was related to measurable negative effects on the Community Specialization Index (CSI). Overall, the proportion of habitat specialists, particularly of herbivorous species, decreased, and the proportion of generalists increased as pesticide doses increased. Pesticides also had a positive effect on total abundance and richness, whereas no influence of insecticide or fungicide doses could be detected. Landscape simplification was associated with a loss of bird species diversity and an increase in the CSI.
   Our findings suggest that the intensification of agriculture in this area, as reflected by increasing pesticide doses, modified communities by homogenizing species assemblages, whereas landscape element simplification led to the selection of only a few typical farmland birds enabled to persist in a simplified arable landscape. These results highlight the importance of combining taxonomic with functional diversity indices to fully understand changes in communities that occur in response to agricultural intensification.

AB The development of crops which are well suited to growth under future environmental conditions such as higher atmospheric CO2 concentrations ([CO2]) is essential to meeting the challenge of ensuring food security in the face of the growing human population and changing climate. A high-yielding indica rice variety (Oryza sativa L. cv. Takanari) has been recently identified as a potential candidate for such breeding, due to its high productivity in present [CO2]. To test if it could further increase its productivity under elevated [CO2] (eCO(2)), Takanari was grown in the paddy field under season-long free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE, approximately 200 mu mol mol(-1) above ambient [CO2]) and its leaf physiology was compared with the representative japonica variety 'Koshihikari'. Takanari showed consistently higher midday photosynthesis and stomatal conductance than Koshihikari under both ambient and FACE growth conditions over 2 years. Maximum ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylation and electron transport rates were higher for Takanari at the mid-grain filling stage in both years. Mesophyll conductance was higher in Takanari than in Koshihikari at the late grain-filling stage. In contrast to Koshihikari, Takanari grown under FACE conditions showed no decrease in total leaf nitrogen on an area basis relative to ambient-grown plants. Chl content was higher in Takanari than in Koshihikari at the same leaf nitrogen level. These results indicate that Takanari maintains its superiority over Koshihikari in regards to its leaf-level productivity when grown in elevated [CO2] and it may be a valuable resource for rice breeding programs which seek to increase crop productivity under current and future [CO2].

AB Periodically-harvested fisheries closures are emerging as a socially acceptable and locally implementable way to balance concerns about conserving ecosystem function and sustaining livelihoods. Across the Indo-Pacific periodically-harvested closures are commonly employed, yet their contribution towards more sustainable fisheries remains largely untested in the social and ecological context of tropical small-scale fisheries. To address this, we use an interdisciplinary approach to examine harvesting dynamics that would affect sustainability, namely, fishing effort, yield, gear and method use, periodicity of harvesting, controls placed on harvesting and resource owners' decisions to open and close four fishing grounds in Solomon Islands. We compare these fishing patterns with those on surrounding, continuously open fishing grounds. Our study shows that total effort and total catch from periodically-harvested reef closures are low to moderate compared to reefs open to continuous fishing. When periodically-harvested closures were opened, effort in the closures was relatively intense, however, in most cases yield did not exceed annual benchmarks of sustainability described by previous studies. In some cases, harvesting during openings was restricted to a single taxon and single fishing gear and method, while in others there was unrestricted multi-species and multi-method harvesting. The duration and frequency of openings were highly variable, with open periods ranging from a single night to one month in duration, and occurring between one and 15 times per year. Fishing during openings was permitted for entire fishing communities in some cases, and only for specific rights-holding families in others. Decisions to open periodically-harvested closures tended to be based on immediate social or economic needs, and the openings provided a small boost to fish catch landed in communities. While periodically-harvested closures may alleviate fishing pressure in a small area of fishing grounds by reducing the opportunity to fish, openings of long duration or high frequency, combined with heavy or destructive exploitation, may lead to unsustainable harvesting within the area.

AB Understanding long-term trends in species abundance and distribution represents an important challenge for future research in the deep sea, particularly as management of human impacts becomes a more important concern. However, until natural higher frequency variability is better understood, it will be difficult to interpret any long-term trends that may be apparent in data sets. We present here the results of the first year of observations at the NEPTUNE Canada cabled observatory site in Barkley Canyon, off the coast of Vancouver Island, in the northeast Pacific Ocean. Presence/absence and abundance data for 28 faunal groups were extracted from daily video records from an observatory camera. Concurrent CTD and current meter data were collected from co-located instruments. Water mass properties, currents and faunal community composition exhibited notable seasonal trends. Distinct seasonal faunal groupings were observed, together with summer and winter trends in temperature, salinity and current patterns. Variations in abundance of decapod crustaceans and fishes were responsible for most differences between faunal groups. We suggest that faunal composition may have been responding to seasonal variations in food availability, together with direct and indirect physical influences on predator and prey abundance.

AB The most pervasive threats to biological diversity are directly or indirectly linked to the road networks. For this reason, over the last few decades, interest in the study of the ecological characteristics of the edges associated with roads has increased. This work aims to investigate the effect of roads as a human-induced disturbance on the plant diversity in two managed Mediterranean forest sites, focusing on the responses of plants species richness, evenness, composition and taxonomic diversity.
   A stratified random sampling was performed in two protected areas located in Tuscany, Central Italy. The species richness, composition and abundance were measured in 53.20 x 20 m plots. Ordinary Least Square and quantile regressions were used to study the effect of the roads on species richness, evenness and taxonomic distinctness, and redundancy analysis was used to examine the species composition. Generalized linear models in conjunction with an Information Criterion-based approach to model selection were used to test the role of road distance in the structure of forest plant biodiversity.
   Our findings indicated a clear relationship between road distance and different plant biodiversity facets, which showed its maximum effect in the first 0-20 m forest-to-road segment and a mitigation after the 200 m threshold. Furthermore, the presence and abundance of many key forest species, such as Fagus sylvatica and Abies alba, were influenced more by the road distance than by other environmental gradients. The few remnants of core forest habitats in the Mediterranean basin highlight the need to recognize that road construction and maintenance have several ecological implications and accordingly require long-term monitoring programs.

AB Surveying and declaring disease freedom in wildlife is difficult because information on population size and spatial distribution is often inadequate. We describe and demonstrate a novel spatial model of wildlife disease-surveillance data for predicting the probability of freedom of bovine tuberculosis (caused by Mycobacterium bovis) in New Zealand, in which the introduced brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula) is the primary wildlife reservoir. Using parameters governing home-range size, probability of capture, probability of infection and spatial relative risks of infection we employed survey data on reservoir hosts and spillover sentinels to make inference on the probability of eradication. Our analysis revealed high sensitivity of model predictions to parameter values, which demonstrated important differences in the information contained in survey data of host-reservoir and spillover-sentinel species. The modelling can increase cost efficiency by reducing the likelihood of prematurely declaring success due to insufficient control, and avoiding unnecessary costs due to excessive control and monitoring.

AB Field studies have demonstrated that aluminum (Al) toxicity is low in no-till systems during cropping seasons that have adequate and well-distributed rainfall. This study evaluated the performance of corn (Zea mays L.) and soybean (Glycine max L. Merrill) on an acid loamy soil under a long-term no-till system, in response to surface liming and as affected by genotypic tolerance to Al and water stress.
   A field trial examined the effect of surface application of lime (0, 4, 8, and 12 Mg ha(-1)) on no-till corn and soybean nutrition and yield. Trials were also carried out in undisturbed soil columns taken from the unlimed and limed plots. Two hybrids/cultivars of corn and soybean, one sensitive and the other moderately sensitive to Al were grown at two soil moisture levels with and without water stress (50 % and 80 % water filled pore space).
   Alleviating soil acidity by liming improved nutrition and increased grain yields of corn and soybean. The benefits of liming on root length density, nutrient uptake and shoot biomass production of corn and soybean were more pronounced in Al-sensitive genotypes under water stress.
   The results suggest that plants exposed to drought stress under no-till systems are more affected by Al toxicity.

AB The small geographical range of highly endemic species is an important factor to be considered in conservation initiatives because it can increase their risk of extinction, as well decrease their probability of discovery. In this study, we use environmental niche modeling (ENM) to investigate the distribution of Brachycephalus, an anuran genus characterized by microendemic species living mostly in montane habitats along the Brazilian Atlantic Rainforest. Given that traditional ENM is not possible in the case of Brachycephalus because most of its species have limited geographical ranges, we analyzed an ensemble dataset that combined records of most described species, as well as new species that are currently being described, while accounting for heterogeneity in their climatic niches. Niche heterogeneity was quantified by ordination of the bioclimatic variables associated with their occurrence records, followed by unguided clustering of the resulting ordination scores. Out of an initial dataset of 544 records, careful curation reduced it to 75 records of 24 species and 71 localities. Interestingly, the three major clusters of climatic niches found in Brachycephalus corresponded largely to the three previously recognized phylogenetic lineages in the genus. The pernix cluster included the highly endemic species from southern Brazil that were most restricted to high-elevation areas, whereas the didactylus cluster encompassed species with broader geographical ranges that extended into lowland regions of the Atlantic Rainforest. Finally, the ephippium cluster included species from southeastern Brazil with intermediate levels of endemism. The detection of several isolated locations with potentially suitable habitats indicate that the diversity of Brachycephalus could still be considerably underestimated. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB We address the global deficit of data describing kelp forest distribution, relative covers and biomass by testing the ability of species distribution models to predict these attributes at locations where data are currently limited. We integrated biological ground truth data with high-resolution environmental datasets to develop generalized additive models that accurately predict the structure of Laminaria forests within the Bay of Morlaix (48A degrees 42'42aEuro(3)N, 3A degrees 55'40aEuro(3)W). Forest distribution and proportional covers were predicted using water depth, light availability, wave exposure and sediment dynamics. The biomass of individual kelp species was modeled by supplementing these same variables with measures of seafloor slope and benthic position. Biomass predictions for Laminaria digitata and Laminaria hyperborea contrast the physiological tolerances of these species to light and wave exposure gradients. As a direct management output, we produced high-resolution maps (25 m(2) grids) that closely match independent field data and provide vital information for marine spatial planning.

AB The integration of ecosystem services in ecological restoration projects presents an opportunity for enhancing benefits to human livelihood and funding sources as well as generating public support for such initiatives. This study reviewed the global trends in integrating ecosystem services in basin-scale restoration projects through bibliographic analysis. Few studies appear to incorporate ecosystem services, possibly due to the inconsistency and absence of the use of universally accepted classifications. Our review notes an increasing trend from 2006 onward toward the inclusion and citation of this concept, although its use is still limited. In this review, the supporting service was found to be the most cited (8), followed by regulatory (3), cultural (1) and provisioning (1) services. Identifying the number of services related to a restoration action was problematic when the services were not explicitly cited. We identify opportunities for increased integration of ecosystem services in basin-scale restoration projects, suggesting a conceptual framework following from new hierarchical maps. This is based on congruence between degrading processes or threat maps (e.g., thresholds of impacts) and ecosystem service maps. The resultant map will facilitate the targeting of threatened service supply at different scales from the basin scale to the scale of the restoration site. We urge the scientific community to standardize definitions and create methodologies and software tools that facilitate the incorporation of ecosystem services in large-scale restoration plans.

AB Remote sensing offers a unique perspective of plant vigor based on reflectance of the crops' canopy. The goal of this study was to determine how deep into the maize canopy red-edge chlorophyll index, Cl-red edge. was affected by foliar chlorophyll (Chl) content and leaf area. Reflectance in the range 400 to 900 nm was measured at both the leaf and canopy levels and was used to determine foliar Chl and total canopy Chl content using Cl-red edge. Statistical techniques, a hierarchical regression and three Aikaike Information Criteria, were used to determine how many leaf layers are sensed by the Cl-red edge. All statistical techniques showed that the Cl-red edge senses the chlorophyll content of the upper 7 to 9 leaf layers in a maize canopy and that remote sensing technique is able to accurately estimate maize canopy Chl content.

AB Understanding how patterns of wildfire activity across biomes are shaped by heterogeneity in biomass resources to burn and atmospheric conditions conducive to burning is a high research priority in the context of global environmental change. Along a latitudinal gradient (25 to 568 S) from semi-arid scrublands through Mediterranean-type vegetation to wet forests in southwestern South America (SSA) we analyzed influences of mean climate and interannual climate variability on fire activity using documentary fire records from 1984 to 2008. We identified large regions with common temporal variability in annual area burned, related this variability to local interannual climate variability and in turn to modes of the major tropical and extratropical climate drivers of the southern hemisphere-El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Antarctic Oscillation (AAO). Differences in fire activity response to interannual climate variability were related to the relative influences of available biomass to burn, and to weather effects on amounts of fine fuels and fuel moisture conditions. The pattern of average fire activity along this latitudinal moisture/productivity gradient corresponds well with the varying constraints model. This model predicts low fire activity towards the arid extreme due to reduced burnable biomass and again towards the humid extreme due to infrequent weather suitable for drying fuels, and predicts a broad zone of high fire activity at intermediate locations where resources to burn are abundant in all years and fuel moisture dries under reliably dry summer conditions. The dominant influence on interannual climate variability is AAO, which explained most of the variability in fire activity both by reducing seasonal precipitation in mesic and wet forests where fire is dependent on infrequent drought and by enhancing fine fuel production in Mediterranean-type vegetation where fuel amount and continuity constrain fire activity. In the context of the drying and warming trends in SSA related to the continued positive anomaly in AAO, our results underscore the importance of the varying constraints on fire activity and modulation of fire-climate relationships by different vegetation types, which is a much needed step toward developing fire projections under future climate.

AB Our understanding of species phylogeography in much of the Palearctic is incomplete. In addition, many existing studies based solely on mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) can provide a biased view of phylogeographic history because of the effects of lineage sorting, natural selection, or hybridization. We analyzed 13 introns to assess a mtDNA study of the Eurasian nuthatch (Sitta europaea) that suggested a seemingly contemporaneous origin of distinct taxa in the Caucasus, Europe, and Asia. Neutrality tests showed no evidence of selection on either the mtDNA or nuclear sequences. Most nuclear gene trees, except for Z-linked ones, did not recover the three lineages, which we attribute to recent splitting. Analyses of the 13 introns combined revealed the same three groups as did the mtDNA and suggested that nuthatches experienced a trichotomous (or two indistinguishable) split(s) 12 million years ago (Mya) and have remained isolated with trifling if not zero gene flow since then, and the Asian group increased in population size. This result demonstrates the usefulness of mtDNA in discovering phylogeographic patterns. The use of multiple nuclear loci facilitated detection of an introgressed individual and improved estimates of process parameters such as divergence time and population expansion. We recommend that phylogeographic studies should be based on both mtDNA and nuclear genes.

AB Rubisco is composed of eight small subunits coded for by the nuclear RBCS multigene family and eight large subunits coded for by the rbcL gene in the plastome. For synthesis of the Rubisco holoenzyme, both genes need to be expressed coordinately. To investigate this molecular mechanism, the protein synthesis of two subunits of Rubisco was characterized in transgenic rice (Oryza sativa) plants with overexpression or antisense suppression of the RBCS gene. Total RBCS and rbcL messenger RNA (mRNA) levels and RBCS and RbcL synthesis simultaneously increased in RBCS-sense plants, although the increase in total RBCS mRNA level was greater. In RBCS-antisense plants, the levels of these mRNAs and the synthesis of the corresponding proteins declined to a similar extent. The amount of RBCS synthesized was tightly correlated with rbcL mRNA level among genotypes but not associated with changes in mRNA levels of other major chloroplast-encoded photosynthetic genes. The level of rbcL mRNA, in turn, was tightly correlated with the amount of RbcL synthesized, the molar ratio of RBCS synthesis to RbcL synthesis being identical irrespective of genotype. Polysome loading of rbcL mRNA was not changed. These results demonstrate that the availability of RBCS protein up-regulates the gene expression of rbcL primarily at the transcript level in a quantitative manner for stoichiometric assembly of Rubisco holoenzyme.

AB Nitrogen is a dominant regulator of vegetation dynamics, net primary production, and terrestrial carbon cycles; however, most ecosystem models use a rather simplistic relationship between leaf nitrogen content and photosynthetic capacity. Such an approach does not consider how patterns of nitrogen allocation may change with differences in light intensity, growing-season temperature and CO2 concentration. To account for this known variability in nitrogen-photosynthesis relationships, we develop a mechanistic nitrogen allocation model based on a trade-off of nitrogen allocated between growth and storage, and an optimization of nitrogen allocated among light capture, electron transport, carboxylation, and respiration. The developed model is able to predict the acclimation of photosynthetic capacity to changes in CO2 concentration, temperature, and radiation when evaluated against published data of V-c,V-max (maximum carboxylation rate) and J(max) (maximum electron transport rate). A sensitivity analysis of the model for herbaceous plants, deciduous and evergreen trees implies that elevated CO2 concentrations lead to lower allocation of nitrogen to carboxylation but higher allocation to storage. Higher growing-season temperatures cause lower allocation of nitrogen to carboxylation, due to higher nitrogen requirements for light capture pigments and for storage. Lower levels of radiation have a much stronger effect on allocation of nitrogen to carboxylation for herbaceous plants than for trees, resulting from higher nitrogen requirements for light capture for herbaceous plants. As far as we know, this is the first model of complete nitrogen allocation that simultaneously considers nitrogen allocation to light capture, electron transport, carboxylation, respiration and storage, and the responses of each to altered environmental conditions. We expect this model could potentially improve our confidence in simulations of carbon-nitrogen interactions and the vegetation feedbacks to climate in Earth system models.

AB Water availability and plant community composition alter plant nutrient availability and the accumulation of plant defence compounds therefore having an impact on herbivore performance. Combined effects of drought stress and plant community composition on leaf chemicals and herbivore performance are largely unexplored. The objective of our study was, therefore, to find out the impact of extreme drought and of plant community composition on plant-herbivore interactions. Larvae of the generalist butterfly Spodoptera littoralis were reared on leaves of the grass Holcus lanatus which was grown in experimental communities, differing in species- and functional group richness. These communities were either subjected to extreme drought or remained under ambient climatic conditions. Drought decreased relative water content, soluble protein content, nitrogen and total phenol content and increased the content of carbohydrates in the grass. As a consequence, the larvae feeding on drought-exposed plants revealed a longer larval stage, increased pupal weight and higher adult eclosion rates. Plant community composition mainly caused changes to the defensive compounds of the grass, but also marginally affected protein and carbohydrate content. Larvae feeding on species-richest communities without legumes showed the highest mortality. Our findings imply that climate change that is projected to increase the frequency of severe droughts, as well as alter plant community compositions, is likely to affect arthropod-plant interactions through an alteration of leaf chemicals.

AB The effective population size (Ne) could be the ideal parameter for monitoring populations of conservation concern as it conveniently summarizes both the evolutionary potential of the population and its sensitivity to genetic stochasticity. However, tracing its change through time is difficult in natural populations. We applied four new methods for estimating Ne from a single sample of genotypes to trace temporal change in Ne for bears in the Northern Dinaric Mountains. We genotyped 510 bears using 20 microsatellite loci and determined their age. The samples were organized into cohorts with regard to the year when the animals were born and yearly samples with age categories for every year when they were alive. We used the Estimator by Parentage Assignment (EPA) to directly estimate both Ne and generation interval for each yearly sample. For cohorts, we estimated the effective number of breeders (Nb) using linkage disequilibrium, sibship assignment and approximate Bayesian computation methods and extrapolated these estimates to Ne using the generation interval. The Ne estimate by EPA is 276 (183350 95% CI), meeting the inbreeding-avoidance criterion of Ne > 50 but short of the long-term minimum viable population goal of Ne > 500. The results obtained by the other methods are highly consistent with this result, and all indicate a rapid increase in Ne probably in the late 1990s and early 2000s. The new single-sample approaches to the estimation of Ne provide efficient means for including Ne in monitoring frameworks and will be of great importance for future management and conservation.

AB The control of invasive species is a major challenge to the preservation of native ecosystems, both terrestrial and aquatic. A population of the invasive common carp, Cyprinus carpio, was detected in Lakes Sorell and Crescent, Tasmania, Australia, in the mid-1990s. Early detection allowed for the containment of their population to this lacustrine system. Radio-telemetry was subsequently used over a 5-year period to understand seasonal distribution of carp in relation to environmental parameters to guide efficient eradication strategies. The present study found that fish displayed increased mobility during spring-summer periods, moving into shallow habitat rich in macrophytes, particularly during years of high lake levels. During years of low lake levels, this pattern was altered with frequent use of a rocky 'secondary' habitat in Lake Sorell. During winter, carp congregated in deeper habitat in Lake Sorell, whereas no habitat-specific winter aggregations were found in Lake Crescent. The increased knowledge of spatio-temporal preferences of carp provided a basis for deploying barriers to facilitate the capture of fish and sabotage spawning events. The results have led to the eradication of carp from Lake Crescent and a significant reduction of their population in Lake Sorell.

AB Background: Protein sequence evolution is constrained by the biophysics of folding and function, causing interdependence between interacting sites in the sequence. However, current site independent models of sequence evolutions do not take this into account. Recent attempts to integrate the influence of structure and biophysics into phylogenetic models via statistical/informational approaches have not resulted in expected improvements in model performance. This suggests that further innovations are needed for progress in this field.
   Results: Here we develop a coarse-grained physics-based model of protein folding and binding function, and compare it to a popular informational model. We find that both models violate the assumption of the native sequence being close to a thermodynamic optimum, causing directional selection away from the native state. Sampling and simulation show that the physics-based model is more specific for fold-defining interactions that vary less among residue type. The informational model diffuses further in sequence space with fewer barriers and tends to provide less support for an invariant sites model, although amino acid substitutions are generally conservative. Both approaches produce sequences with natural features like dN/dS < 1 and gamma-distributed rates across sites.
   Conclusions: Simple coarse-grained models of protein folding can describe some natural features of evolving proteins but are currently not accurate enough to use in evolutionary inference. This is partly due to improper packing of the hydrophobic core. We suggest possible improvements on the representation of structure, folding energy, and binding function, as regards both native and non-native conformations, and describe a large number of possible applications for such a model.

AB Autumnal input of leaf litter is a pivotal energy source in most headwater streams. In temporary streams, however, water stress may lead to a seasonal shift in leaf abscission. Leaves accumulate at the surface of the dry streambed or in residual pools and are subject to physicochemical preconditioning before decomposition starts after flow recovery. In this study, we experimentally tested the effect of photodegradation on sunlit streambeds and anaerobic fermentation in anoxic pools on leaf decomposition during the subsequent flowing phase. To mimic field preconditioning, we exposed Populus tremula leaves to UV-VIS irradiation and wet-anoxic conditions in the laboratory. Subsequently, we quantified leaf mass loss of preconditioned leaves and the associated decomposer community in five low-order temporary streams using coarse and fine mesh litter bags. On average, mass loss after approximately 45 days was 4 and 7% lower when leaves were preconditioned by irradiation and anoxic conditions, respectively. We found a lower chemical quality and lower ergosterol content (a proxy for living fungal biomass) in leaves from the anoxic preconditioning, but no effects on macroinvertebrate assemblages were detected for any preconditioning treatment. Overall, results from this study suggest a reduced processing efficiency of organic matter in temporary streams due to preconditioning during intermittence of flow leading to reduced substrate quality and repressed decomposer activity. These preconditioning effects may become more relevant in the future given the expected worldwide increase in the geographical extent of intermittent flow as a consequence of global change.

AB In this paper we study an isolated high-mountain (Sierra Nevada, SE Iberian Peninsula) to identify the potential trends in the habitat-suitability of five key species (i.e. species that domain a given vegetation type and drive the conditions for appearance of many other species) corresponding to four vegetation types occupying different altitudinal belts, that might result from a sudden climatic shift. We used topographical variables and downscaled climate warming simulations to build a high-resolution spatial database (10 m) according to four different climate warming scenarios for the twenty-first century. The spatial changes in the suitable habitat were simulated using a species distribution model, in order to analyze altitudinal shifts and potential habitat loss of the key species. Thus, the advance and receding fronts of known occurrence locations were computed by introducing a new concept named differential suitability, and potential patterns of substitution among the key species were established. The average mean temperature trend show an increase of 4.8A degrees C, which will induce the vertical shift of the suitable habitat for all the five key species considered at an average rate of 11.57 m/year. According to the simulations, the suitable habitat for the key species inhabiting the summit area, where most of the endemic and/or rare species are located, may disappear before the middle of the century. The other key species considered show moderate to drastic suitable habitat loss depending on the considered scenario. Climate warming should provoke a strong substitution dynamics between species, increasing spatial competition between both of them. In this study, we introduce the application of differential suitability concept into the analysis of potential impact of climate change, forest management and environmental monitoring, and discuss the limitations and uncertainties of these simulations.

AB Question: Biological soil crusts (BSCs) exist in arid and semi-arid ecosystems worldwide, and their recovery following the removal of a disturbance agent is integral to the rehabilitation of degraded landscapes. We asked: what is the likelihood of success and time frame of BSC recovery in vegetation remnants of southeast Australia, following livestock exclusion by fencing.
   Location: Dryland agricultural region of northwest Victoria, Australia.
   Methods: We conducted a "space for time" study of BSC recovery across 21 sites where livestock have been excluded by fencing between 1 and 450 years ago, and used boosted regression tree models to explore the response of BSCs to livestock exclusion while controlling for the influence of environmental variables on BSC abundance.
   Results: Our results show a relatively rapid, passive recovery of BSCs following livestock exclusion, with cover stabilizing after 20 years. Sites heavily disturbed by livestock grazing at the time of fencing stabilized at a lower cover. In contrast to studies from other countries, our results suggest mosses, not cyanobacteria, are the important colonizers in our study region.
   Conclusions: Ecosystem function in degraded remnants of southern Australia can be improved in a relatively short time frame through passive recovery alone. This knowledge will benefit land managers choosing between restoration options in disturbed and fragmented arid-landscapes.

AB Recent advances in ecological modeling have focused on novel methods for characterizing the environment that use presence-only data and machine-learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of species occurrence. These novel methods may have great potential for land suitability applications in the developing world where detailed land cover information is often unavailable or incomplete. This paper assesses the adaptation and application of the presence-only geographic species distribution model, MaxEnt, for agricultural crop suitability mapping in a rural Thailand where lowland paddy rice and upland field crops predominant. To assess this modeling approach, three independent crop presence datasets were used including a social-demographic survey of farm households, a remote sensing classification of land use/land cover, and ground control points, used for geodetic and thematic reference that vary in their geographic distribution and sample size. Disparate environmental data were integrated to characterize environmental settings across Nang Rang District, a region of approximately 1300 sq. km in size. Results indicate that the MaxEnt model is capable of modeling crop suitability for upland and lowland crops, including rice varieties, although model results varied between datasets due to the high sensitivity of the model to the distribution of observed crop locations in geographic and environmental space. Accuracy assessments indicate that model outcomes were influenced by the sample size and the distribution of sample points in geographic and environmental space. The need for further research into accuracy assessments of presence-only models lacking true absence data is discussed. We conclude that the MaxEnt model can provide good estimates of crop suitability, but many areas need to be carefully scrutinized including geographic distribution of input data and assessment methods to ensure realistic modeling results.

AB Aim In recent decades there has been a marked decline in the numbers of African lions (Panthera leo), especially in West Africa where the species is regionally endangered. Based on the climatological history of western Africa, we hypothesize that West and Central African lions have a unique evolutionary history, which is reflected by their genetic makeup.
   Location Sub-Saharan Africa and India, with special focus on West and Central Africa.
   Method In this study 126 samples, throughout the lion's complete geographic range, were subjected to phylogenetic analyses. DNA sequences of a mitochondrial region, containing cytochrome b, tRNAPro, tRNAThr and the left part of the control region, were analysed.
   Results Bayesian, maximum likelihood and maximum parsimony analyses consistently showed a distinction between lions from West and Central Africa and lions from southern and East Africa. West and Central African lions are more closely related to Asiatic lions than to the southern and East African lions. This can be explained by a Pleistocene extinction and subsequent recolonization of West Africa from refugia in the Middle East. This is further supported by the fact that the West and Central African clade shows relatively little genetic diversity and is therefore thought to be an evolutionarily young clade.
   Main conclusions The taxonomic division between an African and an Asian subspecies does not fully reflect the overall genetic diversity within lions. In order to conserve genetic diversity within the species, genetically distinct lineages should be prioritized. Understanding the geographic pattern of genetic diversity is key to developing conservation strategies, both for in situ management and for breeding of captive stocks.

AB Most spiders use venom to paralyze their prey and are commonly feared for their potential to cause injury to humans. In North America, one species in particular, Loxosceles reclusa (brown recluse spider, Sicariidae), causes the majority of necrotic wounds induced by the Araneae. However, its distributional limitations are poorly understood and, as a result, medical professionals routinely misdiagnose brown recluse bites outside endemic areas, confusing putative spider bites for other serious conditions. To address the issue of brown recluse distribution, we employ ecological niche modeling to investigate the present and future distributional potential of this species. We delineate range boundaries and demonstrate that under future climate change scenarios, the spider's distribution may expand northward, invading previously unaffected regions of the USA. At present, the spider's range is centered in the USA, from Kansas east to Kentucky and from southern Iowa south to Louisiana. Newly influenced areas may include parts of Nebraska, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, South Dakota, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. These results illustrate a potential negative consequence of climate change on humans and will aid medical professionals in proper bite identification/treatment, potentially reducing bite misdiagnoses.

AB DNA marker-assisted selection appears to be a promising strategy for improving rates of leaf photosynthesis in rice. The rate of leaf photosynthesis was significantly higher in a high-yielding indica variety, Habataki, than in the most popular Japanese variety, Koshihikari, at the full heading stage as a result of the higher level of leaf nitrogen at the same rate of application of nitrogen and the higher stomatal conductance even when the respective levels of leaf nitrogen were the same. The higher leaf nitrogen content of Habataki was caused by the greater accumulation of nitrogen by plants. The higher stomatal conductance of Habataki was caused by the higher hydraulic conductance. Using progeny populations and selected lines derived from a cross between Koshihikari and Habataki, it was possible to identify the genomic regions responsible for the rate of photosynthesis within a 2.1 Mb region between RM17459 and RM17552 and within a 1.2 Mb region between RM6999 and RM22529 on the long arm of chromosome 4 and on the short arm of chromosome 8, respectively. The designated region on chromosome 4 of Habataki was responsible for both the increase in the nitrogen content of leaves and hydraulic conductance in the plant by increasing the root surface area. The designated region on chromosome 8 of Habataki was responsible for the increase in hydraulic conductance by increasing the root hydraulic conductivity. The results suggest that it may be possible to improve photosynthesis in rice leaves by marker-assisted selection that focuses on these regions of chromosomes 4 and 8.

AB Spatial ecology focuses on the role of space and time in ecological processes and events from a local to a global scale and is particularly relevant in developing environmental policy and (mandated) monitoring goals. In other words, spatial ecology is where geography and ecology intersect, and high-quality geospatial data and analysis tools are required to address emerging issues in spatial ecology. In this commentary and review for the International Journal of GIS Special Issue on Spatial Ecology, we highlight selected current research priorities in spatial ecology and describe geospatial data and methods for addressing these tasks. Geoinformation research themes are identified in population ecology, community and landscape ecology, and ecosystem ecology, and these themes are further linked to the assessment of ecosystem services. Methods in spatial ecology benefit from explicit consideration of spatial autocorrelation, and applications discussed in this review include species distribution modeling, remote sensing of community and ecosystem properties, and models of climate change. The linkages of the Special Issue papers to these emerging issues are described.

AB Climate change is expected to alter freshwater communities and accelerate extinction, but the exact processes are poorly known. Here, we appraise interannual variation between 2 sympatric planarians (Crenobia alpina and Phagocata vitta) in upland Welsh streams over 25 y during which 1 of this pair (C. alpina) disappeared. We tested 3 nonexclusive hypotheses involving: 1) long-term changes in stream chemistry, 2) interspecific competition, and 3) climatic variation or directional change to explain this apparent local extinction. Several lines of evidence revealed potential exploitation competition between C. alpina and P. vitta. Coexistence was confined to conditions with high prey abundance (recorded as the abundance of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera) and summer temperatures <12.5 degrees C, whereas P. vitta dominated at sites with higher temperature, greater discharge, and lower prey abundance. The loss of C. alpina in the Llyn Brianne experimental catchments coincided with the largest-ever positive amplification of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) in 1989 to 1994, accompanied by increased stream temperature, increased winter discharge, 2 summer droughts, and markedly reduced prey abundance. We suggest that interspecific competition and this prolonged climatic event acted in concert to favor P. vitta over C. alpina. Since its local loss, summer stream temperatures have generally exceeded the favorable range for C. alpina and, coupled with weak dispersal ability, probably explain its continued absence. Our data are consistent with the prediction that extreme climatic events will affect small, fluctuating populations. Nevertheless, this case study demonstrates clear difficulties in identifying unequivocally the exact climatic processes causing extinction where: 1) evidence is confined to weak inference, 2) responses to complex climatic events are nonlinear, 3) interactions occur among species or between climate and ecological processes, and 4) assessments are made retrospectively following extinctions.

AB The Filago group (Asteraceae, Gnaphalieae) comprises eleven genera, mainly distributed in Eurasia, northern Africa and northern America: Ancistrocarphus, Bombycilaena, Chamaepus, Cymbolaena, Evacidium, Evax, Filago, Logfia, Micropus, Psilocarphus and Stylocline. The main morphological character that defines the group is that the receptacular paleae subtend, and more or less enclose, the female florets. The aims of this work are, with the use of three chloroplast DNA regions (rpl32-trnL intergenic spacer, trnL intron, and trnL-trnF intergenic spacer) and two nuclear DNA regions (ITS, ETS), to test whether the Filago group is monophyletic; to place its members within Gnaphalieae using a broad sampling of the tribe; and to investigate in detail the phylogenetic relationships among the Old World members of the Filago group and provide some new insight into the generic circumscription and infrageneric classification based on natural entities. Our results do not show statistical support for a monophyletic Filago group. The traditional generic circumscription of most of the genera, as well as the traditional infrageneric classification of the genus Filago, do not correlate with the inferred phylogenetic relationships. A monophyletic circumscription of Filago and a new subgeneric treatment for this genus are proposed, this involving description of a new subgenus (Filago subg. Crocidion Andres-Sanchez & Galbany, subg. nov.) and four new combinations (Filago subg. Pseudevax (DC.) Andres-Sanchez & Galbany, comb. et stat. nov.; Filago discolor (DC.) Andres-Sanchez & Galbany, comb. nov.; Filago gaditana (Pau) Andres-Sanchez & Galbany, comb. et stat. nov. and Filago griffithii (A. Gray) Andres-Sanchez & Galbany, comb. nov.). The genera Cymbolaena, Evacidium and Evax are synonymised under Filago. Several incongruences found between chloroplast and nuclear DNA sequence analyses, as well as a notable degree of intraspecific sequence variation in all regions sequenced are documented and discussed.

AB Remotely sensed ocean color data and numerical modeling have been used to study the phenology of both spring and fall phytoplankton blooms (FPBs) in the Nova Scotian Shelf (NSS)-Gulf of Maine (GoM) region. The ocean color data reveal a general pattern of westward progression of the spring phytoplankton bloom (SPB), and an eastward progression of the FPB in the NSS-GoM region. The spatial pattern of mean chlorophyll concentration in spring is similar to that in fall, with a lower concentration in the NSS and higher in the GoM. Interannually, there is a weak but significant tendency for years with earlier (delayed) SPBs to be followed by delayed (earlier) FPBs, but the mean chlorophyll concentrations during SPBs are not correlated with those during FPBs. The interannual variability of SPB timing is significantly correlated with sea surface salinity (SSS), but the FPB timing is correlated with both SSS and sea surface temperature. The process-oriented numerical modeling experiments suggest that (i) salinity is the main factor influencing the bloom timing and magnitude in the NSS-GoM region, especially for the timing of SPBs; (ii) compared to buoyancy forcing induced by vertical salinity gradients, the impact of surface heating and surface wind stress on the blooms variability is much weaker; and (iii) the nutrient level controls the bloom magnitude, but only has a minor effect on bloom timing. This study provides a quantitative estimation of relationship between changes in local/remote environmental forcing and phytoplankton phenological shifts, thus improving our understanding on the possible impact of climate change on coastal/shelf ecosystems.

TI Rampant historical mitochondrial genome introgression between two

AB Background: Mitochondrial introgression may result in the mitochondrial genome of one species being replaced by that of another species without leaving any trace of past hybridization in its nuclear genome. Such introgression can confuse the species genealogy estimates and lead to absurd inferences of species history. We used a phylogenetic approach to explore the potential mitochondrial genome introgression event(s) between two closely related green pond frog species, Pelophylax nigromaculatus and P. plancyi.
   Results: DNA sequence data of one mitochondrial and two nuclear genes from an extensive sampling of the two species were collected, and the genealogies of the three genes were constructed and compared. While the two nuclear genes congruently showed mutual reciprocal monophyly of both species, the mitochondrial phylogeny separated a Korean P. nigromaculatus clade, a paraphyletic central China P. plancyi assemblage, and a large well-supported introgression clade. Within the introgression clade, the mitochondrial haplotypes of the two species were mixed together. This reticulated pattern can be most parsimoniously explained by an ancient mitochondrial introgression event from P. plancyi to P. nigromaculatus that occurred at least 1.36 MYA, followed by multiple recent introgression events from P. nigromaculatus back to P. plancyi within the last 0.63 MY. The re-constitution of previously co-adapted genomes in P. plancyi may be responsible for the recent rampant introgression events. The Korean P. nigromaculatus clade likely represents the only surviving "true" mitochondrial lineage of P. nigromaculatus, and the central China P. plancyi assemblage likely represents the "original" P. plancyi mitochondrial lineage. Refugia in the Korean Peninsula and central China may have played a significant role in preserving these ancient lineages.
   Conclusions: The majority of individuals in the two species have either introgressed (P. nigromaculatus) or reclaimed (P. plancyi) mitochondrial genomes while no trace of past hybridization in their nuclear genomes was detected. Asymmetrical reproductive ability of hybrids and continuous backcrossing are likely responsible for the observed mitochondrial introgression. This case is unique in that it includes an ancient "forward" introgression and many recent "backward" introgressions, which re-constitutes the original nuclear and mitochondrial genomes of P. plancyi. This hybrid system provides an excellent opportunity to study cyto-nuclear interaction and co-adaptation.

AB Oceanic islands have been the grand stage of documented extinctions. In view of limited resources, efficient prioritization is crucial to avoid the extinction of taxa. This work lists the top 100 management priority species for the European archipelagos of the Macaronesian region (Azores, Madeira and the Canary Islands), taking into account both their protection priority and their management feasibility. Bryophytes, vascular plants, molluscs, arthropods and vertebrates were scored by species experts following two sets of criteria: (i) protection priority, including ecological value, singularity, public institutions' management responsibilities and social value; (ii) management feasibility, including threats knowledge and control feasibility, external socio-economical support for management and biological recovery potential. Environmental managers weighted the same criteria according to their management importance. Final species scores were determined by the combination of both species valuation and criteria weighting. Vascular plants dominate the Top 100 list, followed by arthropods and vertebrates. The majority of listed taxa are endemic to one archipelago or even to a single island. The management feasibility criteria did not dictate that all taxa must be eminently endangered, as for most of the species it should be relatively easy to control threats. The main advantages of this process are the independent participation of scientists and conservation managers, the inclusion of criteria on both protection priority and management feasibility and the taxonomically unbiased nature of the process. This study provides a potentially useful biodiversity conservation tool for the Macaronesian archipelagos that could be readily implemented by the respective regional governments in future legislation.

AB Tropical rainforests are well known for their extraordinarily high levels of biodiversity. The origin of this species richness is still debated. For instance, the museum hypothesis states that over evolutionary time more and more species will accumulate with relatively few extinctions. In contrast, the Pleistocene diversification model argues that during the last 2 million years, climatic factors (glaciations) caused environmental changes that drove isolation and vicariant speciation events. In this study, we construct a molecular phylogeny of the Sundaland (Malay Peninsula, Sumata, Borneo, Palawan) and Greater Mindanao (Mindanao, Samar, Leyte) tree squirrels (genus Sundasciurus). Our results show that most speciation events in this forest dependent taxon occurred before the Pleistocene and that even the timing of intra-specific splits among populations from different landmasses are relatively old. Additionally, we found unexpectedly high divergence within and between highland populations of S. tenuis on Sumatra and the Malay Peninsula, highlighting the importance of Pliocene events in both speciation and within species divergences in this region.

AB P>The ubiquitous transition of plant communities across slope aspects is a well-described, but rarely tested, ecological dynamic. Aspect position is often used as a proxy for microclimate changes in moisture, light and temperature, but these abiotic drivers are seldom decoupled and very rarely manipulated across slope aspects.
   To investigate the mechanisms and demographic stages driving the observed distribution patterns of two woodland herbs in the southeastern USA, seeds and adults were transplanted across north- and south-facing slopes, and moisture and light were experimentally manipulated.
   Stage- and species-specific abiotic responses resulted in similar landscape-level patterning for Hexastylis arifolia and Hepatica nobilis, but the underlying abiotic drivers were unique. Adult rather than seed survival best explained the natural distributions across slope aspects, and Hexastylis arifolia was limited by higher temperature, whereas Hepatica nobilis was limited by lower soil moisture.
   The stage- and species-specific responses indicated that the use of slope aspect to explain plant distributions not only obfuscates explanatory mechanisms, but probably undermines the portability of results. As abiotic drivers, not topographical proxies, are projected to shift with global climate change, distribution research requires direct abiotic data in association with key demographic stages rather than topographical proxies.

TI Influences of Wildfire, Habitat Size, and Connectivity on Trout in

AB Wildfire is an important natural process in many stream ecosystems, but the ability of fish to respond to wildfire-related disturbances is increasingly constrained by human activities that fragment and degrade stream habitats. In this study, we used molecular genetic markers (nuclear microsatellites) to examine the effects of wildfire and related disturbances along with habitat fragmentation on native rainbow trout in the Boise and Payette River basins, Idaho. We surveyed the genetic diversity of fish in 55 tributary streams to compare the level of diversity in samples without the recent influence of wildfire with that of those influenced by stand-replacing wildfire and those influenced by both wildfire and a severe channel-reorganizing disturbance. Stream habitats also varied substantially in size (catchment basin area) and isolation caused by road culverts. Based on prior work in our study streams, we expected that both wildfire and channel reorganization would reduce local population sizes significantly. Accordingly, we expected that wildfire-related disturbances would reduce genetic diversity via founder effects or population bottlenecks. Our results, however, showed little evidence of these influences. In contrast, the level of genetic diversity was lower in fish collected upstream of culvert barriers, probably because of restricted gene flow. We also observed the expected positive correlation between habitat size and genetic diversity, which suggested the importance of larger local population sizes and habitat diversity in maintaining genetic diversity. An unexpected finding was that 15 of the 55 samples showed genetic evidence of hybridization between rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss and nonnative cutthroat trout O. clarkii. The results of this study suggest that human influences such as barriers to dispersal and introductions of nonnative fish may pose greater threats to populations of native trout than wildfire itself.

AB P>1. Dominant plant functional types (PFTs) are expected to be primary determinants of communities of other above- and below-ground organisms. Here, we report the effects of the experimental removal of different PFTs on arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) communities in a shrubland ecosystem in central Argentina.
   2. On the basis of the biomass-ratio hypothesis and plant resource use strategy theory, we expected the effect of removal of PFTs on AMF colonization and spores to be proportional to the biomass removed and to be stronger when more conservative PFTs were removed. The treatments applied were: undisturbed control (no plant removed), disturbed control (mechanical disturbance), no shrub (removal of deciduous shrubs), no perennial forb (removal of perennial forbs), no graminoid (removal of graminoids) and no annual forb (removal of annual forbs). AMF colonization was assessed after 5, 17 and 29 months. Total density of AMF spores, richness and evenness of morphotaxa, and AMF functional groups were quantified after 5, 17, 29, 36 and 39 months.
   3. Five months after the initial removal we found a significant reduction in total AMF colonization in all plots subjected to PFT removals and in the disturbed control plots, as compared with the undisturbed controls. This effect disappeared afterwards and no subsequent effect on total colonization and colonization by arbuscules was observed. In contrast, a significant increase in colonization by vesicles was observed in months 17 and 29, mainly in no graminoid plots. In general, treatments did not significantly affect AMF spores in the soil. On the other hand, no annual forb promoted transient (12-18 months) higher ammonia availability, and no shrub promoted lower nitrate availability in the longer term (24-28 months).
   4. Synthesis. Our experiment, the first to investigate the effects of the removal of different PFTs on AMF communities in natural ecosystems, indicates that AMF communities are resilient to changes in the soil and in the functional composition of vegetation. Furthermore, it does not provide consistent evidence in support of the biomass-ratio hypothesis or differential trait-based direct or indirect effects of different PFTs on AMF in this particular system.

AB Biodiversity conservation and the identification of conservation units among invertebrates are complicated by low levels of morphological difference, particularly among aquatic taxa. Accordingly, biodiversity is often underestimated in communities of aquatic invertebrates, as revealed by high genetic divergence between cryptic species. We analyzed PCR-amplified portions of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) gene and 165 rRNA gene for amphipods in the Gammarus pecos species complex endemic to springs in the Chihuahuan Desert of southeast New Mexico and west Texas. Our analyses uncover the presence of seven separate species in this complex, of which only three nominal taxa are formally described. The distribution of these species is highly correlated with geography, with many present only in one spring or one spatially-restricted cluster of springs, indicating that each species likely merits protection under the US Endangered Species Act. We present evidence suggesting that habitat fragmentation, long-distance colonization, and isolation-by-distance have occurred at different temporal and spatial scales within this system to produce the lineages that we report. We show that patterns detected in the G. pecos species complex also correlate with endemic fishes (Gambusia spp., pupfish) and hydrobiid snails. Our results provide clues important for future biodiversity investigations in geographically isolated aquatic habitats, and shed light on the understudied and underestimated levels of biodiversity present in desert spring systems.

AB P>1. A number of long-term studies have shown that spring biological events have advanced in recent decades and that this is a response to climate change. In lentic systems, changes in phytoplankton phenology have been attributed to various directly climate-related processes including changes in the onset and duration of thermal stratification, earlier ice-break up and increased water temperature. Both indirect climatic drivers and non-climate drivers such as elevated grazing pressure and nutrient enrichment can also affect phenology.
   2. This study investigated whether phenological trends in phytoplankton could be detected in a relatively short time series in a shallow, ice-free, polymictic lake with a high annual discharge and whether any such trends could be causally explained.
   3. It was found that the centre of gravity of the spring chlorophyll a bloom advanced significantly by 1.6 days per year over a 15-year period. This was accompanied by a significant increase in water temperature of 0.12 degrees C per year which is high compared to published rates of change over longer time series. No direct effects of ice cover, stratification or water discharge rates could be linked to the advancement of the spring bloom. Instead, the shift in timing was attributed to an advance in the timing of the dominant spring diatom, Aulacoseira spp., instigated by a temperature-driven increase in replication rate leading to an earlier onset of silica (SiO2) limitation.

AB Landbridge islands offer unique opportunities for understanding the effects of fragmentation history on genetic variation in island taxa. The formation of islands by rising sea levels can be likened to a population bottleneck whose magnitude and duration is determined by island area and time since isolation, respectively. The Holocene landbridge islands of the Aegean Sea (Greece) were formed since the last glacial maximum and constitute an ideal system for disentangling the effects of island area, age and geographic isolation on genetic variability. Of the many reptile species inhabiting this island system, the Aegean wall lizard Podarcis erhardii is an excellent indicator of fragmentation history due to its widespread distribution and poor over-water dispersal abilities. In this study, we utilize a detailed record of Holocene fragmentation to investigate the effects of island history on wall lizard mitochondrial and nuclear microsatellite diversity. Findings show that the spatial distribution of mitochondrial haplotypes reflects historical patterns of fragmentation rather than geographic proximity per se. In keeping with neutral bottleneck theory, larger and younger islands retain more nuclear genetic variation than smaller, older islands. Conversely, there is no evidence of an effect of isolation by distance or effect of distance to the nearest larger landmass on genetic variability, indicating little gene flow between islands. Lastly, population-specific measures of genetic differentiation are inversely correlated with island area, suggesting that smaller islands exhibit greater divergence due to their greater susceptibility to drift. Taken together, these results suggest that both island area and time since isolation are important predictors of genetic variation and that these patterns likely arose through the progressive fragmentation of ancestral diversity and the ensuing cumulative effects of drift.

AB We conducted two field experiments to explore the reactions of feral ferrets (Mustela furo) to traps and bait dispensers set on pastoral farmland in central North Island, New Zealand. First, in 2004 we showed that only six of 13 radio-collared ferrets resident near four observation stations approached to within 8 m of two stations, and only three of the six entered over 8 days of observation. Five of the 15 ferrets available on the 6000 ha study area eluded recapture, although all remained present. Second, in 2006 we monitored the survival of 23 radio-collared ferrets before, throughout and after a 5-week field experiment, using toxic bait deployed in 20 automated bait dispensers distributed over 2554ha. Eight ferrets entered a bait dispenser: four entered but did not take the bait; two did not visit but were killed by secondary poisoning; and nine never entered a bait dispenser. After the experiment, intensive live trapping guided by repeated radio-location surveys retrieved only two of 13 collared ferrets that were definitely still alive on the study area. Inefficiency of trapping wide-ranging mustelids such as ferrets, stoats (Mustela erminea) and mink (Neovison bison) is probably commonplace, due to lack of opportunity (if animals take longer to find or enter a trap than it remains available) and/or to active avoidance (refusal to enter traps or to take bait). Our results provide confirmed examples of both, and help explain why short-term or seasonal control of invasive mustelids is often very inefficient, and eradication unlikely. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The genus Helichrysum has 500-600 species in Africa, Madagascar, the Mediterranean basin, Macaronesia, western and central Asia, and India. The aims of this study are to confirm the exclusion of Castroviejoa from Helichrysum, to elucidate the origin of the Macaronesian endemics, to confirm the monophyly of the Mediterranean-Asiatic group, and, within this group, to contrast molecular data with sectional classification and to provide insight into trends in character evolution and biogeography. To address these issues, ITS and ETS sequences were used in phylogenetic analyses. Results show that Castroviejoa is excluded from Helichrysum. The phylogeny obtained suggests a southern African origin for Helichrysum and several subsequent migrations throughout the African continent. The species from the Canary Islands do not form a monophyletic clade, suggesting that at least two independent colonization events occurred. Helichrysum makranicum, from Oman and southern Iran, is the closest relative of a clade consisting of two endemics of the Canary Islands, providing new evidence of the phytogeographical links between Macaronesia and eastern Africa-southern Arabia. Helichrysum gossypinum, the third endemic of the Canary Islands, is the sister species of a monophyletic Mediterranean and Asiatic group, with the four endemics of Madeira sister to all of them. Within the Mediterranean-Asiatic clade, sect. Stoechadina is monophyletic, but sect. Helichrysum and sect. Virginea are not. Once in the Mediterranean region, the genus is hypothesized to have diversified and expanded to the east up to western and central Asia and to have suffered a reduction in woodiness.

AB The "fundamental niche'' is the range of conditions under which an organism can survive and reproduce, measured in the absence of biotic interactions. Niche measurements are often based on statistical relationships between species presence and measured environmental variables, or inferred from measured responses of species along hypothesized niche axes. In this study, we use novel, process-based models of how irradiance and gas diffusion influence photosynthesis and respiration to predict niche dimensions for three coral species: Acropora nasuta, Montipora foliosa, and Leptoria phrygia. We use a combination of mathematical modeling, laboratory experiments, and field observations to establish the link between energy acquisition and the dominant environmental gradients on reefs: light intensity and water flow velocity. Our approach allows us to quantify how the shape of the niche varies in response to light and flow conditions. The model predicts that, due to its higher photosynthetic capacity, the branching coral A. nasuta has a positive energy balance over a wider range of conditions than both a massive species ( L. phrygia) and a foliose species ( M. foliosa). Moreover, colony size influences niche width, with larger colonies of all three species achieving a positive energy balance over a broader range of conditions than small colonies. Comparison of model predictions with field data demonstrated that tissue biomass and reproductive output are significantly and positively correlated with predicted energy acquisition. These results show how interactions between light and flow determine organism performance along environmental gradients on coral reefs. In addition, this study demonstrates the utility of process-based models for quantifying how physiology influences ecology, and for predicting the ecological consequences of varying environmental conditions.

AB Natural resource management decisions can be based on incomplete knowledge when they lack scientific research, monitoring, and assessment and/or simultaneously fail to draw on local ecological knowledge. Many community-based forestry organizations in the United States attempt to address these knowledge gaps with an integrated ecological stewardship approach that balances ecological, social, and economic goals. This paper examines the use and integration of local knowledge and conventional science in ecological stewardship and monitoring by seven community-based forestry demonstration projects. Through document reviews and interviews with both participants and partners of all of these community-based organizations, we found that all the community-based forestry groups incorporated local ecological knowledge into many aspects of their management or monitoring activities, such as collaboratively designing monitoring programs with local ranchers, forest workers, and residents; involving local people in collecting data and interpreting results; and documenting the local ecological knowledge of private forest landowners, long-time residents, and harvesters of nontimber forest products. We found that all the groups also used conventional science to design or conduct ecological assessments, monitoring, or research. We also found evidence, in the form of changes in attitudes on the part of local people and conventional scientists and jointly produced reports, that the two types of knowledge were integrated by all groups. These findings imply that community-based forestry groups are redistributing the power of conventional science through the use of diverse knowledge sources. Still, several obstacles prevented some local, traditionally under-represented groups from being significantly involved in monitoring and management decisions, and their knowledge has not yet been consistently incorporated.

AB Treatments with ethylenediurea (EDU) protect plants from ozone foliar injury, but the processes underlying this protection are poorly understood. Adult ash trees (Fraxinus excelsior), with or without foliar ozone symptoms in previous years. were treated with EDU at 450 ppm by gravitational trunk infusion in May-September 2005 (32.5 ppm h AOT40). At 30-day intervals, shoot growth. gas exchange. chlorophyll a fluorescence, and water potential were determined. In September, several biochemical parameters were measured. The protective influence of EDU was supported by enhancement in the number of leaflets. EDU did not contribute its nitrog-en to leaf tissue as a fertiliser, as determined from lack of difference in foliar N between treatments. Both biochemical (increase in ascorbate-peroxidase and ascorbic acid, and decrease in apoplastic hydrogen peroxide) and biophysical (decrease in stomatal conductance) processes regulated EDU action. As total ascorbic acid increased only in the asymptomatic trees. its role in alleviating O-3 effects on leaf growth and visible injury is controversial. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Expanding populations of geese feeding on farmland during winter and spring conflict with agricultural interests along their migratory flyway in north-western Europe. In Mid-Norway, farmers scare spring-staging pink-footed geese Anser brachyrhynchus off their land to protect crops, and this has had clear effects on goose distribution. To protect the geese, Norwegian authorities have implemented economic compensation to farmers to discourage scaring, but this has not been prioritised to accommodate the biological requirements and dispersal patterns of the geese, though such an approach is clearly needed. To address this need, we assessed the negative effects of scaring geese during 2004-2007, and built a species distribution model to identify sites suitable for goose foraging. We subsequently combined known foraging sites with sites identified by our model and prioritised these sites according to their connectivity, perimeter area ratio, years of historic use and proximity to roost. By combining historic data on foraging sites, a species distribution model, and a simple, accountable site selection process we demonstrate how the current compensation scheme can be made 10 times more efficient through strategic prioritisation. Our approach has direct implications for alleviating similar goose-agriculture conflicts throughout Europe. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The floristic diversity of Mexican tropical deciduous forests (TDF) is of critical importance given the high species richness (alpha diversity), species turnover (beta diversity), and the intense deforestation rates. Currently, most TDF landscapes are mosaics of agricultural land, secondary vegetation, and patches of relatively undisturbed primary vegetation. Here we illustrate how both primary forest remnants and secondary vegetation patches contribute to the floristic diversity of TDF in a landscape of volcanic origin in central Veracruz, Mexico. Our objectives were to assess sampling efficiency and inventory completeness, to compare mean and cumulative species richness between primary forest and secondary vegetation sites, and to analyze beta diversity between vegetation types. In an area of 12,300 m(2) we recorded 105 families, 390 genera, and 682 species. Species inventories for both vegetation types were about 80% complete. Secondary vegetation is more alpha diverse than primary forest, both in terms of cumulative and mean species richness. We found a remarkably high beta diversity between vegetation types (75% of complementarity, 91.60% of mean dissimilarity). We also identified the species that contribute the most to similarity within vegetation types and to dissimilarity between vegetation types. Our results support the idea that assessing biodiversity on the landscape scale is an appropriate way to ascertain the impact of human activities. For this land mosaic, conservation of the flora would not be possible by focusing solely on primary forest remnants. We propose the implementation of a network of small conservation areas with a flexible structure, following the "archipelago reserve" model.

AB The relationships between species diversity and ecosystem functions are in the focus of recent ecological research. However, until now the influence of species diversity on ecosystem processes such as decomposition or mineral cycling is not well understood. In deciduous forests, spiders are an integral part of the forest floor food web. In the present study, patterns of spider diversity and community structure are related to diversity of deciduous forest stands in the Hainich National Park (Thuringia). In 2005, pitfall trapping and quantitative forest floor sampling were conducted in nine plots of forest stands with one (Diversity Level 1), three (DL 2) and five (DL 3) major deciduous tree species. Species richness, measured with both methods, as well as spider abundance in forest floor samples were highest in stands with medium diversity (DL 2) and lowest in pure beech stands (DL 1). The Shannon-Wiener index and spider numbers in pitfall traps decreased from DL 1 to DL 3, while the Shannon-Wiener index in forest floor samples increased in the opposite direction. Spider community composition differed more strongly between single plots than between diversity levels. Altogether, no general relationship between increasing tree species diversity and patterns of diversity and abundance in spider communities was found. It appears that there is a strong influence of single tree species dominating a forest stand and modifying structural habitat characteristics such as litter depth and herb cover which are important for ground-living spiders.

AB This paper presents a novel methodology for multi-scale and multi-type spatial data integration in support of insect pest risk/vulnerability assessment in the contiguous United States. Probability of gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar L.) establishment is used as a case study. A neural network facilitates the integration of variables representing dynamic anthropogenic interaction and ecological characteristics. Neural network model (back-propagation network [BPN]) results are compared to logistic regression and multi-criteria evaluation via weighted linear combination, using the receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (AUC) and a simple threshold assessment. The BPN provided the most accurate infestation-forecast predictions producing an AUC of 0.93, followed by multi-criteria evaluation (AUC = 0.92) and logistic regression (AUC = 0.86) when independently validating using post model infestation data. Results suggest that BPN can provide valuable insight into factors contributing to introduction for invasive species whose propagation and establishment requirements are not fully understood. The integration of anthropogenic and ecological variables allowed production of an accurate risk model and provided insight into the impact of human activities. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

AB We examined the genetic structure of snowy plovers (Charadrius alexandrinus) in North America, the Caribbean, and the west coast of South America to quantify variation within and among breeding areas and to test the validity of three previously recognized subspecies. Sequences (676 bp) from domains I and II of the mitochondrial control region were analyzed for 166 snowy plovers from 20 breeding areas. Variation was also examined at 10 microsatellite loci for 144 snowy plovers from 14 breeding areas. The mtDNA and microsatellite data provided strong evidence that the Puerto Rican breeding group is genetically divergent from sites in the continental U.S. (net sequence divergence = 0.38%; F (ST) for microsatellites = 0.190). Our data also revealed high levels of differentiation between sites from South America and North America (net sequence divergence = 0.81%; F (ST) for microsatellites = 0.253). In contrast, there was little genetic structure among breeding sites within the continental U.S. Our results suggest that snowy plovers in Florida should be considered part of C. a. nivosus (rather than part of C. a. tenuirostris, where they are currently placed), whereas snowy plovers from Puerto Rico should be considered part of C. a. tenuirostris. Snowy plovers in South America should remain a separate subspecies (C. a. occidentalis). Although U.S. Pacific and Gulf Coast breeding areas were not genetically distinct from other continental U.S. sites, demographic isolation, unique coastal habitats, and recent population declines suggest they warrant special concern.

AB The recent development of large environmental databases allow the analysis of the ecological behaviour of species or communities over large territories. Solar radiation is a fundamental component of ecological processes, but is poorly used at this scale due to the lack of available data. Here we present a GIS program allowing to calculate solar radiation as well locally as at large scale, taking into account both topographical (slope, aspect, altitude, shadowing) and global (cloudiness and latitude) parameters. This model was applied to the whole of France (540 000 km(2)) for each month of the year, using only a 50-m digital elevation model (DEM), latitude values and cloudiness data. Solar radiation measured from 88 meteorological stations used for validation indicated a R-2 of 0.78 between measured and predicted annual radiation with better predictions for winter than for summer. Radiation values increase with altitude, and with slope for southern exposure, excepted in summer. They decrease with latitude, nebulosity, and slope for north, east, and west exposures. The effect of cloudiness is important, and reduces radiation by around 20% in winter and 10% in summer. Models of plant distribution were calculated for Abies alba, Acer pseudoplatanus, and Quercus pubescens, for France. The use of solar radiation improved modelling for the three species models directly or through the water balance variable. We conclude that models which incorporates both topographical and global variability of solar radiation can improve efficiency of large-scale models of plant distribution.

AB We developed and validated a density-adjusted spatial model to predict moose (Alces alces) highway-crossing probability to see if the model could be used as an index of moose-vehicle collision risk. We installed Global Positioning System telemetry collars on 47 moose in the north of the Laurenticles Wildlife Reserve, Quebec, for 2-36 months. We recorded only 84 highway crossings in spring (0.29% of 28,967 2-hr steps) and 122 crossings in summer (0.18% of 68,337 2-hr steps), despite a high sampling effort and having captured moose close to highways. Moose movement rates during movement steps crossing a highway were on average 3 times higher than during the steps preceding or following highway crossing. Paths used by moose when crossing a highway were characterized by a high proportion of food stands, low proportion of lakes and rivers, and topography typical of a valley. Highway-crossing sites were located in valleys with brackish pools and forest stands providing coniferous cover but a low proportion of lakes and rivers. We adjusted moose crossing probability for local variation in moose density using aerial survey data and assessed crossing probability along the highways in the entire Laurentides Wildlife Reserve. We tested the model using moose-vehicle accident data from 1990 to 2002. The relationship between the density-adjusted crossing probability and number of accidents was relatively loose at the 1-km scale but improved markedly when using longer highway sections (5-15 km; r > 0.80). Our results demonstrate that roads and their surroundings are perceived as low-quality habitat by moose. We also conclude that road segments installed along secondary valleys could be a highly strategic site to deploy mitigation measures such as fences and that it could be desirable to increase the width of road shoulders to reduce forest cover and to eliminate brackish pools to reduce cervid-vehicle collisions. We suggest using empirical data such as location of vehicle wildlife collisions to plan mitigation measures at a fine scale.

AB We investigated the relative roles of natural factors and shoreline harvest leading to recent declines of the black leather chiton (Katharina tunicata) on the outer Kenai Peninsula, Alaska (USA). This intertidal mollusk is a strongly interacting grazer and a culturally important subsistence fishery for Sugpiaq (Chugach Alutiiq) natives. We took multiple approaches to determine causes of decline. Field surveys examined the significant predictors of Katharina density and biomass across 11 sites varying in harvest pressure, and an integrated analysis of archaeological faunal remains, historical records, traditional ecological knowledge, and contemporary subsistence invertebrate landings examined changes in subsistence practices through time. Strong evidence suggests that current spatial variation in Katharina density and biomass is driven by both human exploitation and sea otter (Enhydra lutris) predation. Traditional knowledge, calibrated by subsistence harvest data, further revealed that several benthic marine invertebrates (sea urchin, crab, clams, and cockles) have declined serially beginning in the 1960s, with reduced densities and sizes of Katharina being the most recent. The timing of these declines was coincident with changes in human behavior (from semi-nomadic to increasingly permanent settlement patterns, improved extractive technologies, regional commercial crustacean exploitation, the erosion of culturally based season and size restrictions) and with the reestablishment of sea otters. We propose that a spatial concentration in shoreline collection pressure through time, increased harvest efficiency, and the serial depletion of alternative marine invertebrate prey have led to intensified per capita predator impacts on Katharina and thus its recent localized decline.

AB Despite its ecological importance, broad-scale use of foliar nitrogen as an indicator of ecosystem response to atmospheric N deposition has heretofore been obscured by its poorly understood intrinsic variability through time, space, and across species. We used a regional survey of foliar N conducted within a single growing season to observe that eight of nine major canopy tree species had increased foliar N in response to a gradient of N deposition in the Adirondack Park, New York. These results (1) add important foliar N evidence to support N saturation theory, (2) strongly reinforce the conclusion that N deposition is affecting the N status of forest ecosystems in the northeastern U.S., and (3) extend N saturation theory by identifying that temperate forest canopy species differ in their foliar N response to N deposition. Interestingly, species-specific differences were strongly related to two functional traits that arise from within-leaf allocations of N resources-leaf mass per area (LMA) and shade tolerance. Thus, combining species-specific knowledge of these functional traits with existing foliar N-centered remote sensing and ecosystem modeling approaches may provide a much-needed avenue to make broad-scale assessments of how persistently elevated rates of N deposition will continue to affect temperate forest ecosystems.

AB Intensive and successive field surveys on the relative abundance of Nezara viridula (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae) and N. antennata at various localities in northern Kyushu, Japan, together with scattered collection records of N. viridula in Kyushu and Honshu, clearly showed that N. viridula has been expanding its range northward since the 1960s. The present range of N. viridula in Kyushu coincided well with the areas where the mean temperature of the coldest month exceeds 5 degrees C that has been suggested to be the lowest thermal limit for N. viridula to overwinter successfully. The future range of N. viridula is predicted to cover a large area of Kyushu if the temperature rises by 1.4 to 5.8 degrees C by 2100. In some places, N. antennata seemed to have been replaced by N. viridula as a result of their interspecific mating that prevented N. antennata from intraspecific mating. This is because N. antennata was overwhelmed, in abundance, by N. viridula, which has a higher reproductive potential than N. antennata under warm conditions with a sufficient amount of food resources. Conversely, N. antennata populations recovered in a few places where N. viridula had replaced N. antennata in the 1950s, probably due to the shortage of rice plants on which N. viridula preferably reproduces.

AB Tuatara (Sphenodon spp) populations are restricted to 35 offshore islands in the Hauraki Gulf, Bay of Plenty and Cook Strait of New Zealand. Low levels of genetic variation have previously been revealed by allozyme and mtDNA analyses. In this new study, we show that six polymorphic microsatellite loci display high levels of genetic variation in 14 populations across the geographic range of tuatara. These populations are characterised by disjunct allele frequency spectra with high numbers of private alleles. High F-ST (0.26) values indicate marked population structure and assignment tests allocate 96% of all individuals to their source populations. These genetic data confirm that islands support genetically distinct populations. Principal component analysis and allelic sequence data supplied information about genetic relationships between populations. Low numbers of rare alleles and low allelic richness identified populations with reduced genetic diversity. Little Barrier Island has very low numbers of old tuatara which have retained some relictual diversity. North Brother Island's tuatara population is inbred with fixed alleles at 5 of the 6 loci.

AB Reduced levels of genetic variability and a prominent differentiation in both neutral marker genes and phenotypic traits are typical for many island populations as compared to their mainland conspecifics. However, whether genetic diversity in neutral marker genes reflects genetic variability in quantitative traits, and thus, their evolutionary potential, remains typically unclear. Moreover, the phenotypic differentiation on islands could be attributable to phenotypic plasticity, selection or drift; something which seldom has been tested. Using eight polymorphic microsatellite loci and quantitative genetic breeding experiments we conducted a detailed comparison on genetic variability and differentiation between Nordic islands (viz. Gotland, Oland and L ae so) and neighbouring mainland populations of moor frogs (Rana arvalis). As expected, the neutral variation was generally lower in island than in mainland populations. But as opposed to this, higher levels of additive genetic variation (V (A)) in body size and tibia length were found on the island of Gotland as compared to the mainland population. When comparing the differentiation seen in neutral marker genes (F (ST)) with the differentiation in genes coding quantitative traits (Q (ST)) two different evolutionary scenarios were found: while selection might explain a smaller size of moor frogs on Gotland, the differentiation seen in tibia length could be explained by genetic drift. These results highlight the limited utility of microsatellite loci alone in inferring the causes behind an observed phenotypic differentiation, or in predicting the amount of genetic variation in ecologically important quantitative traits.

AB The funnel-web spider genus Macrothele is the only representative of the mygalomorph family Hexathelidae not found in Australia or New Zealand. Its 26 species occur in Central Africa and the Oriental region. Two Macrothele species are found in Europe: M. cretica Kulczynski, 1903 from Crete, and M. calpeiana (Walckenaer, 1805) type species of the genus and the largest European spider, whose distribution extends across the south-eastern Iberian Peninsula, and in two localities of North Africa. Macrothele calpeiana is the only spider protected under European legislation. The fragmentation and destruction of the cork oak forest, with which M. calpeiana was thought to be closely associated, prompted the inclusion of this species in the Bern Convention. Some authors, however, have challenged this view and consider M. calpeiana to be neither a cork oak forest bioindicator nor an endangered species. By contrast, other observations suggest that the distribution of the species is extremely fragmented and that most local populations should be considered as threatened. In this paper, we examine aspects of the conservation status of M. calpeiana in the light of molecular phylogenetic analyses based on mitochondrial markers of sample specimens from major populations. Our data confirm the fragmented distribution of M. calpeiana and reveal high levels of genetic differentiation across its populations. Local population growth cannot be ruled out, though the lineage as a whole has apparently not undergone population growth. Lineage age estimates suggest that M. calpeiana colonized the Iberian Peninsula during the Messinian salinity crisis and that the current population fragmentation originates from the Pliocene and Pleistocene. We argue that the fragmentation and deep genetic divergence across populations, along with evolutionary singularity and endemicity in one of Europe's main biodiversity hotspots, support the preservation of its legally protected status.

AB 1. Intermittent streams in the semi-arid region of Brazil are distinctive landscape features existing as dry watercourses for most of the time. It has been recognized that the extremes of flooding and total absence of water flow are the principal hydrological characteristics of rivers and streams in this region. This is a consequence of complex climatic patterns that lead to an irregular distribution of the small amount of rainfall and low thermal amplitude. The latter is the main climatic difference between the Brazilian semi-arid region and other semi-arid lands.
   2. The expansion of water resource development has been a threat to the natural flow regime and the ecological integrity of rivers and streams in semi-arid Brazil. Efforts to manage and conserve the natural flow regime of these systems are hampered by limited scientific information on the ecological processes driving their flora and fauna and the responses of biota to the high natural variability in flow regime.
   3. The most important issues in the conservation of streams in semi-arid Brazil are the need for their recognition as important sites of biodiversity and that this diversity is closely associated with natural patterns of flow and the hydrological disturbances. Without the understanding of how the extremes of flooding and drought affect the aquatic fauna, the conservation strategies for Brazilian semi-arid streams and their fauna will not be effective.
   4. Therefore, conservation efforts in semi-arid Brazil must ensure that the processes sustaining biodiversity are maintained at multiple-scale and landscape levels and that the natural integrity of the riparian zone is maintained Copyright (c) 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB To estimate the effect of traffic emissions on the vegetation composition of coniferous forests near to motorways, three transects of 520 m length were studied by analysing vegetation composition, soil parameters and deposition data in the Munich-area, Southern Germany. The detected patterns suggest that motorways have an impact on the vegetation composition in the neighbourhood of roads. Depending on the wind direction, the influences of the motorways reaches up to 230 m on downwind side and up to 80 m on upwind side. The vegetation is mainly affected by the deposition of nitrogen deriving from fuel combustion and by basic substances added to road salt. By monitoring vegetation changes near to motorways, it is possible to estimate the areas where harmful alterations of the ecosystem can be expected. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The relationship of interpopulation genetic divergence and within-population diversity has been studied for many temperate species in Europe, but not for the cold-adapted fauna. Here we present the first European-wide phylogeographical study of an arctic-alpine distribution in invertebrates, focusing on wolf spiders of the Pardosa saltuaria group. One hundred twenty-seven (127) specimens from 14 populations were examined. Within Europe, these populations were distributed among six high mountain ranges and Scandinavia. We sequenced the whole 921 base pair mitochondrial (mt) ND1 gene. The resulting 55 unique haplotypes form three monophyletic phylogroups of deep divergence: a Pyrenean, a Balkan and a 'northern' clade. Genetic distances (3.6-4.0%) between the major clades indicate that the arctic-alpine range disjunction was initiated by vicariance events, which precede the four major Alpine glaciations. However, low divergence and incomplete lineage sorting within the 'northern clade' suggest a late Pleistocene separation of the Alpine, Scandinavian, Carpathian and Sudetian populations. Thus, we provide evidence for a multiglacial origin of arctic-alpine distributions in Europe, i.e. the current disjunction results from range fragmentation in several glacial cycles. The pattern of genetic diversity within populations seems predominantly determined by historical factors, but is modified by contemporary aspects. Overall, diversity and divergence are negatively correlated. We suggest that low diversity values might result from (i) ancient bottlenecking during warm interglacial periods, as seen in the Pyrenees and Balkans; (ii) recent bottlenecking in small modern areas, as seen in the Giant Mountains and Bohemian Forest; and (iii) dispersal bottlenecking in northern Scandinavia.

AB The human polyomavirus BK virus (BKV) is ubiquitous in humans, infecting children asymptomatically. BKV is the only primate polyomavirus that has subtypes (I-IV) distinguishable by immunological reactivity. Nucleotide (nt) variations in a major capsid protein (VP1) gene region (designated the epitope region), probably responsible for antigenic diversity, have been used to classify BKV isolates into subtypes. Here, with all the protein-encoding gene sequences, we attempted to elucidate the evolutionary relationships among 28 BKV isolates belonging to subtypes I, III, and IV (no isolate belonging to subtype II, a minor one, was included). First, using the GTR + Gamma + I model, maximum likelihood trees were reconstructed for individual viral genes as well as for concatenated viral genes. On the resultant trees, the 28 BKV isolates were consistently divided into three clades corresponding to subtypes I, III, and IV, although bootstrap probabilities are not always high. Then we used more sophisticated likelihood models, one of which takes account of codon structure, to elucidate the phylogenetic relationships among BKV subtypes, but the phylogeny of the deep branchings remained ambiguous. Furthermore, the possibility of positive selection in the evolution of BKV was examined using the nonsynonymous/synonymous rate ratio as a measure of selection. An analysis based on entire genes could not detect any strong evidence for positive selection, but that based on the epitope region identified a few sites potentially under positive selection (these sites were among those showing subtype linked polymorphisms).

AB Resource availability is important for biodiversity dynamics and community structure, and might alter biodiversity effects on ecosystem productivity and stability. We independently manipulated nutrient availability and species richness in aquatic algal microcosms. Little effect of species richness on biomass production was detected in either high or low nutrient microcosms. However, relative yield analysis and an additive partitioning method indicated greater complementarity effects in low than in high nutrient microcosms, and the complementarity effect showed no trend through time. The effect of species richness on the temporal variability of community was neutral in nutrient-rich environment, while a stabilizing effect of diversity was found in nutrient-poor environment. During a cold perturbation compensatory growth among species was present only in the nutrient-poor environment, while community biomass was reduced only in the nutrient-rich environment. The responses of community and constituent species to cold perturbation were diversity-independent in each environment. Our results suggest that further investigations are needed into the effect of environmental context on the relationships between biodiversity, ecosystem processes, and ecosystem stability.

AB A substantial and increasing number of reports have documented dramatic changes and continuing declines in Caribbean coral reef communities over the past 2 decades. To date, the majority of disease reports have focused on scleractinian corals, whereas sponge diseases have been less frequently documented. In this study, we describe Aplysina red, band syndrome (ARBS) affecting Caribbean rope sponges of the genus Aplysina observed on shallow reefs in the Bahamas. Visible signs of disease presence included 1 or more rust-colored leading edges, with or without a trailing area of necrotic tissue, such that the lesion forms a contiguous band around part or all of the sponge branch. Microscopic examination of the leading edge of the disease margin indicated that a cyanobacterium was consistently responsible for the coloration. Although the presence of this distinctive coloration was used to characterize the diseased state, it is not yet known whether this cyanobacterium is directly responsible for disease causation. The prevalence of ARBS declined significantly from July to October 2004 before increasing above July levels in January 2005. Transmission studies in the laboratory demonstrated that contact with the leading edge of an active lesion was sufficient to spread ARBS to a previously healthy sponge, suggesting that the etiologic agent, currently undescribed, is contagious. Studies to elucidate the etiologic agent of ARBS are ongoing. Sponges are an essential component of coral reef communities and emerging sponge diseases clearly have the potential to impact benthic community structure on coral reefs.

AB The dynamic nature of habitat patches in rivers is driven primarily by flow regime. Altered hydrology, through river regulation, can limit the size and distribution of slackwater patches; important areas for the development of young fish and for shrimp in lowland rivers. Between late October 2002 and late January 2003, we investigated responses of fish, shrimp and their potential prey to the experimental creation of slackwaters and, conversely, to the experimental creation of flowing patches, by diverting water away from flowing patches and into slackwater patches, respectively. A pre-experimental survey indicated that slackwaters contained many more fish than flowing patches, and fish larvae were flushed out of slackwaters during the construction of flowing patches. Creation of slackwaters resulted in increased abundance of fish and shrimp, with the opposite occurring when slackwaters were changed into flowing patches. Converting slackwaters into flowing patches, and vice versa, altered the species composition of zooplankton and microbenthic assemblages but did not change their densities. Thus, standing crop of potential prey alone could not explain the differences in fish or shrimp abundance found between patch types. We hypothesize that slackwaters primarily act as refuges from current and provide energetic advantages to the young stages of fish and to shrimp. River regulation has the potential to affect the recruitment success of fish and shrimp by affecting the size, arrangement and availability of slackwater patches.

AB The use of molecular genetic markers (MGMs) has become widespread among evolutionary biologists, and the methods of analysis of genetic data improve rapidly, yet an organized framework in which scientists can work is lacking. Elements of molecular evolution are summarized to explain the origin of variation at the DNA level, its measures, and the relationships linking genetic variability to the biological parameters of the studied organisms. MGM are defined by two components: the DNA region(s) screened, and the technique used to reveal its variation. Criteria of choice belong to three categories: (1) the level of variability, (2) the nature of the information (e.g. dominance vs. codominance, ploidy, ... ) which must be determined according to the biological question and (3) some practical criteria which mainly depend on the equipment of the laboratory and experience of the scientist. A three-step procedure is proposed for drawing up MGMs suitable to answer given biological questions, and compiled data are organized to guide the choice at each step: (1) choice, determined by the biological question, of the level of variability and of the criteria of the nature of information, (2) choice of the DNA region and (3) choice of the technique.

AB Black band disease (BBD) of corals is characterized as a pathogenic microbial consortium composed of a wide variety of microorganisms. Together, many of these microorganisms contribute to an active sulfur cycle that produces anoxia and high levels of sulfide adjacent to the coral surface, conditions that are lethal to coral tissue. Sulfate-reducing bacteria, as sulfide producers, are an important component of the sulfur cycle and the black band community. Previous molecular survey studies have shown multiple Desulfovibrio species present in BBD but with limited consistency between bacterial species and infections. In this study we compared 16S rRNA gene sequences of sulfate-reducing bacteria selectively cultured from 6 BBD bands on 4 coral species, Diploria clivosa, D. strigosa, D, labyrinthiformes, and Siderastrea siderea, in the Florida Keys and Dominica. The 16S rRNA gene sequences were obtained through direct sequencing of PCR products or by cloning. A BLAST search revealed that 8 out of 10 cultures sequenced were highly homologous to Desulfovibrio sp. strain TBP-1, a strain originally isolated from marine sediment. Although the remaining 2 sequences were less homologous to Desulfovibrio sp. strain TBP-1, they did not match any other sulfate-reducing (or other) species in GenBank.

AB The brush-tailed rock-wallaby (Petrogale penicillata) is an endangered species in southeastern Australia and many of the remaining populations are declining. The steep rocky habitat and shy nature of the species make it difficult to obtain data on population parameters such as abundance and recruitment. Faecal pellet counts from scat plots are commonly used to monitor population trends but these are imprecise and difficult to relate to absolute population size. We conducted a noninvasive genetic sampling 'mark-recapture' study over a 2-year period to identify individuals from faecal DNA samples and estimate the population size of four brush-tailed rock-wallaby colonies located in Wollemi National Park, New South Wales. Scat plots in rock-wallaby colonies were used as sample collection points for this study. Two separate population estimates were carried out for three of the colonies to determine if we could detect recruitment and changes in population size. We determined that there was one large colony of an estimated 67 individuals (95% confidence interval: 55-91) and three smaller colonies. Monitoring of the smaller colonies also detected possible population size increases in all three. Our results indicate that faecal DNA analysis may be a promising method for estimating and monitoring population trends in this species particularly when used with a traditional field survey method.

AB The ecological niche is the conceptual foundation for the analysis of species distributions. Habitat variables and resources are therefore thought to determine the distribution of a species. However, metapopulation and source-sink models posit that population processes determine the local distribution of a species; metapopulation theory suggests that many suitable patches could be unoccupied and source-sink theory suggests that unsuitable patches could be occupied. We examined whether the distribution of 2 European anurans (tree frog [Hyla arbarea] and natterjack toad [Bufo calamita]) was determined by habitat variables, local population size (as indexed by the number of calling males), or metapopulation characteristics are. We found that the distribution of both species was best predicted by the number of calling males in the previous years. This supports the idea that population processes are more important determinants of distribution than habitat characteristics. We suggest that future distribution models explicitly incorporate population dynamic processes. Our results suggest that there is a threshold number of calling males above which a population is almost certain to persist in the short-term. If more robust population data are not available, such a threshold should be useful for managing threatened anuran species because the number of calling males is easily determined.

AB Global production of Haliotids (abalone) declined more than 60% since the 1960s and continues to decline, indicating a failure to manage these resources sustainably. This paper discusses facets of abalone biology which make sustainable management problematic. Abalone resources are comprised of many small (100s-1000s in) self-recruiting microstocks with highly variable sizes-at-maturity. This causes a mismatch between the scale of management and the scale of component units of stock. This "tyranny of scale" leaves component microstocks vulnerable to the "tragedy of the commons" and resources vulnerable to serial depletion despite apparently rigorous regional scale management. I postulate that beyond abalone, and across a range of spatial scales, unrecognized spatial complexity compromises monitoring, assessment, and management in many fisheries. I suggest that a major challenge for abalone fisheries and the field of fisheries more generally, is to adapt the scale of fisheries monitoring, assessment, and management to the actual scale of component units of stocks, and to mobilize the resources required to adequately address the global needs of a myriad of microstocks. An increased use of territorially based fishing rights and a new class of fisheries practitioners are proposed as part of the answer to this challenge.

AB Cerulean warblers (Dendroica cerulea) have experienced significant declines across their breeding range and presently exist in disjunct populations, largely because of extensive loss and fragmentation of their breeding and wintering habitat. Despite this overall decline, a recent north-eastern expansion of the breeding range has been proposed, and some researchers have suggested that the eastern Ontario population may be acting as a source population maintaining sink populations elsewhere. However, little is known about either the geographic distribution of genetic variation or dispersal in these birds. We assayed variation in five microsatellite loci and a 366 base-pair fragment of the mitochondrial control region among 154 cerulean warblers from five populations throughout the breeding range. No evidence of population genetic structure was found. Assignment tests suggested that six individuals were either inter-population migrants or descendants of recent migrants. The lack of population genetic structure is probably due to a combination of historical association and contemporary dispersal. Population decline does not appear to have reduced genetic variation yet. Overall results suggest that cerulean warblers from Ontario, Illinois, Arkansas and Tennessee should be considered a single genetic management unit for conservation.

AB Aim, Location Tomicus (Coleoptera, Scolytidae) species are some of the principal pests of Eurasian forest and are represented by three coexisting species in Spain, Tomicus piniperda (Linnaeus, 1758), Tomicus destruens (Wollaston, 1865) and Tomicus minor (Harting, 1834). The distribution of two taxa are unknown as they have until recently been considered separate species. Therefore, we model the potential distribution centres and establish the potential distribution limits of Tomicus species in Iberia. We also assess the effectiveness of different models by comparing predicted results with observed data. These results will have application in forest pest management.
   Methods Molecular and morphological techniques were used to identify species from 254 specimens of 81 plots. For each plot, a Geographical Information System was used to extract a set of 14 environmental (one topographic, six climatic) and biotic variables (seven host tree distributions). General Additive Models and Ecological Niche Factor Analysis models are applied for modelling and predicting the potential distribution of the three especies of Tomicus.
   Results The results of both modelling methodologies are in agreement. Tomicus destruens is the predominant species in Spain, living in low and hot areas. Tomicus piniperda occurs in lower frequency and prefers wet and cold areas of north-central Spain. We detected sympatric populations of T. destruens and T. piniperda in Northern coast of Spain, infesting mainly P. pinaster. Tomicus minor is the rarest species, and it occupies a fragmented distribution located in high and wet areas. The remarkable biotic variable is the distribution of P. sylvestris, incorporated into the models of T. destruens and T. piniperda.
   Main conclusions These results indicate that in wet areas of north-central Spain where T. piniperda occurs (and possibly the high altitudes of the southern mountains), T. destruens has a climatic distribution limit. In the northern border of this area, both species overlap their distributions and some co-occurrences were detected. Tomicus minor potentially occurs in high and wet fragmented areas.
