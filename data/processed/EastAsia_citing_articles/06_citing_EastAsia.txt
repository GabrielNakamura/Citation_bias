AB Understanding tropical forest dynamics and planning for their sustainable management require efficient, yet accurate, predictions of the joint dynamics of hundreds of tree species. With increasing information on tropical tree life histories, our predictive understanding is no longer limited by species data but by the ability of existing models to make use of it. Using a demographic forest model, we show that the basal area and compositional changes during forest succession in a neotropical forest can be accurately predicted by representing tropical tree diversity (hundreds of species) with only five functional groups spanning two essential trade-offs-the growth-survival and stature-recruitment trade-offs. This data-driven modeling framework substantially improves our ability to predict consequences of anthropogenic impacts on tropical forests.

AB Soil organic carbon (SOC) is a valuable resource for mediating global climate change and securing food production. Despite an alarming rate of global plant diversity loss, uncertainties concerning the effects of plant diversity on SOC remain, because plant diversity not only stimulates litter inputs via increased productivity, thus enhancing SOC, but also stimulates microbial respiration, thus reducing SOC. By analysing 1001 paired observations of plant mixtures and corresponding monocultures from 121 publications, we show that both SOC content and stock are on average 5 and 8% higher in species mixtures than in monocultures. These positive mixture effects increase over time and are more pronounced in deeper soils. Microbial biomass carbon, an indicator of SOC release and formation, also increases, but the proportion of microbial biomass carbon in SOC is lower in mixtures. Moreover, these species-mixture effects are consistent across forest, grassland, and cropland systems and are independent of background climates. Our results indicate that converting 50% of global forests from mixtures to monocultures would release an average of 2.70 Pg C from soil annually over a period of 20 years: about 30% of global annual fossil-fuel emissions. Our study highlights the importance of plant diversity preservation for the maintenance of soil carbon sequestration in discussions of global climate change policy.

AB Large-diameter, tall-stature, and big-crown trees are the main stand structures of forests, generally contributing a large fraction of aboveground biomass, and hence play an important role in climate change mitigation strategies. Here, we hypothesized that the effects of large-diameter, tall-stature, and big-crown trees overrule the effects of species richness and remaining trees attributes on aboveground biomass in tropical forests (i.e., we term the "big-sized trees hypothesis"). Specifically, we assessed the importance of: (a) the " top 1% big-sized trees effect" relative to species richness; (b) the "99% remaining trees effect" relative to species richness; and (c) the "top 1% big-sized trees effect" relative to the "99% remaining trees effect" and species richness on aboveground biomass. Using environmental factor and forest inventory datasets from 712 tropical forest plots in Hainan Island of southern China, we tested several structural equation models for disentangling the relative effects of big-sized trees, remaining trees attributes, and species richness on aboveground biomass, while considering for the full (indirect effects only) and partial (direct and indirect effects) mediation effects of climatic and soil conditions, as well as interactions between species richness and trees attributes. We found that top 1% big-sized trees attributes strongly increased aboveground biomass (i.e., explained 55%-70% of the accounted variation) compared to species richness (2%-18%) and 99% remaining trees attributes (6%-10%). In addition, species richness increased aboveground biomass indirectly via increasing big-sized trees but via decreasing remaining trees. Hence, we show that the "big-sized trees effect" overrides the effects of remaining trees attributes and species richness on aboveground biomass in tropical forests. This study also indicates that big-sized trees may be more susceptible to atmospheric drought. We argue that the effects of big- sized trees on species richness and aboveground biomass should be tested for better understanding of the ecological mechanisms underlying forest functioning.

AB Climate change refugia in the terrestrial biosphere are areas where species are protected from global environmental change and arise from natural heterogeneity in landscapes and climate. Within the marine realm, ocean acidification, or the global decline in seawater pH, remains a pervasive threat to organisms and ecosystems. Natural variability in seawater carbon dioxide (CO2) chemistry, however, presents an opportunity to identify ocean acidification refugia (OAR) for marine species. Here, we review the literature to examine the impacts of variable CO2 chemistry on biological responses to ocean acidification and develop a framework of definitions and criteria that connects current OAR research to management goals. Under the concept of managing vulnerability, the most likely mechanisms by which OAR can mitigate ocean acidification impacts are by reducing exposure to harmful conditions or enhancing adaptive capacity. While local management options, such as OAR, show some promise, they present unique challenges, and reducing global anthropogenic CO2 emissions must remain a priority.

AB Road salts are altering and mobilizing heavy metals away from roadside soils, potentially into freshwater systems. Despite numerous studies investigating the mobilization of heavy metals by road salts, few studies have investigated (a) the movement rate and fate of heavy metals mobilized by road salts, (b) how road salts alter the bioavailable fraction of heavy metals, and (c) how road salts and heavy metals interact to affect freshwater organisms or human health. In this article, we discuss the consequences of increased concentrations of heavy metals and road salts, examine the mechanisms of heavy-metal mobilization, and highlight areas for future research. Future studies should investigate how metals and road salts alter ecosystem function and ecosystem services in freshwater habitats. Finally, increased research efforts will help assess whether the fate of heavy metals mobilized by road salts increases risks to human health by contaminating drinking water and water used for agriculture.

AB Ammonia oxidation, the primary and rate-limiting step of nitrification, is mediated by both ammonia oxidizing archaea (AOA) and bacteria (AOB). However, the dominant environmental driver of the activity, abundance, diversity and composition of ammonia-oxidizers has not been well understood enough, and the relative contribution of AOA and AOB to nitrification is still under debate. Soils treated with different fertilization regimes in an over 35-year field experiment were collected to explore the variation in function and structure of ammonia-oxidizer communities and corresponding driver. The highest nitrification activity (44.49 mg N kg(-1) soil d(-1)) was found in only organic fertilizer (0) treated soil, whereas the lowest activity (2.81 mg N kg(-1) soil d(-1)) was observed in only mineral fertilizer (NPK) treated soil. Moreover, as 1-octyne was employed to discriminate AOA- and AOB-supported nitrification, AOA dominated (93.53%) the nitrification in the Control soil, while AOB contributed dominantly (84.73 -89.10%) in all of the organic amended soils, and NPK-treated soil showed an almost equal contribution to AOA (45.79%) and AOB (54.21%). Compared with the Control soil, AOA abundance increased in soils with organic and low chemical fertilizer but decreased in only chemically treated soil, whereas the AOB abundance in all fertilized soils was greatly enhanced. The AOA activity was linearly dependent on AOA abundance, whereas the AOB activity was exponentially correlated with AOB abundance. The sequences of AOA and AOB in the Control soil were mostly affiliated with group l.1b thaumarchaeota and genus Nitrosospira clusters 3a.1. Soil treated with NPK increased the abundance of AOA that belonged to group I.1a-associated lineage, whereas more abundant AOB was related to Nitrosospira clusters 3a.2 and 8b. In contrast, the O-treated soil showed more abundant AOB that belonged to Nitrosospira clusters 3b and 8b. As revealed by aggregated boosted tree analysis, the soil ammonium (NH4+) content was identified as the dominant driver of activity and diversity of AOA, and soil pH was considered to be the major influencing factor in abundance and composition of AOA; the AOB composition was mainly affected by soil NHS4+ content, the relative activity and diversity by soil pH, and the relative abundance by soil electrical conductivity (EC). Collectively, different fertilization regimes will result in variations in activity, abundance, diversity and composition of ammonia-oxidizers with distinct drivers. Our research could be helpful to identify better strategies for the mitigation of nitrate production in agricultural soils. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Airborne dust derived from desertification in northern China can be transported to East Asia and other regions, impairing human health and affecting the global climate. This study of northern China dust provides an understanding of the mechanism of dust generation and transportation. The authors used dust storm and climatological data from 129 sites and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) datasets in northern China to analyze spatiotemporal characteristics and determine the main factors controlling dust storms occurring during 1960-2007. Dust storm-prone areas are consistent with the spatial distribution of northern China deserts where the average wind speed (AWS) is more than 2ms 21, the mean annual temperature (MAT) ranges from 58 to 108C, and the mean annual precipitation (MAP) is less than 450 mm. Dust storms commonly occur on spring afternoons in a 3- to 6-h pattern. The three predominant factors that can affect DSF are the maximum wind speed, AWS, and MAT. During 1960-2007, dust storm frequency (DSF) in most regions of northern China fluctuated but had a decreasing trend; this was mainly caused by a gradual reduction in wind speed. The effect of temperature on DSF is complex, as positive and negative correlations exist simultaneously. Temperatures can affect source material (dust, sand, etc.), cyclone activity, and vegetation growth status, which influence the generation of dust storms. NDVI and precipitation are negatively correlated with DSF, but the effect is weak.

AB The Earth's evolutionary history is threatened by species loss in the current sixth mass extinction event in Earth's history. Such extinction events not only eliminate species but also their unique evolutionary histories. Here we review the expected loss of Earth's evolutionary history quantified by phylogenetic diversity (PD) and evolutionary distinctiveness (ED) at risk. Due to the general paucity of data, global evolutionary history losses have been predicted for only a few groups, such as mammals, birds, amphibians, plants, corals and fishes. Among these groups, there is now empirical support that extinction threats are clustered on the phylogeny; however this is not always a sufficient condition to cause higher loss of phylogenetic diversity in comparison to a scenario of random extinctions. Extinctions of the most evolutionarily distinct species and the shape of phylogenetic trees are additional factors that can elevate losses of evolutionary history. Consequently, impacts of species extinctions differ among groups and regions, and even if global losses are low within large groups, losses can be high among subgroups or within some regions. Further, we show that PD and ED are poorly protected by current conservation practices. While evolutionary history can be indirectly protected by current conservation schemes, optimizing its preservation requires integrating phylogenetic indices with those that capture rarity and extinction risk. Measures based on PD and ED could bring solutions to conservation issues, however they are still rarely used in practice, probably because the reasons to protect evolutionary history are not clear for practitioners or due to a lack of data. However, important advances have been made in the availability of phylogenetic trees and methods for their construction, as well as assessments of extinction risk. Some challenges remain, and looking forward, research should prioritize the assessment of expected PD and ED loss for more taxonomic groups and test the assumption that preserving ED and PD also protects rare species and ecosystem services. Such research will be useful to inform and guide the conservation of Earth's biodiversity and the services it provides.

AB Excessive fertilization is common in North China Plain. It is essential to determine the extent to which reduction of nitrogen application rates has little impact on yield and understand its physiological basis. Two seasons of field experiments were conducted in a winter wheat field with three nitrogen (N) fertilization treatments, i.e. N3, traditional N application rates (290 kg N hm(-2)), N2, similar to 65% N application rates of N3 (190 kgN hm(-2)) and N1, similar to 40% N application rates of N3 (110 kg N hm(-2)). Yield (Y) and water use efficiency (WUE) of N2 did not reduce significantly in both seasons despite that the instantaneous net photosynthetic rates (A(n)) and stomatal conductance (g(s)) of N2 were significantly lower than those of N3. Y and WUE of N1 treatment reduced significantly in the second season. The reduction of Y was better indicated by photosynthetic capacity (A(max)) in the grain filling stage (around 48-50 days after the irrigation of reviving stage, Dari 48-50) because the decrease of A(max) in this stage was proportional to Y. The A(max) and apparent quantum efficiency (alpha) of N2 measured on Dari 48-50 were not significantly lower than those of N3, which could be the reason of no significant reduction of Y for N2. Thus, the fertilization amount of N2 (190 kgN hm(-2)) can be applied in this area to keep Y steady for at least two years. Differences of the relationships between A(max) and biological factors among treatments and non-stomatal limitation of photosynthesis were also discussed. These results are important for understanding the mechanisms of yield reduction by reducing N application and provide scientific basis for application of fertigation.

AB Fire is a complex process involving interactions and feedbacks between biological, socioeconomic, and physical drivers across multiple spatial and temporal scales. This complexity limits our ability to incorporate fire into Earth system models and project future fire activity under climate change. Conceptual, empirical, and process models have identified the mechanisms and processes driving fire regimes, and provide a useful basis to consider future fire activity. However, these models generally deal with only one component of fire regimes, fire frequency, and do not incorporate feedbacks between fire, vegetation, and climate. They are thus unable to predict the location, severity or timing of fires, the socioecological impacts of fire regime change, or potential non-linear responses such as biome shifts into alternative stable states. Dynamic modeling experiments may facilitate more thorough investigations of fire-vegetation-climate feedbacks and interactions, but their success will depend on the development of dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs) that more accurately represent biological drivers. This requires improvements in the representation of current vegetation, plant responses to fire, ecological dynamics, and land management to capture the mechanisms behind fire frequency, intensity, and timing. DGVMs with fire modules are promising tools to develop a globally consistent analysis of fire activity, but projecting future fire activity will ultimately require a transdisciplinary synthesis of the biological, atmospheric, and socioeconomic drivers of fire. This is an important goal because fire causes substantial economic disruption and contributes to future climate change through its influence on albedo and the capacity of the biosphere to store carbon.

AB Rapid warming in High Asia is threatening its unique ecosystem and endemic species, especially the endangered snow leopard (Panthera uncia). Snow leopards inhabit the alpine zone between snow line and tree line, which contracts and expands greatly during glacier-interglacial cycles. Here we assess impacts of climate change on global snow leopard habitat from the last glacial maximum (LGM; 21 kyr ago) to the late 21st century. Based on occurrence records of snow leopards collected across all snow leopard range countries from 1983 to 2015, we built a snow leopard habitat model using the maximum entropy algorithm (MaxEnt 3.3.3k). Then we projected this model into LGM, mid-Holocene and 2070. Analysis of snow leopard habitat map from LGM to 2070 indicates that three large patches of stable habitat have persisted from the LGM to present in the Altai, Qilian, and Tian Shan-Pamir-Hindu Kush-Karakoram mountain ranges, and are projected to persist through the late 21st century. These climatically suitable areas account for about 35% of the snow leopard's current extent, are large enough to support viable populations, and should function as refugia for snow leopards to survive through both cold and warm periods. Existence of these refugia is largely due to the unique mountain environment in High Asia, which maintains a relatively constant arid or semi-arid climate. However, habitat loss leading to fragmentation in the Himalaya and Hengduan Mountains, as well as increasing human activities, will present conservation challenges for snow leopards and other sympatric species.

AB Anthropogenic pressures on tropical forests are rapidly intensifying, but our understanding of their implications for biological diversity is still very limited, especially with regard to soil biota, and in particular soil bacterial communities. Here we evaluated bacterial community composition and diversity across a gradient of land use intensity in the eastern Amazon from undisturbed primary forest, through primary forests varyingly disturbed by fire, regenerating secondary forest, pasture, and mechanized agriculture. Soil bacteria were assessed by paired-end Illumina sequencing of 16S rRNA gene fragments (V4 region). The resulting sequences were clustered into operational taxonomic units (OTU) at a 97% similarity threshold. Land use intensification increased the observed bacterial diversity (both OTU richness and community heterogeneity across space) and this effect was strongly associated with changes in soil pH. Moreover, land use intensification and subsequent changes in soil fertility, especially pH, altered the bacterial community composition, with pastures and areas of mechanized agriculture displaying the most contrasting communities in relation to undisturbed primary forest. Together, these results indicate that tropical forest conversion impacts soil bacteria not through loss of diversity, as previously thought, but mainly by imposing marked shifts on bacterial community composition, with unknown yet potentially important implications for ecological functions and services performed by these communities.

ID N-E; JACKKNIFE
AB The linkage disequilibrium method is currently the most widely used single sample estimator of genetic effective population size. The commonly used software packages come with two options, referred to as the parametric and jackknife methods, for computing the associated confidence intervals. However, little is known on the coverage performance of these methods, and the published data suggest there may be some room for improvement. Here, we propose two new methods for generating confidence intervals and compare them with the two in current use through a simulation study. The new confidence interval methods tend to be conservative but outperform the existing methods for generating confidence intervals under certain circumstances, such as those that may be encountered when making estimates using large numbers of single-nucleotide polymorphisms.

AB 1. Root quality is one of the main drivers of fine root decomposition, an important process controlling soil carbon (C) and nutrient cycling in most terrestrial ecosystems. Root quality is defined by chemical and morphological traits, which differ across species and thus communities. This trait variation is assumed to follow a trade-off between resource acquisition and conservation (i.e. the root economics spectrum). To what extent root quality or the economics spectrum influence fine root decomposition rates at the community level remains poorly understood, particularly within the context of land use change.
   2. Changes in land use induce shifts in plant community composition, which also affect root distribution within the soil profile, resulting in changes in root quality. We hypothesize that at the community level, (i) root decomposability is driven by community root functional parameters (i.e. root traits measured at the community level), (ii) changes in root functional parameters among land use types and with soil depth translate into changes in root decomposability.
   3. We collected shallow and deep fine roots (<= 2 mm) from 20 plant communities across contrasting land use types in seven sites world-wide, ranging from agricultural crops to natural forests and determined their decomposition rate in standard conditions. Fine root quality was related to known values of functional parameters for these communities, including specific root length (SRL), carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and lignin concentrations.
   4. A combination of chemical functional parameters (lignin, C and N concentrations) best explained root decomposition rates at the community level, whereas root economics remained a poorer predictor of decomposability rates. Among land use gradients, roots from agricultural and agroforestry communities decomposed faster than roots from forest sites. Across and within plant communities, a consistently greater decomposability in shallow roots was observed. Both land use and depth effects were explained by changes in root chemical traits at the community level.
   5. Synthesis. Our results suggest that the conversion of plant communities from forests to agricultural lands leads to changes in root functional parameters that drastically increase root decomposition rates and may lead to major soil C losses, especially in shallow soil layers.

AB Perennial plants allocate more resources belowground, thus sustaining important ecosystem services. Hence, shifting from annual to perennial crops has been advocated towards a more sustainable agriculture. Nevertheless, wild perennial species have lower seed production than selected annuals, raising the questions of whether there is a fundamental trade-off between reproductive effort and life span, and whether such trade-off can be overcome through selection.
   In order to address these questions and to isolate life span from phylogenetic and environmental factors, we conducted a meta-analysis encompassing c. 3000 congeneric annual/perennial pairs from 28 genera. This meta-analysis is complemented with a minimalist model of long-term productivity in perennial species.
   Perennials allocate more resources belowground and less to seeds than congeneric annuals, independently of selection history. However, existing perennial wheat and rice could achieve yields similar to annuals if they survived three years and each year doubled their biomass, as other perennial grasses do.
   Selected perennial crops maintain the large belowground allocation of wild perennials, and thus can provide desired regulatory ecosystem services. To match the seed yield of annuals, biomass production of perennial grains must be increased to amounts attained by some perennial grasses - if this goal can be met, perennial crops can provide a more sustainable alternative to annuals.

AB Both the 'cascade model' of ecosystem service provision and the Driver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response framework individually contribute to the understanding of human-nature interactions in social-ecological systems (SES). Yet, as several points of criticism show, they are limited analytical tools when it comes to reproducing complex cause-effect relationships in such systems. However, in this paper, we point out that by merging the two models, they can mutually enhance their comprehensiveness and overcome their individual conceptual deficits. Therefore we closed a cycle of ecosystem service provision and societal feedback by rethinking and reassembling the core elements of both models. That way, we established a causal sequence apt to describe the causes of change to SES, their effects and their consequences. Finally, to illustrate its functioning we exemplified and discussed our approach based on a case study conducted in the Alpujarra de la Sierra in southern Spain.

AB Despite high vulnerability, the impact of climate change on Himalayan ecosystem has not been properly investigated, primarily due to the inadequacy of observed data and the complex topography. In this study, we mapped the current vegetation distribution in Kashmir Himalayas from NOAA AVHRR and projected it under A1B SRES, RCP-4.5 and RCP-8.5 climate scenarios using the vegetation dynamics model-IBIS at a spatial resolution of 0.5A degrees. The distribution of vegetation under the changing climate was simulated for the 21st century. Climate change projections from the PRECIS experiment using the HADRM3 model, for the Kashmir region, were validated using the observed climate data from two observatories. Both the observed as well as the projected climate data showed statistically significant trends. IBIS was validated for Kashmir Himalayas by comparing the simulated vegetation distribution with the observed distribution. The baseline simulated scenario of vegetation (1960-1990), showed 87.15 % agreement with the observed vegetation distribution, thereby increasing the credibility of the projected vegetation distribution under the changing climate over the region. According to the model projections, grasslands and tropical deciduous forests in the region would be severely affected while as savannah, shrubland, temperate evergreen broadleaf forest, boreal evergreen forest and mixed forest types would colonize the area currently under the cold desert/rock/ice land cover types. The model predicted that a substantial area of land, presently under the permanent snow and ice cover, would disappear by the end of the century which might severely impact stream flows, agriculture productivity and biodiversity in the region.

AB Background: The amphipod and microsporidian diversity in freshwaters of a heterogeneous urban region in Germany was assessed. Indigenous and non-indigenous host species provide an ideal framework to test general hypotheses on potentially new host-parasite interactions, parasite spillback and spillover in recently invaded urban freshwater communities.
   Methods: Amphipods were sampled in 17 smaller and larger streams belonging to catchments of the four major rivers in the Ruhr Metropolis (Emscher, Lippe, Ruhr, Rhine), including sites invaded and not invaded by non-indigenous amphipods. Species were identified morphologically (hosts only) and via DNA barcoding (hosts and parasites). Prevalence was obtained by newly designed parasite-specific PCR assays.
   Results: Three indigenous and five non-indigenous amphipod species were detected. Gammarus pulex was further distinguished into three clades (C, D and E) and G. fossarum more precisely identified as type B. Ten microsporidian lineages were detected, including two new isolates (designated as Microsporidium sp. nov. RR1 and RR2). All microsporidians occurred in at least two different host clades or species. Seven genetically distinct microsporidians were present in non-invaded populations, six of those were also found in invaded assemblages. Only Cucumispora dikerogammari and Dictyocoela berillonum can be unambiguously considered as non-indigenous co-introduced parasites. Both were rare and were not observed in indigenous hosts. Overall, microsporidian prevalence ranged from 50 % (in G. roeselii and G. pulex C) to 73 % (G. fossarum) in indigenous and from 10 % (Dikerogammarus villosus) to 100 % (Echinogammarus trichiatus) in non-indigenous amphipods. The most common microsporidians belonged to the Dictyocoela duebenum-/D. muelleri-complex, found in both indigenous and non-indigenous hosts. Some haplotype clades were inclusive for a certain host lineage.
   Conclusions: The Ruhr Metropolis harbours a high diversity of indigenous and non-indigenous amphipod and microsporidian species, and we found indications for an exchange of parasites between indigenous and non-indigenous hosts. No introduced microsporidians were found in indigenous hosts and prevalence of indigenous parasites in non-indigenous hosts was generally low. Therefore, no indication for parasite spillover or spillback was found. We conclude that non-indigenous microsporidians constitute only a minimal threat to the native amphipod fauna. However, this might change e.g. if C. dikerogammari adapts to indigenous amphipod species or if other hosts and parasites invade.

Species variation in growth and survival rates across ontogeny, represented by tree size classes and life history stage-specific niche partitioning, are potentially important mechanisms for promoting forest diversity. However, the role of ontogeny in mediating competitive dynamics and promoting functional diversity is not well understood, particular in high-diversity systems such as tropical forests. The interaction between interspecific functional trait variation and ontogenetic shifts in competitive dynamics may yield insights into the ecophysiological mechanisms promoting community diversity. We investigated how functional trait (seed size, maximum height, SLA, leaf N, and wood density) associations with growth, survival, and response to competing neighbors differ among seedlings and two size classes of trees in a subtropical rain forest in Puerto Rico. We used a hierarchical Bayes model of diameter growth and survival to infer trait relationships with ontogenetic change in competitive dynamics. Traits were more strongly associated with average growth and survival than with neighborhood interactions, and were highly consistent across ontogeny for most traits. The associations between trait values and tree responses to crowding by neighbors showed significant shifts as trees grew. Large trees exhibited greater growth as the difference in species trait values among neighbors increased, suggesting trait-associated niche partitioning was important for the largest size class. Our results identify potential axes of niche partitioning and performance-equalizing functional trade-offs across ontogeny, promoting species coexistence in this diverse forest community.

AB Neonicotinoids are commonly used seed treatments on Canada's major prairie crops. Transported via surface and subsurface runoff into wetlands, their ultimate aquatic fate remains largely unknown. Biotic and abiotic wetland characteristics likely affect neonicotinoid presence and environmental persistence, but concentrations vary widely between wetlands that appear ecologically (e.g., plant composition) and physically (e.g., depth) similar for reasons that remain unclear. We conducted intensive surveys of 238 wetlands, and documented 59 wetland (e.g., dominant plant species) and landscape (e.g., surrounding crop) characteristics as part of a novel rapid wetland assessment system. We used boosted regression tree (BRT) analysis to predict both probability of neonicotinoid analytical detection and concentration. BRT models effectively predicted the deviance in neonicotinoid detection (62.4%) and concentration (74.7%) from 21 and 23 variables, respectively. Detection was best explained by shallow marsh plant species identity (34.8%) and surrounding crop (13.9%). Neonicotinoid concentration was best explained by shallow marsh plant species identity (14.9%) and wetland depth (14.2%). Our research revealed that plant composition is a key indicator and/or driver of neonicotinoid presence and concentration in Prairie wetlands. We recommend wetland buffers consisting of diverse native vegetation be retained or restored to minimize neonicotinoid transport and retention in wetlands, thereby limiting their potential effects on wetland-dependent organisms.

AB AimIsolation by distance (IBD) analyses are an effective tool for determining genetic connectivity among populations, providing a basis for estimating dispersal and thus contributing to spatial biodiversity planning. Here, we use an IBD approach to determine patterns of connectivity to infer dispersal distances for a phylogenetically diverse range of marine species.
   LocationTwo thousand and eight hundred kilometre of South African coastline.
   MethodsmtDNA data sets for 11 rocky shore and reef-dwelling marine species with diverse life history strategies (broadcast spawning, brooding and live-bearing) were used to quantify intraspecific genetic connectivity by means of global and pairwise (st). Mantel tests were used to assess the significance of genetic structure with geographic distance. Significant, positive slopes were used to estimate dispersal distances. For all species, we also plotted genetic diversity along the coast and compared this to patterns of species richness.
   ResultsFor seven of the 11 species tested, we report positive IBD relationships, with patterns of IBD of similar magnitude in broadcast spawners and live-bearers. Dispersal estimates were low, with effective distances of <10km per generation. We find discordance between pelagic larval development and population structure and that genetic structure and the physio-geographic features of the coastline considered to be important biogeographic barriers do not overlap. Genetic diversity and species richness show congruent patterns, with both variables lowest on the west coast, and increasing towards the east.
   Main conclusionsOur study highlights the complexity of marine systems and the clear need for regional assessments of connectivity, rather than more general management plans which may not otherwise effectively encompass area-specific conservation needs. Importantly, we show that the current marine protected area (MPA) network in South Africa is not effective in protecting evolutionary processes and strongly recommend a network of more closely spaced MPAs in the region that reflects the low average connectivity between distant marine populations.

AB Sociospatial information is critical to marine and coastal ecosystem management. The Hawaii Coastal Uses Mapping Project used a participatory geographic information systems (PGIS) methodology to gather local knowledge regarding the location and intensity of coastal human activities in Hawaii's priority sites for coral reef management. PGIS provided an efficient and effective means of obtaining information in a data-poor context, particularly at a scale and location where considerable local knowledge is held by community members and resource users. We detail the PGIS methods developed to collect sociospatial data on human uses in the project regions and discuss important considerations regarding the practice of PGIS that emerged from the mapping process, as well as implications for the production and documentation of spatial knowledge. Key themes include: issues of scale and appropriateness in using PGIS as a method for mapping human coastal and marine activities; data validity, authority, and the nature of local knowledge; community trust, engagement, and collaboration; and utility for coral reef management. While several factors limit local agencies' ability to use this spatial information to date, natural resource managers found the participatory mapping process to be highly valuable for stakeholder identification and engagement, and the maps provide a resource to state and federal managers to better understand the human implications of future management scenarios.

AB Plant-plant interactions influence how forests cope with climate and contribute to modulate species response to future climate scenarios. We analysed the functional relationships between growth, climate and competition for Pinus sylvestris, Quercus pyrenaica and Quercus faginea to investigate how stand competition modifies forest sensitivity to climate and simulated how annual growth rates of these species with different drought tolerance would change throughout the 21st century. Dendroecological data from stands subjected to thinning were modelled using a novel multiplicative nonlinear approach to overcome biases related to the general assumption of a linear relationship between covariates and to better mimic the biological relationships involved. Growth always decreased exponentially with increasing competition, which explained more growth variability than climate in Q. faginea and P. sylvestris. The effect of precipitation was asymptotic in all cases, while the relationship between growth and temperature reached an optimum after which growth declined with warmer temperatures. Our growth projections indicate that the less drought-tolerant P. sylvestris would be more negatively affected by climate change than the studied sub-Mediterranean oaks. Q. faginea and P. sylvestris mean growth would decrease under all the climate change scenarios assessed. However, P. sylvestris growth would decline regardless of the competition level, whereas this decrease would be offset by reduced competition in Q. faginea. Conversely, Q. pyrenaica growth would remain similar to current rates, except for the warmest scenario. Our models shed light on the nature of the species-specific interaction between climate and competition and yield important implications for management. Assuming that individual growth is directly related to tree performance, trees under low competition would better withstand the warmer conditions predicted under climate change scenarios but in a variable manner depending on the species. Thinning following an exponential rule may be desirable to ensure long-term conservation of high-density Mediterranean woodlands, particularly in drought-limited sites.

AB The impacts of climate change on fires are expected to be highly variable spatially and temporally. In heavily anthropized landscapes, the great number of factors affecting fire regimes further limits our ability to predict future fire activity caused by climate. To address this, we develop a new framework for analysing regional changes in fire regimes from specific spatiotemporal patterns of fires and climate, so-called pyroclimates. We aim to test the trends of fire activity and climate (1973-2009) across the Mediterranean and mountain ecosystems of south-eastern France, and to define the spatial distribution of pyroclimates. Stepwise-PCA and cluster analyses reveal that three pyroclimates capture the spatiotemporal patterns associated with fire regime and climatic conditions. Trend tests indicate a high significant increase in spring temperature and fire weather severity for most of the study area. In contrast, a general decreasing pattern of fire activity is observed since the early 1990s, specifically during summer in historically burned regions. However, winter and spring fires are becoming more frequent and extensive in less fire-prone mountains. Cross-correlation analyses indicate that inter-annual variations in extreme fire weather and fire activity were highly correlated. However, the intensity of relationships is pyroclimate-dependent. Our findings reveal that fire-climate relationships changed rapidly over space and time, presumably according to regional changes in land-use and fire policy. Assessing pyroclimates offers new perspectives for fire management and policy by delineating homogeneous zones with respect to fire, climate and their recent trends, and by revealing geographic contrasts in the underlying fire drivers.

AB Small mammals (Rodentia, Soricomorpha and Erinaceomorpha) play a crucial ecological role for their distribution and importance in food chains, as well as for being considered environmental bioindicators. Thus, they represent excellent models for understanding the evolutionary processes of ecosystems, population dynamics under changing environmental conditions, and habitat vulnerabilities. However, some rodents may help the spread of human diseases and are responsible for impacts on agriculture, forestry, and ecosystems. Consequently, small mammal species are often neglected in conservation biology, and only a few of them are protected according to national and European laws and directives. In this work, we summarize open questions related to Italian small mammals and analyze conservation issues linked to these species. We address research, management and conservation priorities by considering ongoing activities and the novelties as regards the taxonomy and zoogeography. In Italy, 39 native species, including four out of six Italian endemic mammal species and one questioned as native, and 10 alien species are currently included within the category "small mammals" Although several studies revealed that small mammals may be heavily impacted by habitat loss and fragmentation as well as forest management, only three rodents are listed in IUCN red list as "Near Threatened", the remaining being "Least Concern". We suggest that this may be due to the fact that pertinent information, is not translated in assessments in line with those of other taxonomic groups (e.g. bats). Conservation strategies are still inadequate, impacts of alien species still partly unknown or neglected. Thus, wide monitoring projects, ecological studies and general public involvement in conservation effort should be implemented, with the aim to amend national legislation, thus providing native small mammals with adequate protection status.

AB Nitrification plays a central role in global nitrogen cycle, which is affected by interaction between soil microfauna and microorganisms. The impact of synchronized changes in nematodes and ammonia oxidizers within aggregate fractions on nitrification was investigated in an acid soil under 10-year manure application. Nematodes, ammonia oxidizers and potential nitrification activity (PNA) were examined in three soil aggregate fractions under four fertilization regimes. Pyrosequencing data revealed that the dominant bacterial amoA operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were related to Nitrosospira species, while archaeal OTUs were affiliated with Nitrososphaera and Nitrosotalea species. PNA was more strongly correlated with ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) abundance than ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) abundance, although AOA were dominant in the acid soil. Plant parasites had a negative effect on AOB abundance; however, bacterivores stimulated AOB abundance and contributed more to PNA than plant parasites. Aggregate fractions exerted significant impacts on AOA abundance and AOB community composition. Total carbon content strongly affected the abundance and composition of AOA community, while soil pH primarily affected that of AOB community. Soil variables explained 62.7% and 58.1% variations, and nematode variables explained 11.7% and 19.5% variations in the AOA and AOB community composition respectively.

AB The genetic structure of a species is shaped by the interaction of contemporary and historical factors. Analyses of individuals from the same population sampled at different points in time can help to disentangle the effects of current and historical forces and facilitate the understanding of the forces driving the differentiation of populations. The use of such time series allows for the exploration of changes at the population and intraspecific levels over time. Material from museum collections plays a key role in understanding and evaluating observed population structures, especially if large numbers of individuals have been sampled from the same locations at multiple time points. In these cases, changes in population structure can be assessed empirically. The development of new molecular markers relying on short DNA fragments (such as microsatellites or single nucleotide polymorphisms) allows for the analysis of long-preserved and partially degraded samples. Recently developed techniques to construct genome libraries with a reduced complexity and next generation sequencing and their associated analysis pipelines have the potential to facilitate marker development and genotyping in non-model species. In this review, we discuss the problems with sampling and available marker systems for historical specimens and demonstrate that temporal comparative studies are crucial for the estimation of important population genetic parameters and to measure empirically the effects of recent habitat alteration. While many of these analyses can be performed with samples taken at a single point in time, the measurements are more robust if multiple points in time are studied. Furthermore, examining the effects of habitat alteration, population declines, and population bottlenecks is only possible if samples before and after the respective events are included.

AB Understanding the factors that contribute to loss of genetic diversity in fragmented populations is crucial for conservation measurements. Land-bridge archipelagoes offer ideal model systems for identifying the long-term effects of these factors on genetic variations in wild populations. In this study, we used nine microsatellite markers to quantify genetic diversity and differentiation of 810 pond frogs (Pelophylax nigromaculatus) from 24 islands of the Zhoushan Archipelago and three sites on nearby mainland China and estimated the effects of the island area, population size, time since island isolation, distance to the mainland and distance to the nearest larger island on reduced genetic diversity of insular populations. The mainland populations displayed higher genetic diversity than insular populations. Genetic differentiations and no obvious gene flow were detected among the frog populations on the islands. Hierarchical partitioning analysis showed that only time since island isolation (square-root-transformed) and population size (log-transformed) significantly contributed to insular genetic diversity. These results suggest that decreased genetic diversity and genetic differentiations among insular populations may have been caused by random genetic drift following isolation by rising sea levels during the Holocene. The results provide strong evidence for a relationship between retained genetic diversity and population size and time since island isolation for pond frogs on the islands, consistent with the prediction of the neutral theory for finite populations. Our study highlights the importance of the size and estimated isolation time of populations in understanding the mechanisms of genetic diversity loss and differentiation in fragmented wild populations.

AB AimTo quantify the relative importance of propagule pressure, climate-matching and host availability for the invasion of agricultural pest arthropods in Europe and to forecast newly emerging pest species and European areas with the highest risk of arthropod invasion under current climate and a future climate scenario (A1F1).
   LocationEurope.
   MethodsWe quantified propagule pressure, climate-matching and host availability by aggregating large global databases for trade, European arthropod interceptions, Koeppen-Geiger world climate classification (including the A1F1 climate change scenario until 2100) and host plant distributions for 118 quarantine arthropod species.
   ResultsAs expected, all the three factors, propagule pressure, climate suitability and host availability, significantly explained quarantine arthropod invasions in Europe, but the propagule pressure only had a positive effect on invasion success when considered together with climate suitability and host availability. Climate change according to the A1F1 scenario generally increased the climate suitability of north-eastern European countries and reduced the climate suitability of central European countries for pest arthropod invasions.
   Main conclusionsTo our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that propagule pressure interacts with other factors to drive invasions and is not alone sufficient to explain arthropod establishment patterns. European countries with more suitable climate and large agricultural areas of suitable host plants for pest arthropods should thus be more vigilant about introduction pathways. Moreover, efforts to reduce the propagule pressure, such as preventing pests from entering pathways and strengthening border controls, will become more important in north-eastern Europe in the future as the climate becomes more favourable to arthropod invasions.

AB The extent to which climate change might diminish the efficacy of protected areas is one of the most pressing conservation questions. Many projections suggest that climate-driven species distribution shifts will leave protected areas impoverished and species inadequately protected while other evidence suggests that intact ecosystems within protected areas will be resilient to change. Here, we tackle this problem empirically. We show how recent changes in distribution of 139 Tanzanian savannah bird species are linked to climate change, protected area status and land degradation. We provide the first evidence of climate-driven range shifts for an African bird community. Our results suggest that the continued maintenance of existing protected areas is an appropriate conservation response to the challenge of climate and environmental change.

AB Beneficial effects of aluminum (Al) on plant growth have been reported for plant species adapted to acid soils. However, mechanisms underlying the stimulatory effect of Al have not been fully elucidated. The aim of this study was to determine the possible contribution of photosynthesis, antioxidative defense, and the metabolism of both nitrogen and phenolics to the Al-induced growth stimulation in tea (Camellia sinensis [L.] Kuntze) plants. In hydroponics, shoot growth achieved its maximum at 50 M Al suply (24 M Al3+ activity). A more than threefold increase of root biomass was observed for plants supplied with 300 M Al (125 M Al3+ activity). Total root length was positively related to root Al concentrations (r = 0.98). Chlorophyll a and carotenoid concentrations and net assimilation rates were considerably enhanced by Al supply in the young but not in the old leaves. Activity of nitrate reductase was not influenced by Al. Higher concentrations of soluble nitrogen compounds (nitrate, nitrite, amino acids) and reduction of protein concentrations suggest Al-induced protein degradation. This occurred concomitantly with enhanced net CO2-assimilation rates and carbohydrate concentrations. Aluminum treatments activated antioxidant defense enzymes and increased free proline content. Lowering of malondialdehyde concentrations by Al supply indicates that membrane integrity was not impaired by Al. Leaves and roots of Al-treated plants had considerably lower phenolic and lignin concentrations in the cell walls, but a higher proportion of soluble phenolics. In conclusion, Al-induced growth stimulation in tea plants was mediated by higher photosynthesis rate and increased antioxidant defense. Additionally, greater root surface area may improve water and nutrient uptake by the plants.

AB This study presents a comprehensive genetic analysis of stock structure for leatherback turtles (Dermochelys coriacea), combining 17 microsatellite loci and 763 bp of the mtDNA control region. Recently discovered eastern Atlantic nesting populations of this critically endangered species were absent in a previous survey that found little ocean-wide mtDNA variation. We added rookeries in West Africa and Brazil and generated longer sequences for previously analyzed samples. A total of 1,417 individuals were sampled from nine nesting sites in the Atlantic and SW Indian Ocean. We detected additional mtDNA variation with the longer sequences, identifying ten polymorphic sites that resolved a total of ten haplotypes, including three new variants of haplotypes previously described by shorter sequences. Population differentiation was substantial between all but two adjacent rookery pairs, and F (ST) values ranged from 0.034 to 0.676 and 0.004 to 0.205 for mtDNA and microsatellite data respectively, suggesting that male-mediated gene flow is not as widespread as previously assumed. We detected weak (F (ST) = 0.008 and 0.006) but significant differentiation with microsatellites between the two population pairs that were indistinguishable with mtDNA data. POWSIM analysis showed that our mtDNA marker had very low statistical power to detect weak structure (F (ST) < 0.005), while our microsatellite marker array had high power. We conclude that the weak differentiation detected with microsatellites reflects a fine scale level of demographic independence that warrants recognition, and that all nine of the nesting colonies should be considered as demographically independent populations for conservation. Our findings illustrate the importance of evaluating the power of specific genetic markers to detect structure in order to correctly identify the appropriate population units to conserve.

AB Bioclimatic models predict large reductions in native trout across the Rocky Mountains in the 21st century but lack details about how changes will occur. Through five case histories across the region, we explore how a changing climate has been affecting streams and the potential consequences for trout. Monitoring records show trends in temperature and hydrographs consistent with a warming climate in recent decades. Biological implications include upstream shifts in thermal habitats, risk of egg scour, increased wildfire disturbances, and declining summer habitat volumes. The importance of these factors depends on the context, but temperature increases are most relevant where population boundaries are mediated by thermal constraints. Summer flow declines and wildfires will be important where trout populations are fragmented and constrained to small refugia. A critical information gap is evidence documenting how populations are adjusting to long-term habitat trends, so biological monitoring is a priority. Biological, temperature, and discharge data from monitoring networks could be used to develop accurate vulnerability assessments that provide information regarding where conservation actions would best improve population resilience. Even with better information, future uncertainties will remain large due to unknowns regarding Earth's ultimate warming trajectory and how effects translate across scales. Maintaining or increasing the size of habitats could provide a buffer against these uncertainties.

TI Correlations among leaf traits provide a significant constraint on the
   estimate of global gross primary production

AB Current estimates of gross primary productivity (GPP) of the terrestrial biosphere vary widely, from 100 to 175 Gt C year(-1). Ecosystem GPP cannot be measured directly, and is commonly estimated using models. Among the many parameters in those models, three leaf parameters have strong influences on the modelled GPP: leaf mass per area, leaf lifespan and leaf nitrogen concentration. The first two parameters affect the modelled canopy leaf area and the last two determine the maximal leaf photosynthetic rate. Ecological studies have firmly established that these three parameters are significantly correlated at regional to global scales, but this knowledge is yet to be used in predicting global GPP. We hypothesize that incorporating multi-trait covariance can reduce uncertainties of model predictions in a way likely to provide improved realism. Using the Australian community land surface model (CABLE), we find that correlations among these three parameters reduce the variance among GPP estimates by CABLE by over 20% for shrub, C4 grassland and tundra, and by between 5% and 20% for most other PFTs, as compared with the simulated GPP without considering the correlations. Globally the correlations do not alter the mean but reduce the variance of modeled GPP by CABLE by 28% and result in fewer extremely high or extremely low (and unlikely) global GPP predictions. Therefore correlations among the three leaf parameters, and possibly other parameters, can be used as a significant constraint on the estimates of model parameters or predictions by those models.

AB Ecologists are increasingly aware of the importance of environmental variability in natural systems. Climate change is affecting both the mean and the variability in weather and, in particular, the effect of changes in variability is poorly understood. Organisms are subject to selection imposed by both the mean and the range of environmental variation experienced by their ancestors. Changes in the variability in a critical environmental factor may therefore have consequences for vital rates and population dynamics. Here, we examine =90-year trends in different components of climate (precipitation mean and coefficient of variation (CV); temperature mean, seasonal amplitude and residual variance) and consider the effects of these components on survival and recruitment in a population of Eurasian beavers (n similar to=similar to 242) over 13 recent years. Within climatic data, no trends in precipitation were detected, but trends in all components of temperature were observed, with mean and residual variance increasing and seasonal amplitude decreasing over time. A higher survival rate was linked (in order of influence based on Akaike weights) to lower precipitation CV (kits, juveniles and dominant adults), lower residual variance of temperature (dominant adults) and lower mean precipitation (kits and juveniles). No significant effects were found on the survival of nondominant adults, although the sample size for this category was low. Greater recruitment was linked (in order of influence) to higher seasonal amplitude of temperature, lower mean precipitation, lower residual variance in temperature and higher precipitation CV. Both climate means and variance, thus proved significant to population dynamics; although, overall, components describing variance were more influential than those describing mean values. That environmental variation proves significant to a generalist, wide-ranging species, at the slow end of the slow-fast continuum of life histories, has broad implications for population regulation and the evolution of life histories.

AB After release to the wild, captive reared salmon have shown lower foraging rates on natural prey and impaired ability to avoid natural predators and thus lower survival compared with wild-born conspecifics. Here, we examine whether captive breeding influences learning of foraging on natural prey and how enriched rearing methods may improve foraging on natural prey by Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) parr. We reared offspring of hatchery or wild salmon of the same population in either a standard or enriched environment at production-scale densities. The enriched environment featured submerged overhead shelter, varying water current, depth and direction and consequently alterations in food dispersion. Parr reared in the enriched environment expressed higher feeding rates, and parr of wild origin started to forage earlier on natural prey. The enriched method promoted foraging of hatchery reared parr on natural prey and is easily applicable to commercial production of salmonids for reintroduction or stock enhancement purposes.

AB One of the major tenets of the modern synthesis is that genetic differentiation among subpopulations is translated over time into genetic differentiation among species. Phylogeographic exploration is therefore essential to the study of speciation because it can reveal the presence of subpopulations that may go on to become species or that may already represent cryptic species. Acoustic species-specific mating signals provide a significant advantage for the recognition of cryptic or incipient species. Because the majority of species do not have such easily recognized premating signals, data from acoustically signaling species can serve as a valuable heuristic tool. Acoustic signals are also convenient tools for recognizing hybridization events. Here, we demonstrate that evidence of hybridization in the form of intermediate song phenotypes is present in many contact zones between species of the New Zealand grass cicadas of the Kikihia muta species complex and that recurring mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) introgression has created misleading patterns that make it difficult to identify certain taxa using song or mtDNA alone. In one case, introgression appears to have occurred between allopatric taxa by dispersal of introgressed populations of an intermediary species ("hybridization by proxy"). We also present a comparison of mtDNA-tree- and song-based taxonomies obtained for the K. muta complex. We find that 12 mtDNA candidate species are identified using shifts in phylogenetic branching rate found by a single-threshold mixed Yule-coalescent lineage model, while only 7 candidate species are identified using songs. Results from the Yule-coalescent model are dependent on factors such as the number of modeled thresholds and the inclusion of duplicate haplotypes. Genetic distances within song species reach a maximum at about 0.028 substitutions/site when likely cases of hybridization and introgression are excluded. Large genetic breaks or "gaps" are not observed between some northern (warmer climate) song clades, possibly because climate-induced bottlenecks have been less severe. These results support ongoing calls for multimarker genetic studies as well as "integrative taxonomy" that combines information from multiple character sources, including behavior, ecology, geography, and morphology.

AB Species distribution models are an important tool to predict the impact of global change on species distributional ranges and community assemblages. Although considerable progress has been made in the statistical modeling during the last decade, many approaches still ignore important features of species distributions, such as nonlinearity and interactions between predictors, spatial autocorrelation, and nonstationarity, or at most incorporate only some of these features. Ecologists, however, require a modeling framework that simultaneously addresses all these features flexibly and consistently. Here we describe such an approach that allows the estimation of the global effects of environmental variables in addition to local components dealing with spatiotemporal autocorrelation as well as nonstationary effects. The local components can be used to infer unknown spatiotemporal processes; the global component describes how the species is influenced by the environment and can be used for predictions, allowing the fitting of many well-known regression relationships, ranging from simple linear models to complex decision trees or from additive models to models inspired by machine learning procedures. The reliability of spatiotemporal predictions can be qualitatively predicted by separately evaluating the importance of local and global effects. We demonstrate the potential of the new approach by modeling the breeding distribution of the Red Kite (Milvus milvus), a bird of prey occurring predominantly in Western Europe, based on presence/absence data from two mapping campaigns using grids of 40 km 2 in Bavaria. The global component of the model selected seven environmental variables extracted from the CORINE and WorldClim databases to predict Red Kite breeding. The effect of altitude was found to be nonstationary in space, and in addition, the data were spatially autocorrelated, which suggests that a species distribution model that does not allow for spatially varying effects and spatial autocorrelation would have ignored important processes determining the distribution of Red Kite breeding across Bavaria. Thus, predictions from standard species distribution models that do not allow for real-world complexities may be considerably erroneous. Our analysis of Red Kite breeding exemplifies the potential of the innovative approach for species distribution models. The method is also applicable to modeling count data.

AB Integrated information from different parts of the Mediterranean Sea was used to model the spatial and temporal variability of the distribution grounds of the sardine population. Acoustic data from the North Aegean Sea (Eastern Mediterranean), the Adriatic Sea (Central Mediterranean), the Sicily Channel (Central Mediterranean) and Spanish Mediterranean waters (Western Mediterranean) were analysed along with satellite environmental and bathymetric data to model the potential habitat of sardine during summer, autumn and early winter. Generalized additive models were applied in a presence-absence approach. Models were validated in terms of their predictive ability and used to construct maps exhibiting the probability of sardine presence throughout the entire Mediterranean basin as a measure of habitat adequacy for sardine. Bottom depth and sea surface temperature were the environmental variables that explained most of the data variability. Several areas along the Mediterranean coastline were indicated as suitable habitat for sardine in different seasons. An expansion of these areas over the continental shelf, up to 100 m depth, was consistently noticed from summer to winter. This was attributed to the horizontal movements of sardine related to spawning (i.e. winter period) and the peculiarities of the Mediterranean Sea where areas favouring growth, feeding and spawning processes tend to be localised and prevent a long range, offshore migration as opposed to large upwelling ecosystems. Moreover, within the study period, a positive relationship between the extent of sardine preferred habitat and landings was revealed for both summer and winter seasons throughout the entire Mediterranean Sea.

AB We investigated sex-related morphological and physiological responses to enhanced UV-B radiation in the dioecious species Populus cathayana Rehd. Cuttings were subjected to two UV-B radiation regimes: ambient (4.5 kJ m(-2) day(-1)) and enhanced (12.5 kJ m(-2) day(-1)) biologically effective UV-B radiation for one growing season. Enhanced UV-B radiation was found to significantly decrease the shoot height and basal diameter and to reduce the leaf area, dry matter accumulation, net photosynthesis rate (P(n)), chlorophyll a/b ratio (Chl a/b) and anthocyanin content. Enhanced UV-B radiation also increased chlorophyll pigment, leaf nitrogen, malondialdehyde and abscisic acid (ABA) content, superoxide dismutase and peroxidase activities and UV-B-absorbing compounds. No significant effects of enhanced UV-B radiation were found on biomass allocation, gas exchange (except for P(n)), photochemical efficiency of photosystem II or water use efficiency. Moreover, different sensitivity to enhanced UV-B radiation between males and females was detected. Under enhanced UV-B radiation, males exhibited significantly higher basal diameter and leaf nitrogen, and lower Chl a/b, ABA content, UV-B-absorbing compounds, as well as less decrement of leaf area and dry matter accumulation than did females. However, no significant sexual differences in these traits were found under ambient UV-B radiation. Our results suggest that males may possess a greater UV-B resistance than do females, with males having a more efficient antioxidant system and higher anthocyanin content to alleviate UV-B penetration stress than females.

AB Medicinal plants are highly valuable to human livelihood and the Indian Himalaya is well recognized amongst unique and globally important medicinal plant rich areas. Studies on possible effects of climate change on medicinal plants are particularly significant due to their value within traditional systems of medicine and as economically useful plants. There are evidences that climate change is causing noticeable effects on life cycles and distribution of the plant species. However, it is largely unclear about climate change effects on secondary chemicals production in plants and particularly in high altitude medicinal plants of Indian Himalaya. Elsewhere this perspective has been given renewed attention recently. A need for research to improve our understanding of these effects on high-altitude medicinal plants is stressed in the present article.

AB North Atlantic albacore and eastern Atlantic bluefin tunas perform feeding migrations to productive areas of the northeast Atlantic Ocean during the summer. Climate change is likely to influence the timing and even the spatial distribution of albacore and bluefin tunas during this event. Thus, tuna catches during their feeding migration to the Bay of Biscay have been analyzed from 1967 to 2005 for albacore tuna and from 1981 to 2005 for bluefin tuna. The results indicate that tuna arrive now earlier to the Bay of Biscay, with albacore tuna arriving about 8 days earlier than 40 years ago and bluefin tuna arriving 14 days earlier than 25 years ago. This represents a rate of change of 2 and 5.6 days per decade, respectively. Besides, albacore tuna mean catch latitude showed an increasing trend over time. Statistical analyses provided the first evidence of the North Atlantic regime shift, as well as climate variability, influencing changes in migration phenology and spatial distribution of albacore and bluefin tunas.

AB Proposed benefits of multiple paternity include increased reproductive output, elevated fitness of progeny, and maintenance of population genetic diversity. However, another consideration is whether multiple paternity is simply an unavoidable byproduct of sexual conflict, with males seeking to maximize mating encounters while females seek to minimize the stress of copulation. Here we examined the polyandrous mating system in sharks, with a focus on the reproductive genetics of the shortspine spurdog Squalus mitsukurii. Members of the genus Squalus are long-lived, slow-growing, and employ among the longest gestation periods of any vertebrate. To evaluate multiple paternity and genetic diversity in S. mitsukurii, we genotyped 27 litters plus 96 individuals with 8 microsatellite loci, Further, 670 bp of the mtDNA control region were sequenced in 112 individuals to examine population structure. S. mitsukurii in Hawaii showed low genetic diversity relative to other sharks (pi = 0.0010 +/- 0.0008) and no significant population structure in the Hawaiian Archipelago. Direct allele counts and Bayesian approximations returned concordant estimates of 11% multiple paternity, the lowest observed in sharks to date. Considering the protracted reproductive interval of S. mitsukurii, sexual conflict that results from differential male and female reproductive strategies may favor the development of female mating avoidance behavior to minimize trauma. In S. mitsukurii this behavior includes segregation of sexes and an asynchronous reproductive cycle.

AB Diversity is one major factor driving plant productivity in temperate grasslands. Although decomposers like earthworms are known to affect plant productivity, interacting effects of plant diversity and earthworms on plant productivity have been neglected in field studies. We investigated in the field the effects of earthworms on plant productivity, their interaction with plant species and functional group richness, and their effects on belowground plant competition. In the framework of the Jena Experiment we determined plant community productivity (in 2004 and 2007) and performance of two phytometer plant species [Centaurea jacea (herb) and Lolium perenne (grass); in 2007 and 2008] in a plant species (from one to 16) and functional group richness gradient (from one to four). We sampled earthworm subplots and subplots with decreased earthworm density and reduced aboveground competition of phytometer plants by removing the shoot biomass of the resident plant community. Earthworms increased total plant community productivity (+11%), legume shoot biomass (+35%) and shoot biomass of the phytometer C. jacea (+21%). Further, phytometer performance decreased, i.e. belowground competition increased, with increasing plant species and functional group richness. Although single plant functional groups benefited from higher earthworm numbers, the effects did not vary with plant species and functional group richness. The present study indicates that earthworms indeed affect the productivity of semi-natural grasslands irrespective of the diversity of the plant community. Belowground competition increased with increasing plant species diversity. However, belowground competition was modified by earthworms as reflected by increased productivity of the phytometer C. jacea. Moreover, particularly legumes benefited from earthworm presence. Considering also previous studies, we suggest that earthworms and legumes form a loose mutualistic relationship affecting essential ecosystem functions in temperate grasslands, in particular decomposition and plant productivity. Further, earthworms likely alter competitive interactions among plants and the structure of plant communities by beneficially affecting certain plant functional groups.

AB Despite a growing appreciation of the need to protect sensitive deep sea ecosystems such as cold-water corals, efforts to map the extent of their distribution are limited by their remoteness. Here we develop ecological niche models to predict the likely distributions of cold-water corals based on occurrence records and data describing environmental parameters (e.g. seafloor terrain attributes and oceanographic conditions). This study has used bathymetric data derived from ship-borne multibeam swath systems, species occurrence data from remotely operated vehicle video surveys and oceanographic parameters from hydrodynamic models to predict coral locations in regions where there is a paucity of direct observations. Predictions of the locations of the scleractinian coral, Lophelia pertusa are based primarily upon ecological niche modelling using a genetic algorithm. Its accuracy has been quantified at local (similar to 25 km(2)) and regional scales (similar to 4000 km(2)) along the Irish continental slope using a variety of error assessment techniques and a comparison with another ecological niche modelling technique. With appropriate choices of parameters and scales of analyses, ecological niche modelling has been effective in predicting the distributions of species at local and regional scales. Refinements of this approach have the potential to be particularly useful for ocean management given the need to manage areas of sensitive habitat where survey data are often limited.

AB Knowledge about the phylogenetic history, genetic variation and ecological requirements of a species is important for its conservation and management. Unfortunately, for many species this information is lacking. Here we use multiple approaches (phylogenetics, population genetics and ecological modelling) to evaluate the evolutionary history and conservation status of Capra walie, an endangered flagship species of wild goat endemic to Ethiopia. The analysis of mitochondrial cytochrome b and Y-chromosome DNA sequences suggests that C. walie forms a monophyletic clade with Capra nubiana, but potentially has been isolated for up to 0.8 million years from this closely related species. Microsatellite DNA analyses show that C. walie has very low genetic variation (mean heterozygosity=0.35) compared with other endangered mammals. This reduced variation likely derives from a prolonged demographic decline and small effective population size. Ecological niche modelling using the bioclimatic features of habitats occupied by C. walie, suggests ecological differences between C. walie and C. nubiana, and identifies the areas most suitable for future reintroductions of C. walie. The genetic and bioclimatic data suggest that C. walie is distinct and requires immediate conservation actions including genetic monitoring and reintroductions to establish independent populations. This study illustrates how combining noninvasive sampling along with genetic and ecological (bioclimatic) approaches can help assess conservation status of poorly known species.

AB It is widely accepted that improving the sustainability of seafood production requires efforts to reverse declines in global fisheries due to overfishing and to reduce the impacts to host ecosystems from fishing and aquaculture production technologies. Reflective of on-going dialogue amongst participants in an international research project applying Life Cycle Assessment to better understand and manage global salmon production systems, we argue here that such efforts must also address the wider range of biophysical, ecological, and socioeconomic impacts stemming from the material and energetic throughput associated with these industries. This is of particular relevance given the interconnectivity of global environmental change, ocean health, and the viability of seafood production in both fisheries and aquaculture. Although the growing popularity of numerous ecolabeling, certification, and consumer education programs may be making headway in influencing Western consumer perceptions of the relative sustainability of alternative seafood products, we also posit that the efficacy of these initiatives in furthering sustainability objectives is compromised by the use of incomplete criteria. An emerging body of Life Cycle Assessment research of fisheries and aquaculture provides valuable insights into the biophysical dimensions of environmental performance in alternative seafood production and consumption systems, and should be used to inform a more holistic approach to labeling, certifying, and educating for sustainability in seafood production. More research, however, must be undertaken to develop novel techniques for incorporating other critical dimensions, in particular, socioeconomic considerations, into our sustainability decision-making.

SO MARINE BIOLOGY

AB What to do about fisheries collapse and the decline of large fishes in marine ecosystems is a critical debate on a global scale. To address one aspect of this debate, a major fisheries management action, the removal of gill nets in 1994 from the nearshore arena in the Southern California Bight ( 34 degrees 26' 30 '' N, 120 degrees 27' 09 '' W to 33 degrees 32'03 '' N, 117 07 degrees 28 '' W) was analyzed. First, the impetus for the gill net ban was the crash of the commercial fishery for white seabass ( Atractoscion nobilis; Sciaenidae) in the early 1980s. From 1982 to 1997 catch remained at a historically low level ( 47.8 +/- 3.0 mt) when compared to landings from 1936 - 1981, but increased significantly from 1995 - 2004 ( r = 0.89, P < 0.01) to within the 95% confidence limit of the historic California landings. After the white seabass fishery crashed in the early 1980s, landings of soupfin ( Galeorhinus galeus; Triakidae) and leopard shark ( Triakis semifasciata; Triakidae) also significantly declined ( r = 0.95, P < 0.01 and r = 0.91, P < 0.01, respectively) until the gill net closure. After the closure both soupfin and leopard shark significantly increased in CPUE ( r = 0.72, P = 0.02 and r = 0.87, P < 0.01, respectively). Finally, giant sea bass ( Stereolepis gigas; Polyprionidae) the apex predatory fish in this ecosystem, which was protected from commercial and recreational fishing in 1981, were not observed in a quarterly scientific SCUBA monitoring program from 1974 to 2001 but reappeared in 2002 2004. In addition, CPUE of giant seabass increased significantly from 1995 to 2004 ( r = 0.82, P < 0.01) in the gill net monitoring program. The trends in abundance of these fishes return were not correlated with sea surface temperature ( SST), the Pacific Decadal Oscillation ( PDO) or the El Nino/ Southern Oscillation ( ENSO). All four species increased significantly in either commercial catch, CPUE, or in the SCUBA monitoring program after the 1994 gill net closure, whereas they had declined significantly, crashed, or were absent prior to this action. This suggests that removing gill nets from coastal ecosystems has a positive impact on large marine fishes.

AB Despite their narrow distribution, Australian rainforests still contain considerable levels of diversity and include many ancient, but often rare, lineages. Very little is known about the general biology of rainforest species, yet their long-term management depends on a better understanding of the main factors leading to rarity. For instance, are they highly endemic taxa, at the early stages of expansion, nearing the end of a period of decline, or persisting at low numbers over the long term? In this study we combine molecular, environmental, and ecological data to identify the factors responsible for the narrow distribution of a paleoendemic rainforest tree: Elaeocarpus sedentarius (Elaeocarpaceae). Between-population and between-generation comparisons of genetic diversity across all known populations of E. sedentarius show evidence of mutation-drift equilibrium rather than evidence of a recent bottleneck. Similarly, floristic and environmental data negate the hypothesis of rarity as a consequence of highly specialized habitat requirements. Instead, genetic structure and the available ecological data support the hypothesis of dispersal limitation as the main cause of endemism and that the species may have attained genetic equilibrium without realizing its full niche potential. We suggest that these factors are likely to explain narrow endemism in a broader range of taxa.

AB Over the last few decades it has become increasingly obvious that disturbance, whether natural or anthropogenic in origin, is ubiquitous in ecosystems. Disturbance-related processes are now considered to be important determinants of the composition, structure and function of ecological systems. However, because disturbance and succession processes occur across a wide range of spatio-temporal scales their empirical investigation is difficult. To counter these difficulties much use has been made of spatial modelling to explore the response of ecological systems to disturbance(s) occurring at spatial scales from the individual to the landscape and above, and temporal scales from minutes to centuries. Here we consider such models by contrasting two alternative motivations for their development and use: prediction and exploration, with a focus on forested ecosysterns. We consider the two approaches to be complementary rather than competing. Predictive modelling aims to combine knowledge (understanding and data) with the goal of predicting system dynamics; conversely, exploratory models focus on developing understanding in systems where uncertainty is high. Examples of exploratory modelling include model-based explorations of generic issues of criticality in ecological systems, whereas predictive models tend to be more heavily data-driven (e.g. species distribution models). By considering predictive and exploratory modelling alongside each other, we aim to illustrate the range of methods used to model succession and disturbance dynamics and the challenges involved in the model-building and evaluation processes in this arena.

AB Habitat fragmentation is known to generally reduce the size of plant populations and increase their isolation, leading to genetic erosion and increased between-population genetic differentiation. In Flanders (northern Belgium) Primula vulgaris is very rare and declining. Populations have incurred strong fragmentation for the last decades and are now restricted to a few highly fragmented areas in an intensively used agricultural landscape. Previous studies showed that small populations of this long-lived perennial herb still maintained high levels of genetic variation and low genetic differentiation. This pattern can either indicate recent gene flow or represent historical variation. Therefore, we used polymorphic microsatellite loci to investigate genetic variation and structure in adult (which may still reflect historical variation) and seedling (recent generation, thus affected by current processes) life stages. The recent generation (seedlings) showed a significant loss of observed heterozygosity (H,,) together with lower expected heterozygosity (H,), a trend for higher inbreeding levels (F-IS) and higher differentiation (F-ST) between populations compared to the adult generation. This might result from (1) a reduction in effective population size, (2) higher inbreeding levels in the seedlings, (3) a higher survival of heterozygotes over time due to a higher fitness of heterozygotes (heterosis) and/or a lower fitness of homozygotes (inbreeding depression), (4) overlapping generations in the adult life stage, or (5) a lack of establishment of new (inbred) adults from seedlings due to degraded habitat conditions. Combining restoration of both habitat quality and gene flow between populations may be indispensable to ensure a sustainable. conservation of fragmented populations.

AB The restoration of in-stream habitats by structural improvement of stream beds is more and more frequent, but the ecological consequences of such works are still little known. We have examined the influence of the deposit of a 15 cm gravel layer over the stream bottom on the chemical characteristics of the interstitial water, the sediment grain size and the composition of the benthic assemblages. We have compared a restored reach to an upstream control over three years and at three seasons each year. Dissolved oxygen, ammonium, nitrite and nitrate contents were measured in both surface and interstitial (-15 cm deep) waters, together with the depth of anoxia estimated using wooden stakes and fine sediment content at the surface. During the same period and seasons, benthic invertebrates were sampled at five points in each reach. The restoration induced an increase in vertical exchanges of water between surface and interstitial habitats, with an increase in the depth of hypoxia. Changes were observed in the composition of invertebrate communities, but not in the density or in the taxonomic richness of assemblages. These changes in assemblages were fragile: a local disturbance (such as a drying period) diminished the beneficial effect of the restoration with the disappearance of several organisms. The viability of such restoration works may be associated with catchment management designed to reduce fine sediment inputs to the river. Copyright (c) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Rising societal demands for forest resources along with existing natural disturbance regimes suggest that sustainable forest management will increasingly depend on better understanding the cumulative effects of natural and anthropogenic disturbances. In North America, for example, there is increasing economic pressure to salvage log burned forests, although the ecological consequences of combining fire and harvesting on the same sites are unclear. We examined the short-term (2 year) responses of boreal forest ground beetles (Coleoptera: Carabidae) to the individual and combined effects of wildfire, harvesting, and herbicide. Ground beetle responses to wildfire and forestry-related disturbances differed strongly and suggested that, although some species may appear to benefit from disturbance combinations (e.g., Sericoda quadripunctata (DeGeer)), these effects are detrimental to others (e.g., Sericoda bembidioides Kirby). Species compositional variability was significantly reduced by disturbance combinations suggesting that multiple disturbances may lead to a simplification of this entire assemblage. In addition, ground beetle responses were correlated with changes in several key habitat parameters such as amount of woody debris, exposed ground, and plant species richness suggesting avenues for future study. Overall, however, our results suggest that efforts to avoid compounding disturbances on any site should be considered when developing current and future forest management guidelines.

AB Mismatches between predator and prey due to climate change have now been documented for a number of systems. Ultimately, a mismatch may have far-reaching consequences for ecosystem functioning as decoupling of trophic relationships results in trophic cascades. Here, we examine the potential for climate change induced mismatches between zooplankton and algae during spring succession, with a focus on Daphnia and its algal food. Whereas the development of an overwintering population of daphnids may parallel shifts in phytoplankton phenology due to climate warming, changes in the photoperiod-temperature interaction may cause the emerging population of daphnids to hatch too late and mismatch their phytoplankton prey. A decoupling of the trophic relationship between the keystone herbivore Daphnia and its algal prey can result in the absence of a spring clear water phase. We extended an existing minimal model of seasonal dynamics of Daphnia and algae and varied the way the Daphnia population is started in spring, i.e., from free swimming individuals or from hatching resting eggs. Our model results show that temperature affects the timing of peak abundance in Daphnia and algae, and subsequently the timing of the clear water phase. When a population is started from a small inoculum of hatching resting eggs, extreme climate warming (+6 degrees C) results in a decoupling of trophic relationships and the clear water phase fails to occur. In the other scenarios, the trophic relationships between Daphnia and its algal food source remain intact. Analysis of 36 temperate lakes showed that shallow lakes have a higher potential for climate induced match-mismatches, as the probability of active overwintering daphnids decreases with lake depth. Future research should point out whether lake depth is a direct causal factor in determining the presence of active overwintering daphnids or merely indicative for underlying causal factors such as fish predation and macrophyte cover.

AB Current distributions and the structure of natural biomes in Europe have been largely affected by the Quaternary glaciations, which were prevalent for ca. 80% of the past two milion years. The evolutionary consequences of the Pleistocene climatic changes, the location of refugia in southern Eurasia, and their roles as generators of biodiversity for the entire continent, are still debated. Paleoecological and molecular findings suggested that both Mediterranean and non-Mediterranean Eurasian refuges likely hosted temperate species during the last glaciations. Additionally, the occurrence of cryptic northern refugia was recently postulated. The biogeography, taxonomy and conservation biology of southern European mammals will take advantage of the information stemming from phylogeographic research. In this paper I will draft the main climatic events that determined the paleoecology of southern Europe during the Late Pleistocene, I will review the assumptions and consequences of alternative phylogeographic models, and discuss some case studies of mammalian species.

AB Twelve native woody species were studied to investigate the influence of soil fertility and root morphology on colonization by arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi during seedling establishment and growth. Seedlings were grown in soils of low and high natural fertility. uninoculated or inoculated with AM fungi, under greenhouse conditions. The mycorrhizal root colonization and plant responsiveness were higher among early successional species than late successional ones. Among early successional species. in both soils, mycorrhizal colonization provided significant increase in total dry mass. growth rates of shoot and root, root length, density of root tissues, root surface area and P concentration and content in the shoot. Early successional species grown with AM fungi displayed significant decreases in carbon allocation to roots, specific root length and the length and incidence of root hairs. Mycorrhizal colonization did not affect the root morphology of the late successional species in either soil. The growth of these woody Species was influenced by differences in soil fertility. There was positive correlation between the degree of plant responses to AM inoculation with the percentage of root colonized by AM fungi. In both soils, plant responsiveness and mycorrhizal root colonization correlated positively to root-hair incidence and root-hair length and correlated negatively to fine-root diameter. The results Suggest that during the establishment of seedlings, the large responses to the inoculation and colonization of roots by AM fungi are related to both the successional status and root morphological plasticity of the host plant, regardless of soil fertility.

AB Given the frequent socioeconomic, political and concomitant ecological failures of science-driven marine protected area (MPA) programmes, it is now important to design MPAs by integrating natural an social science research more comprehensively. This study shows how indigenous peoples assisted in the design of MPAs by identifying marine substrates and related resident taxa on aerial photos, information which was then incorporated into a geographical information system (GIS) database, along with dive survey data. Two questions were asked: (1) Is indigenous ecological knowledge accurate enough for mapping the benthos and associated taxa? (2) Is such an approach an appropriate way for assisting in the biological and social design of MPAs in Oceania? Conventional quadrat field dive surveys were used to measure the accuracy of substrate identification by local informants and a visual survey was used to test hypotheses formulated from local knowledge regarding the spatial distribution and relative abundance of non-cryptic species within certain benthic habitats. Equivalence rates between indigenous aerial photo interpretations of dominant benthic substrates and in situ dive surveys were 75-85% for a moderately detailed classification scheme of the benthos, which included nine locally-defined abiotic and biotic benthic classes for the MPA seabed. Similarly, the taxa inventory showed a strong correspondence between the qualitative predictions of local fisherfolk and the quantitative analysis of noncryptic species distribution, including their relative abundance and geophysical locations. Indigenous people's predictions about the presence or absence of fish in different benthic habitats corresponded 77% and 92% of the time (depending on scoring schema) with in situ visual measurements. These results demonstrate how incorporating local knowledge of benthic heterogeneity, existing biological communities, and particular spatio-temporal events of biological significance into a GIS database can corroborate the production of scientifically reliable base resource maps for designing MPAs in an environmentally and culturally sound fashion. This participatory approach was used to design and then establish MPAs in the Roviana and Vonavona region of the Western Solomon Islands. Under appropriate conditions, interdisciplinary work can complement the design of scientific fishery management and biodiversity conservation prescriptions for coastal Oceania.

   Europe

ID PATTERNS
AB Existing methods for determining paleoprecipitation are subject to large errors (+/- 350-400 mm or more using mammalian proxies), or are restricted to wet climate systems due to their strong facies dependence (paleobotanical proxies). Here we describe a new paleoprecipitation tool based on an indexing of ecophysiological groups within herpetological communities. In recent communities these indices show a highly significant correlation to annual precipitation (r(2) = 0.88), and yield paleoprecipitation estimates with average errors of +/- 250-280 mm. The approach was validated by comparison with published paleoprecipitation estimates from other methods. The method expands the application of paleoprecipitation tools to dry climate systems and in this way contributes to the establishment of a more comprehensive paleoprecipitation database. This method is applied to two high-resolution time intervals from the European Neogene: the early middle Miocene (early Langhian) and the early late Miocene (early Tortonian). The results indicate that both periods show significant meridional precipitation gradients in Europe, these being stronger in the early Langhian (threefold decrease toward the south) than in the early Tortonian (twofold decrease toward the south). This pattern indicates a strengthening of climatic belts during the middle Miocene climatic optimum due to Southern Hemisphere cooling and an increased contribution of Arctic low-pressure cells to the precipitation from the late Miocene onward due to Northern Hemisphere cooling.

AB Forestry decreases the amount of dead wood, thereby threatening the persistence of many saproxylic (wood-living) organisms. This article discusses how targets for efforts to maintain and restore dead wood in managed forest landscapes should be defined. Several studies suggest extinction thresholds for saproxylic organisms. However, because the thresholds differ among species, the relationship between species richness and habitat amount at the local scale is probably described by a smoothly increasing curve without any distinct threshold. The most demanding species require amounts of dead wood that are virtually impossible to reach in managed forests. This means that unmanaged protected forests are needed. In managed forests, conservation efforts should focus on the landscape scale and on certain types of dead wood, but it is impossible to come up with any particular amount of dead wood that is desirable at the forest stand level.

AB Aim To assess the relative importance of climate, biotope and soil variables as well as geographical location for the species richness of plants, butterflies, day-active macromoths and wild bees in boreal agricultural landscapes.
   Location A total of 68 agricultural landscapes located in southern Finland.
   Methods Generalized linear mixed models were used to analyse the effects of environmental (climate, biotope and soil) and spatial (latitude and longitude) variables on species richness of four taxa in 136 study squares of 0.25 km(2). Using partial regression, the variation in species richness was decomposed into the purely environmental fraction; the spatially structured environmental fraction; and the purely spatial fraction, including variables retained in cubic trend surface regression.
   Results Species richness of all taxa was positively correlated with temperature. Species richness of plants and butterflies was also positively correlated with the heterogeneity of landscape. The extent of low-intensity agricultural land and forest had a positive effect, and the extent of cultivated field a negative effect on the species richness of these taxa. The effect of soil characteristics on the number of observed species was negligible for all taxa. The greatest part of the explained variation for all taxa was accounted for by the pure effect of geographical location. To a somewhat lesser extent, the species richness of plants, butterflies and bees was also related to the effects of spatially structured environmental variables, and the species richness of macromoths to the effects of environmental variables.
   Main conclusions Multi-species richness of boreal agricultural landscapes at the scale of 0.25 km(2) was associated with the heterogeneity of the local landscape. However, large-scale geographical variation in species richness was also observed, which indicates the importance of climate and geographical location for the taxa studied. These results highlight the fact that, even on a landscape scale, geographical factors should be taken into account in biodiversity studies. Heterogeneous agricultural landscapes, including forest and non-crop biotopes, should be preserved or restored to maintain biodiversity.

AB This study analyses the effect of resource availability (i.e. sheep dung) on dung beetle communities in an arid region of Central Spain, both at regional and at local scales. A total of 18 sites within 600 km(2) were sampled for the regional analysis and 16 sites within the 30 km(2) of an Iberian municipality were sampled for the local analysis. Spatial and environmental characteristics of sampling sites were also compiled at both scales, including measures of grazing activity (livestock density at regional scale, and two counts of rabbit and sheep dung at local scale). At a regional scale, any environmental or spatial variable can help to explain the variation in abundance. However, species richness was related to summer precipitation and composition was related to elevation. At local scale, abundance is not significantly related to any of the environmental variables, but species richness was related to the local amount of sheep dung (27% of variance). The amount of dung in a 2-km buffer around the site accounts for 27-32% of variance in abundance and 60-65% of variance in species richness. The presence of the flock with the highest sheep density explains 53% of abundance variability and 73% of species richness variance. A cluster analysis of localities identified two main groups, one characterized by a lower abundance and species richness that can be considered a nested subsample of the species-rich group. The mean and maximum amount of sheep dung in the sites separated by less than 2 km are the only significant explanatory variables able to discriminate both groups.
   These results suggest that grazing intensity (and the associated increase in the amount of trophic resources) is a key factor in determining local variation in the diversity and composition of dung beetle assemblages. However, dung beetle assemblages are not spatially independent at the analysed resolution, and the amount of dung in the surroundings seems to be more important for locally collected species than the dung effectively found in the site. Although differences in the availability and quantity of trophic resources among nearby sites could be affecting the population dynamics and dispersion of dung beetles within a locality, sites with larger populations, and greater species numbers would not be able to exercise enough influence as to bring about a complete local faunistic homogenization.

AB Nucleotide variation in an approximately 490 bp fragment of the mitochondrial DNA control region (mtDNA CR) was used to describe the genetic variation and phylogeographical pattern in the Eurasian beaver (Castor fiber) over its entire range. The sampling effort was focused on the relict populations that survived a drastic population bottleneck, caused by overhunting, at the end of the 19th century. A total of 152 individuals grouped into eight populations representing all currently recognized subspecies were studied. Sixteen haplotypes were detected, none of them shared among populations. Intrapopulation sequence variation was very low, most likely a result of the severe bottleneck. Extreme genetic structure could result from human-mediated extinction of intermediate populations, but it could also be an effect of prior substantial structuring of the beaver populations with watersheds of major Eurasian rivers acting as barriers to gene flow. Phylogenetic analysis revealed the presence of two mtDNA lineages: eastern (Poland, Lithuania, Russia and Mongolia) and western (Germany, Norway and France), the former comprising more divergent haplotypes. The low level of sequence divergence of the entire cytochrome b gene among six individuals representing six subspecies suggests differentiation during the last glacial period and existence of multiple glacial refugia. At least two evolutionary significant units (ESU) can be identified, the western and the eastern haplogroup. The individual relict populations should be regarded as management units, the eastern subspecies possibly also as ESUs. Guidelines for future translocations and reintroductions are proposed.

AB As once boldly stated, 'bad taxonomy can kill', highlighting the critical importance of accurate taxonomy for the conservation of endangered taxa. The concept continues to evolve almost 15 years later largely because most legal protections aimed at preserving biological diversity are based on formal taxonomic designations. In this paper we report unrecognized genetic divisions within the giant tortoises of the Galapagos. We found three distinct lineages among populations formerly considered a single taxon on the most populous and accessible island of Santa Cruz; their diagnosability, degree of genetic divergence and phylogenetic placement merit the recognition of at least one new taxon. These results demonstrate the fundamental importance of continuing taxonomic investigations to recognize biological diversity and designate units of conservation, even within long-studied organisms such as Galapagos tortoises, whose evolutionary heritage and contribution to human intellectual history warrant them special attention.

AB Urbanization has long been recognized to alter the hydrology, water quality and channel form of waterways. Recently, consideration of urban impacts on waterways has expanded to include assessment of the aquatic biota, generally focusing upon the macroinvertebrate fauna. This study compares the impacts of urbanization on the structure of stream benthic diatom communities in 16 first- and second-order streams in the east of Melbourne, Australia. Relationships between the physical elements of urbanization, water quality and diatom communities were examined using multivariate analyses with compositional similarity, and univariate analyses with selected diatom species and indices,. There was a strong negative correlation between urban density and the diatom indices of water quality. The element of urbanization most strongly related to the measured decline in the diatom community was drainage connection. Electrical conductivity was the most influential water quality variable. It is hypothesized that, in addition to increasing electrical conductivity, drainage connection may be impacting the diatom community by increasing the delivery of phosphorus during small storm events. The study suggests that reducing directly piped drainage connection using infiltration and retention is a logical step in the mitigation of urban impacts upon receiving streams. A corollary part of the project indicated strong potential for using overseas diatom indices in studies on water quality in southeastern Australia.

Extremely valuable to local fishing communities in aggregate, these micro-stocks are myriad and complex to study, monitor, assess and manage. Micro-stocks need assessment and management at local scales to prevent small components from suffering the tragedy of commons. This paper asks how can we ever hope to address the research and management needs of so many small resources? Community-based and territorial rights-based systems may help in sustaining these resources, but servicing the technical needs of many small communities of stakeholders raises problems. A new generation of 'barefoot ecologists' is envisaged to perform this task.

AB The links between weather and animal behaviour in population processes have received relatively little attention. I studied the effect of weather,conditions on foraging and breeding performance of a medium-sized raptor, the black kite, Milvus migrans. The frequency of prey capture attempts and their likelihood of success increased with temperature and declined with rainfall. Kites used flight styles involving a higher energy expenditure in less favourable weather. Nestling provisioning rates declined during rain spells. More kites hunted during periods of favourable weather and after periods with a high frequency of successful prey capture attempts by conspecifics; this result suggested that individuals may fine-tune their foraging effort to the expected foraging reward. Such compensatory behavioural adjustments may increase species resilience to climate change. The behaviourally mediated effects of weather on prey availability translated into population effects. Yearly weather conditions during the last stage of the prelaying period affected population-level productivity, probably through an effect on female body condition mediated by male provisioning capability and hunting yield. The predicted effects of climate change on kites may already be occurring, with progressively earlier laying and northward range expansion. These results confirm the need to pay greater attention to behaviourally mediated effects of climate on populations, particularly when individuals make compensatory adjustments that may enhance resilience to climate change.

AB Wild endangered populations can suffer from adverse effects on fitness due to inbreeding and environmental stress. Often, both genetic and environmental stress factors may be present in populations at the same time. Therefore knowledge on the potential interactions between these factors is important for the conservation of wild populations. When measuring fitness (e. g. survival and reproductive potential) of individuals in the laboratory, and in nature, inbreeding by environment interactions are now being reported more often. The increased focus on environmental dependency of inbreeding depression will therefore enable conservation biologists to include this knowledge in the management of endangered populations in the wild. In this study, the effects of environmental stress and inbreeding on fitness are estimated in a laboratory population of Drosophila buzzatii. Random- or full-sib mating were used to generate independent replicate lines of four different inbreeding levels (F = 0, F = 0.25, F = 0.50, F = 0.672) in four different environments. The environments were thermal and dimethoate stress separately and in combination, as well as a non-stressful control environment. Two experiments were carried out to measure productivity (a multiplicative measure of fecundity and viability) using a full factorial design. In the first experiment, productivity was estimated for all lines and inbreeding levels in the environment in which flies were inbred and reared for several generations. In the second experiment, productivity of the lines reared in the control environment was tested in all four environments and for all inbreeding levels. Our results show a significant effect of inbreeding and environmental stress on productivity in both experiments and the effect increased when flies were exposed to novel environmental conditions. Productivity was not affected by the interaction between inbreeding and environmental stress when flies were tested in the environments in which they were reared, whereas there was a tendency towards a stress by inbreeding interaction when flies were exposed to novel environments. The variance and the coefficient of variation in productivity were each affected by environmental stress and inbreeding, indicating that environmental conditions as well as genetic background are important for variation in productivity. However, the two measures of variation often showed opposite trends. The results obtained in this study indicate that the environmental conditions under which inbreeding occurs are important. This is relevant for the maintenance and management of populations in captivity and in relation to reintroduction of endangered species in nature.

AB Lutzomyia longipalpis(Diptera: Psychodidae: Phlebotominae), the main vector of visceral leishmaniasis in the Americas, is a putative species complex. Molecular polymorphism was characterized in a 266 bp fragment of L. longipalpis homologous to period, a 'speciation gene' from Drosophila. Samples from the Brazilian localities of Jacobina (BA), Lapinha (MG) and Natal (RN) were analysed and the data indicate that the three populations are highly differentiated, with a very low level of gene flow between them. These results are in agreement with published pheromone and copulation song studies that suggest the existence of a sibling species complex in Brazil.

AB The adaptive significance of polyandry by female birds in the absence of direct benefits remains unclear. We determined the frequencies of polyandrous mating and multiple paternity in the ruff, a lekking shorebird with a genetic dimorphism in male mating behavior. More than half of female ruffs mate with, and have clutches fertilized by, more than one male. Individual females mate with finales of both behavioral morphs more often than expected. Polyandrous mating was more likely following copulation interference, but interference was uncommon. The multiple paternity rate of ruffs is the highest known for avian lekking species and for shorebirds. The general hypothesis that pair-bond constraints are the major selective factor favoring multiple mating in birds does not predict our findings. Active genetic diversification, which has been widely dismissed as a functional explanation for polyandrous mating in birds, may apply with respect to the behavioral polymorphism in ruffs because of a Mendelian genetic basis for male behavioral morph determination and aspects of male-male cooperation and female choice. However; rates of multiple paternity in other species of lekking birds are higher than generally realized, and the potential benefits of diversification in general deserve further consideration.

AB Foliar fertilization is a widely used practice to correct nutritional deficiencies in plants caused by improper supply of nutrients to roots. The aim of the present study was to determine the efficiency of different forms of nitrogen-phosphorus-potassium (NPK) fertilizers applied to maize (Zea mays L.), either to the soil or to the leaves. Two sweet corn plants (CV Jubilee) were grown in plastic bags with 10.5 kg silt loam desert soil (Typic Haplocalcid). Before planting, the soil was mixed with zero (control), half or full dose of 0.6 g N, 0.4 g P, and 0.3 g K per pot as mineral forms, or as the "Global-Green" (GG) foliar fertilizer. Three forms of foliar fertilization were applied once a week in equivalent concentrations of N, P, and K (0.12gN, 0.08gP, and 0.06gK/L): Mineral forms (NPK), GG, and "Fertilizers & Chemicals" (F&C) foliar fertilizers; plain water acted as the control. The plants were harvested after 55 days. The roots were washed from the soil and length measured. The shoots were measured for leaf area, fresh and dry wt, and leaf contents of chlorophyll, N, P, and K. All indices increased in response to all forms of foliar fertilization (FF), but no significant difference was obtained between the different forms. Global-Green was less effective as a soil fertilizer (SF) than NPK. The effectiveness of FF appeared to be limited by the holding capacity of leaf surface area for the liquid fertilizer. It was concluded that FF may partially compensate for insufficient uptake by the roots, but requires sufficient leaf area to become effective.

AB Old World pitcher plants (Nepenthes spp., Nepenthaceae) trap and digest invertebrate prey to derive nutrients, primarily nitrogen (N). In the majority of lowland Nepenthes species studied to date, ants (Hymenoptera, Formicidae) are numerically the dominant prey taxon. Nepenthes albomarginata is unusual in showing an apparent bias towards the capture of termites (Isoptera). We tested the hypothesis that N. albomarginata derives N from termite capture, by comparison of foliar stable N isotope abundance (delta N-15) with a sympatric species (N. rafflesiana), whose verified major prey group is ants. N. albomarginata showed significantly lower delta N-15 values than N. rafflesiana, reflecting the lower delta N-15 value of termite tissue relative to that of ants, and suggesting a degree of prey segregation between the two Nepenthes species. Using mixing models, we estimated that termites (Hospitalitermes sp.) contribute 53.8 +/- 7.3 % of the total foliar N in A. albomarginata, and that ants (Crematogaster sp.) contribute 68.1 +/- 2.4 % of the total foliar N in N. rafflesiana. We also investigated the carbon stable isotope abundance (delta C-13) in both species. N. albomarginata showed higher delta C-13 values and a lower estimated intercellular partial pressure of CO2 (C-i) than N. rafflesiana, indicating either higher water use efficiency (due to water stress) or greater photosynthetic capacity.

AB African wild dogs are large, highly mobile carnivores that are known to disperse over considerable distances and are rare throughout much of their geographical range. Consequently, genetic variation within and differentiation between geographically separated populations is predicted to be minimal. We determined the genetic diversity of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region sequences and microsatellite loci in seven populations of African wild dogs. Analysis of mtDNA nucleotide diversity suggests that, historically, wild dog populations have been small relative to other large carnivores. However, population declines due to recent habitat loss have not caused a dramatic reduction in genetic diversity. We found one historical and eight recent mtDNA genotypes in 280 individuals that defined two highly divergent clades. In contrast to a previous, more limited, mtDNA analysis, sequences from these clades are not geographically restricted to eastern or southern African populations. Rather, we found a large admixture zone spanning populations from Botswana, Zimbabwe and south-eastern Tanzania. Mitochondrial and microsatellite differentiation between populations was significant and unique mtDNA genotypes and alleles characterized the populations. However, gene flow estimates (Nm) based on microsatellite data were generally greater than one migrant per generation. In contrast, gene flow estimates based on the mtDNA control region were lower than expected given differences in the mode of inheritance of mitochondrial and nuclear markers which suggests a male bias in long-distance dispersal.

AB The colonization of Lotus japonicus hypernodulating mutants, Ljsym78-1 and Ljsym78-2, by the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus Glomus sp. was characterized. The mutants are defective in systemic autoregulation of nodulation and nitrate inhibition, and form an excess of nodules and lateral roots. The percent root length colonized by the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi was significantly higher for the mutant than wild-type roots. Detailed assessment of the colonization indicated that the percentage of colonization by arbuscules was increased, but that by external hyphae, internal hyphae and vesicles was decreased, in the mutant roots compared with the wild-type. The succinate dehydrogenase activity of arbuscules, external hyphae and internal hyphae showed similar trends. In addition, the majority of individual arbuscules that formed on the mutant roots had a well-developed and seemingly tough morphology. The results suggest that mutation at the Ljsym78 locus positively stimulates the growth and activity of arbuscules, but leads to reduced growth and activity of hyphae. We report the first identification of Lotus japonicus mutants that show significantly increased arbuscule formation and termed these mutants Arb(++).

AB Complete sequences of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) are useful for the reconstruction of phylogenetic trees of mammals and, in particular, for inferring higher-order relationships in mammals. In this study, we determined the complete sequence (16,705 bp) of the mtDNA of a Japanese megabat, the Ryukyu flying fox (Pteropus dasymallus). We analyzed this sequence phylogenetically by comparing it with the complete sequence of mtDNAs of 35 mammals in an effort to reevaluate the enigmatic relationship between Megachiroptera and Microchiroptera and the relationships between them and other mammals. Maximum-likelihood analysis of 12 concatenated mitochondrial proteins from 36 mammals strongly suggested the monophyly of the order Chiroptera and its close relationship to Fereuungulata (Carnivora + Perissodactyla + Cetartiodactyla). We estimated that megabats and microbats diverged approximately 58 MyrBP and discussed the origin and early evolution of Chiroptera based on our findings.

AB We present a two-tiered analysis of molecular genetic variation in order to determine the origins of 'whale' products purchased from retail markets in Japan and the Republic of (South) Korea during 1993-1999. This approach combined phylogenetic analysis of mitochondrial DNA sequences for identification of protected species with a statistical comparison of intraspecific haplotype frequencies for distinguishing regional subpopulations or 'stocks' hunted for scientific research by the Japanese and killed incidentally in coastal fisheries by the Koreans. The phylogenetic identification of 655 products included eight species or subspecies of baleen whales, sperm whales, a pygmy sperm whale, two species of beaked whales, porpoises, killer whales and numerous species of dolphins as well as domestic sheep and horses. Sir; of the baleen whale species (the fin, sei, common-form and small-form Bryde's, blue or blue/fin hybrid, and humpback) and the sperm whale are protected by international agreements dating back to at least 1989 for all species and 1966 for some species. We compared the haplotype frequencies from the Japanese market sample to those reported from scientific hunting in the western North Pacific stock for products derived from the exploited North Pacific minke whale. The market sample differed significantly from the scientific catch (p < 0.001), showing a greater than expected frequency of haplotypes characteristic of the protected Sea of Japan stock. We used a 'mixed-stock' analysis and maximum-likelihood methods to estimate that 31% (95% confidence interval 19-43%) of the market for this species originated from the Sea of Japan stock. The source of these products was assumed to be undocumented 'incidental takes' from fisheries' by-catch, although we cannot exclude the possibility of illegal hunting or smuggling. The demographic impact of this undocumented exploitation was evaluated using the model of population dynamics adopted by the Scientific Committee of the International Whaling Commission. For the range of exploitation consistent with the market sample, this protected stock was predicted to decline towards extinction over the next few decades. These results confirmed the power of molecular methods in monitoring retail markets and pointed to the inadequacy of the current moratorium for ensuring the recovery of protected species. More importantly, the integration of genetic evidence with a model of population dynamics identified an urgent need for actions to limit undocumented exploitation of a 'protected' stock of whales.

AB Models of community organization involve variations of the top-down (predator control) or bottom-up (nutrient limitation) hypotheses. Verbal models, however, can be interpreted in different ways leading to confusion. Therefore, we predict from first principles the range of possible trophic level interactions, and define mathematically the instantaneous effects of experimental perturbations. Some of these interactions are logically and biologically unfeasible. The remaining set of 27 feasible models is based on an initial assumption, for simplicity, of linear interactions between trophic levels. Many more complex and non-linear models are logically feasible but, for parsimony, simple ones are tested first. We use an experiment in the boreal forest of Canada to test predictions of instantaneous changes to trophic levels and distinguish between competing models. Seven different perturbations systematically removed each trophic level or, for some levels, supplemented them. The predictions resulting from the perturbations were concerned with the direction of change in biomass in the other levels. The direct effects of each perturbation produced strong top-down and bottom-up changes in biomass. At both the vegetation and herbivore levels top-down was stronger than bottom-up despite some compensatory growth stimulated by herbivory. The combination of experiments produced results consistent with two-way (reciprocal) interactions at each level. Indirect effects on one or two levels removed from the perturbation were either very weak or undetectable. Top-down effects were strong when direct but attenuated quickly. Bottom-up effects were less strong but persisted as indirect effects to higher levels. Although the 'pure reciprocal' model best fits our results for the boreal forest system different models may apply to different ecosystems around the world.

AB Factorial greenhouse experiments were conducted to test hypotheses concerning the nature of the interaction between Verticillium dahliae and Pratylenchus penetrans or Pratylenchus crenatus in potato early dying. Soil was infested with known densities of V. dahliae and P. penetrans or V. dahliae and P. crenatus, and plants were destructively harvested 3, 5, 7, and 9 weeks after planting. Root samples were excised using a grid method and stained using an immunoenzymatic procedure. Root infection by V. dahliae was through the root tip and the zone of elongation, regardless of the presence of nematodes. Discrete colonies in the cortex were not observed, but rather the hyphae progressed into the cortex and grew towards the developing vascular tissues. Hyphae penetrated and grew in the young xylem elements and then colonized the vascular cylinder, or they were prevented from further development by a visible host response. Five weeks after planting, roots grown in soil infested with V. dahliae alone had a very low percentage of infected root tips (1.2%), which was significantly less (P < 0.02) than infected roots growing in soil infested with either V. dahliae and P. penetrans or V. dahliae and P. crenatus (2.3 and 2.5%, respectively). Roots were colonized by V. dahliae to a significantly greater extent (P < 0.01) when grown in soil infested with V. dahliae and P. penetrans (0.13 cm of colonized root/m of root) than in soil infested with V. dahliae alone or with V. dahliae and P. crenatus (0.05 and 0.02 cm of colonized root/m of root, respectively). This trend continued with differences among treatments more pronounced after 7 weeks. Low levels of initial root infection and colonization resulted in high incidences of stem colonization by V. dahliae in treatments with V. dahliae and P. penetrans (58% after 5 weeks and 100% after 7 weeks). Infection by V. dahliae was riot observed to be associated with the site of nematode feeding, and the effect of nematodes on initial infection may not be species-specific. The interaction between V. dahliae and P. penetrans in potato early dying may occur within the root early in the infection process, resulting in an altered or delayed host response to colonization by V. dahliae.

AB Wild-type (Steptoe) and abscisic acid (ABA)-deficient mutant (Az34) genotypes of barley were grown in compacted soil to examine the potential role of ABA as a root-to-shoot signal. Root and shoot growth and leaf conductance were all reduced when plants were grown in compacted soil with a bulk density of 1.7 g cm(-3) relative to uncompacted control plants (1.1 g cm(-3)), These effects occurred in the absence of detectable changes in leaf water status or foliar abscisic acid (ABA) content, Analysis of Steptoe and Az34 xylem sap showed that the ABA concentration was greatly increased at 6 d after emergence (6 DAE) when seedlings were grown in compacted soil (1.7 g cm(-3)); however, ABA concentrations were never as high in the mutant as in the wild type, The increase in xylem sap ABA concentration observed at high bulk density was closely correlated with reductions in leaf conductance, but not leaf area, These increases were transitory, and xylem sap ABA concentrations subsequently decreased towards the control level by 18 DAE in both genotypes.
   The ABA-deficient mutant, Az34, produced a much lower leaf area than Steptoe at a bulk density of 1.6 g cm(-3). Examination of epidermal characteristics indicates that this effect resulted mainly from reductions in cell expansion rather than cell division, suggesting that the higher ABA concentrations detected in xylem sap from the wild-type Steptoe may have exerted a positive role in maintaining leaf expansion in this treatment, The possible involvement of ABA as a root-to-shoot signal mediating the effects of compaction stress is discussed.

AB Ecological studies on small reef fish could often be improved by distinguishing among individuals or cohorts within populations, but this has not been possible with conventional tagging methods. Historically, tagging of recently settled juveniles has proven to be particularly necessary and difficult. What is needed is a method for individually recognising small individuals. Here, use of 2 types of implant microtag are verified for this purpose, visible implant fluorescent tags (VIF) and coded wire tags (CWT). Retention rates of these tags were determined when injected into 2 size classes of a coral-reef damselfish, Pomacentrus moluccensis (10 to 20 mm juveniles, 25 to 40 mm adults). The influence of tagging on growth and survivorship was also measured. Microtag retention rates were high: 100% for new settlers and between 80 and 100% for adults. In addition survivorship and growth of juveniles and adults were not significantly different for fish with or without microtags. These microtags should provide the means to understand the importance of processes occurring within a few weeks of settlement and throughout the reef-associated phase of small fishes.

AB Current selection on sexual size dimorphism was studied in a widely foraging non-territorial lizard, Ameiva plei. Males were significantly larger than females. Large males won intrasexual agonistic encounters and guarded females during their entire receptive period (1-4 days). Guarding males spent significantly less time foraging than males who were alone. Only males that guarded females were observed to mate. Mating success was highly skewed with only six of 21 mature males in the study site observed mating. All six males who mated were greater than or equal to 141 mm SVL (males mature at 62 mm SVL). The four largest males obtained 84% of all observed matings and were estimated to have fertilized 88% of the eggs. Sexual selection appears to favor large size in males due to competition among males to guard females. Large females on Anguilla also had higher reproductive success because SVL as positively correlated with clutch size and number of clutches in a season. It appears that natural selection has favored different trade-offs between growth and reproduction in males and females.

AB Analysing >40 plant traits and ecosystem properties over 10 years, the authors find moderate evidence for traits being predictors of ecosystem-level properties within years, but limited evidence for any effect across years.
   Earth is home to over 350,000 vascular plant species that differ in their traits in innumerable ways. A key challenge is to predict how natural or anthropogenically driven changes in the identity, abundance and diversity of co-occurring plant species drive important ecosystem-level properties such as biomass production or carbon storage. Here, we analyse the extent to which 42 different ecosystem properties can be predicted by 41 plant traits in 78 experimentally manipulated grassland plots over 10 years. Despite the unprecedented number of traits analysed, the average percentage of variation in ecosystem properties jointly explained was only moderate (32.6%) within individual years, and even much lower (12.7%) across years. Most other studies linking ecosystem properties to plant traits analysed no more than six traits and, when including only six traits in our analysis, the average percentage of variation explained in across-year levels of ecosystem properties dropped to 4.8%. Furthermore, we found on average only 12.2% overlap in significant predictors among ecosystem properties, indicating that a small set of key traits able to explain multiple ecosystem properties does not exist. Our results therefore suggest that there are specific limits to the extent to which traits per se can predict the long-term functional consequences of biodiversity change, so that data on additional drivers, such as interacting abiotic factors, may be required to improve predictions of ecosystem property levels.

AB Scientists of different disciplines have recognized the valuable role of terrestrial caves as ideal natural laboratories in which to study multiple eco-evolutionary processes, from genes to ecosystems. Because caves and other subterranean habitats are semi-closed systems characterized by a remarkable thermal stability, they should also represent insightful systems for understanding the effects of climate change on biodiversity in situ. Whilst a number of recent advances have demonstrated how promising this fast-moving field of research could be, a lack of synthesis is possibly holding back the adoption of caves as standard models for the study of the recent climatic alteration. By linking literature focusing on physics, geology, biology and ecology, we illustrate the rationale supporting the use of subterranean habitats as laboratories for studies of global change biology. We initially discuss the direct relationship between external and internal temperature, the stability of the subterranean climate and the dynamics of its alteration in an anthropogenic climate change perspective. Owing to their evolution in a stable environment, subterranean species are expected to exhibit low tolerance to climatic perturbations and could theoretically cope with such changes only by shifting their distributional range or by adapting to the new environmental conditions. However, they should have more obstacles to overcome than surface species in such shifts, and therefore could be more prone to local extinction. In the face of rapid climate change, subterranean habitats can be seen as refugia for some surface species, but at the same time they may turn into dead-end traps for some of their current obligate inhabitants. Together with other species living in confined habitats, we argue that subterranean species are particularly sensitive to climate change, and we stress the urgent need for future research, monitoring programs and conservation measures.

AB Heterotrophic soil microbial respiration-one of the main processes of carbon loss from the soil to the atmosphere-is sensitive to temperature in the short term. However, how this sensitivity is affected by long-term thermal regimes is uncertain. There is an expectation that soil microbial respiration rates adapt to the ambient thermal regime, but whether this adaptation magnifies or reduces respiration sensitivities to temperature fluctuations remains unresolved. This gap in understanding is particularly pronounced for drylands because most studies conducted so far have focused on mesic systems. Here, we conduct an incubation study using soil samples from 110 global drylands encompassing a wide gradient in mean annual temperature. We test how mean annual temperature affects soil respiration rates at three assay temperatures while controlling for substrate depletion and microbial biomass. Estimated soil respiration rates at the mean microbial biomass were lower in sites with higher mean annual temperatures across the three assayed temperatures. The patterns observed are consistent with expected evolutionary trade-offs in the structure and function of enzymes under different thermal regimes. Therefore, our results suggest that soil microbial respiration adapts to the ambient thermal regime in global drylands.

AB Although studies of elevational diversity gradient for microbes have attracted considerable attention, the generality of these patterns and their underlying drivers are still poorly understood. Here, we investigated bacterial distribution across a high elevational gradient (4328-5228 m a.s.l.) along the Nyainqentanglha mountains on the Southwestern Tibetan Plateau. We found a decreasing diversity trend with increasing elevation, with pH contributing most to the diversity variation, followed by elevation and mean annual temperature (MAT). Bacterial community composition differed taxonomically and phylogenetically with elevation. Furthermore, partial Mantel analyzes showed that bacterial community composition was significantly influenced by elevation, pH and MAT. Phylogenetic structure analysis indicated that deterministic processes (related to pH) determined bacterial community assembly along this elevation gradient. Our results reinforce the observed rule that pH is of foremost importance in driving bacterial elevational diversity patterns. We also suggest that absence of tree cover and of human disturbance might be important in allowing an underlying elevational trend to reveal itself. Review of other studies suggests that the trend of decreasing diversity at higher elevations might be generally true above the tree line.
   Soil pH dominates elevational diversity pattern for bacteria in high elevation alkaline soils on the Tibetan Plateau.

AB The five most pervasive anthropogenic threats to biodiversity are over-exploitation, habitat changes, climate change, invasive species, and pollution. Since all of these threats can affect intraspecific biodiversity-including genetic variation within populations-humans have the potential to induce contemporary microevolution in wild populations. We highlight recent empirical studies that have explored the effects of these anthropogenic threats to intraspecific biodiversity in the wild. We conclude that it is critical that we move towards a predictive framework that integrates a better understanding of contemporary microevolution to multiple threats to forecast the fate of natural populations in a changing world.

AB Plant species exert a dominant control over the nitrogen (N) cycle of natural and managed grasslands. Although in intensively managed systems that receive large external N inputs the emission of the potent greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O) is a crucial component of this cycle, a mechanistic relationship between plant species and N2O emissions has not yet been established. Here we use a plant functional trait approach to study the relation between plant species strategies and N2O emissions from soils. Compared to species with conservative strategies, species with acquisitive strategies have higher N uptake when there is ample N in the soil, but also trigger N mineralization when soil N is limiting. Therefore, we hypothesized that (1) compared to conservative species, species with acquisitive traits reduce N2O emissions after a high N addition; and (2) species with conservative traits have lower N2O emissions than acquisitive plants if there is no high N addition. This was tested in a greenhouse experiment using monocultures of six grass species with differing above-and below-ground traits, growing across a gradient of soil N availability. We found that acquisitive species reduced N2O emissions at all levels of N availability, produced higher biomass and showed larger N uptake. As such, acquisitive species had 87% lower N2O emissions per unit of N uptake than conservative species (p<.05). Structural equation modelling revealed that specific leaf area and root length density were key traits regulating the effects of plants on N2O emission and biomass productivity. These results provide the first framework to understand the mechanisms through which plants modulate N2O emissions, pointing the way to develop productive grasslands that contribute optimally to climate change mitigation.

AB The rate of evolution of population mean fitness informs how selection acting in contemporary populations can counteract environmental change and genetic degradation (mutation, gene flow, drift, recombination). This rate influences population increases (e.g., range expansion), population stability (e.g., cryptic eco-evolutionary dynamics), and population recovery (i.e., evolutionary rescue). We review approaches for estimating such rates, especially in wild populations. We then review empirical estimates derived from two approaches: mutation accumulation (MA) and additive genetic variance in fitness (I-Aw). MA studies inform how selection counters genetic degradation arising from deleterious mutations, typically generating estimates of <1% per generation. IAw studies provide an integrated prediction of proportional change per generation, nearly always generating estimates of <20% and, more typically, <10%. Overall, considerable, but not unlimited, evolutionary potential exists in populations facing detrimental environmental or genetic change. However, further studies with diverse methods and species are required for more robust and general insights.

AB Local adaptation arises as a result of selection by the local environment favoring phenotypes that enhance fitness. Geographic patterns of phenotypic variation are in part due to this selective process. Classically, the genetic basis of those phenotypes has been studied in plant populations using a quantitative genetic approach in which plants from different source populations are grown in common environments, in reciprocal transplant experiments, or in studies across a wide geographic and environmentally heterogeneous area. Limitations of these approaches to understanding the genetic basis of phenotypic variation can now be addressed with next generation sequencing, gene expression profiles, and epigenetic analysis. In this paper, I summarize contemporary genomic research on local adaptation by comparing findings from the Arabidopsis annual plant model system with long-lived tree species in four kinds of local adaptation studies: 1) genomic studies of transplant experiments; 2) landscape genomic studies; 3) gene expression studies; 4) epigenetic studies of local adaptation. Although the basic study designs of common garden, reciprocal transplants, and geographic variation have remained constant, the inclusion of contemporary genomic approaches has provided substantive advances in our understanding of the genetic underpinnings of local adaptation, including the impact of climate, the identification of candidate genes involved in genotype-by-environment interactions, and evidence for the potential role of epigenetic modification. Despite these advances, new questions are arising and key areas for future research include more exploration of gene networks in response to biotic and abiotic stressors and improved statistical tools for traits with polygenic inheritance.

AB Nitrogen (N) is a macronutrient essential for plant growth and development. Meanwhile, grafting is a method used to alleviate stress tolerance of various biotic and abiotic factors. This study aims to investigate how pumpkin grafting (PG) improves N use efficiency of watermelon. A commercial watermelon cultivar "Zaojia 8424" [Citrullus lanatus (Thunb.) Matsum. and Nakai.] was self-grafted and then grafted onto pumpkin (Cucurbita maxima xC. moschata) rootstock cv. Qingyan Zhenmu No. 1. The grafted plants were exposed to two levels of N (9 and 0.2 mM) under hydroponic conditions. The grafted plants were harvested at days 11 and 22 after low N (0.2 mM) treatment. PG improved the N use efficiency of watermelon scion through the vigorous root system of pumpkin rootstock that enhanced the uptake and accumulation of N, P, K, Ca, Mg, B, and Mn in watermelon. Gene expressions of nitrate reductase (Cla002787, Cla002791, and Cla023145) and nitrite reductase (Cla013062) genes were increased, promoting N assimilation. Mesophyll thickness and SPAD index (relative chlorophyll measurement) were also improved. Furthermore, pumpkin rootstock also enhanced the supply of zeatine riboside (ZR) and isopentenyl adenosine (iPA) in the leaves, promoting shoot growth. All these lead to improved plant growth and nitrogen use efficiency of pumpkin rootstock-grafted watermelon plants.

AB Around the world, recovery planning for threatened species is being applied in an attempt to stem the current extinction crisis. Genetic factors linked to small population processes (eg inbreeding, loss of genetic diversity) play a key role in species viability. We examined how often genetic factors are considered in threatened species recovery planning. We selected recent species recovery plans from Europe (n = 110), North America (the US only; n = 100), and Australia (n = 108), and reviewed three broad categories of genetic data they address: population-genetic, fitness-related, and life-history data. We found that the host country, taxonomic group to which the species belonged, and several proposed management actions were important predictors of the inclusion of genetic factors. Notably, species recovery plans from the US were more likely to include genetic issues, probably due to legislative requirements. We recommend an international standard, similar to an IUCN Red List framework, that requires explicit consideration of genetic aspects of long-term viability.

AB As a consequence of global climate-driven changes, marine ecosystems are experiencing polewards redistributions of species - or range shifts - across taxa and throughout latitudes worldwide. Research on these range shifts largely focuses on understanding and predicting changes in the distribution of individual species. The ecological effects of marine range shifts on ecosystem structure and functioning, as well as human coastal communities, can be large, yet remain difficult to anticipate and manage. Here, we use qualitative modelling of system feedback to understand the cumulative impacts of multiple species shifts in south-eastern Australia, a global hotspot for ocean warming. We identify range-shifting species that can induce trophic cascades and affect ecosystem dynamics and productivity, and evaluate the potential effectiveness of alternative management interventions to mitigate these impacts. Our results suggest that the negative ecological impacts of multiple simultaneous range shifts generally add up. Thus, implementing whole-of-ecosystem management strategies and regular monitoring of range-shifting species of ecological concern are necessary to effectively intervene against undesirable consequences of marine range shifts at the regional scale. Our study illustrates how modelling system feedback with only limited qualitative information about ecosystem structure and range-shifting species can predict ecological consequences of multiple co-occurring range shifts, guide ecosystem-based adaptation to climate change and help prioritise future research and monitoring.

AB We evaluated the suitability and performance of boosted regression trees (BRT) as a potential technique for soil mapping using a limited point dataset in an arid region of Iran. The model was applied using two approaches: logistic-BRT as an indirect approach and multiclass-BRT as a direct approach to produce soil class maps. In indirect prediction, the occurrence of relevant diagnostic horizons was first mapped and various maps were then combined for a pixel-wise classification by combining the presence or absence of diagnostic horizons. To allow combination of the indicator maps for classification into great groups, a decision tree was defined for linking the occurrence of diagnostic horizons to a soil great group. In direct prediction, the dependent variable was the great group itself and; therefore, the probability distribution of the soil great groups was directly predicted. Auxiliary data used in this study to represent predictive soil forming factors were terrain attributes and Landsat data as quantitative variables and a geomorphology map as categorical variable. To assess the added value of the geomorphology map, the most laborious auxiliary variable to obtain, the BRT-performance of 2 data situations was compared: (i) using only the DEM and remote sensing covariates and (ii) additionally using the geomorphology map. Results showed that the geomorphology map contributed importantly to the prediction accuracy. When it was removed from the predictors, the prediction accuracy strongly decreased. The maximum reduction in predictive performance of both indirect and direct models occurred in the absence of geomorphology map, particularly for soil classes whose presence has direct relationship with geomorphic surfaces. Generally, poor predictions seemed to be mainly due to low sample size, high variability of ancillary predictors and the inability of the geomorphology map to differentiate the strata in detail. In most predictions, the purity was better for the direct model. The indirect method predicted a high probability of salic horizon in playa landform, gypsic horizon in gypsiferous hills and calcic horizon in alluvial fans. The indirect method could provide an insight into the causes of errors in prediction at the level of diagnostic horizons, which could help in selecting better covariates. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB By selecting codistributed, closely related montane sedges from the Rocky Mountains that are similar in virtually all respects but one-their microhabitat affinities-we test predictions about how patterns of genetic variation are expected to differ between Carex nova, an inhabitant of wetlands, and Carex chalciolepis, an inhabitant of drier meadows, slopes, and ridges. Although contemporary populations of the taxa are similarly isolated, the distribution of glacial moraines suggests that their past population connectedness would have differed. Sampling of codistributed population pairs from different mountain ranges combined with the resolution provided by over 24,000 single nucleotide polymorphism loci supports microhabitat-mediated differences in the sedges' patterns of genetic variation that are consistent with their predicted differences in the degree of isolation of ancestral source populations. Our results highlight how microhabitat preferences may interact with glaciations to produce fundamental differences in the past distributions of presently codistributed species. We discuss the implications of these findings for generalizing the impacts of climate-induced distributional shifts for communities, as well as for the prospects of gaining insights about species specific deterministic processes, not just deterministic community-level responses, from comparative phylogeographic study.

AB Species adapted to cold-climatic mountain environments are expected to face a high risk of range contractions, if not local extinctions under climate change. Yet, the populations of many endothermic species may not be primarily affected by physiological constraints, but indirectly by climate-induced changes of habitat characteristics. In mountain forests, where vertebrate species largely depend on vegetation composition and structure, deteriorating habitat suitability may thus be mitigated or even compensated by habitat management aiming at compositional and structural enhancement. We tested this possibility using four cold-adapted bird species with complementary habitat requirements as model organisms. Based on species data and environmental information collected in 300 1-km(2) grid cells distributed across four mountain ranges in central Europe, we investigated (1) how species' occurrence is explained by climate, landscape, and vegetation, (2) to what extent climate change and climate-induced vegetation changes will affect habitat suitability, and (3) whether these changes could be compensated by adaptive habitat management. Species presence was modelled as a function of climate, landscape and vegetation variables under current climate; moreover, vegetation-climate relationships were assessed. The models were extrapolated to the climatic conditions of 2050, assuming the moderate IPCC-scenario A1B, and changes in species' occurrence probability were quantified. Finally, we assessed the maximum increase in occurrence probability that could be achieved by modifying one or multiple vegetation variables under altered climate conditions. Climate variables contributed significantly to explaining species occurrence, and expected climatic changes, as well as climate-induced vegetation trends, decreased the occurrence probability of all four species, particularly at the low-altitudinal margins of their distribution. These effects could be partly compensated by modifying single vegetation factors, but full compensation would only be achieved if several factors were changed in concert. The results illustrate the possibilities and limitations of adaptive species conservation management under climate change.

AB Root tissue density (RTD, the ratio of root dry mass to root volume) is a fundamental trait in comparative root ecology, being increasingly used as an indicator of plant species' resource use strategy. However, the lack of standardized method to measure this trait makes comparisons tricky. This study aims to compare three methods commonly used for determining fine RTD and to test whether root dry matter content (RDMC, the ratio between root dry mass and root fresh mass) could be used as a surrogate of fine root tissue density.
   RTD of 163 fine root samples was determined using (i) Archimedes' method, (ii) image analysis (WinRHIZO software), and (iii) using the root dry matter content as a proxy. Root samples belonged to different herbaceous species grown in different conditions.
   RTD measured with Archimedes' method was positively correlated with RTD estimated with image analysis and with RDMC. However we demonstrated that RTD measured with Archimedes' method was better predicted by RDMC (R-2 = 0.90) than by RTD measured with image analysis (R-2 = 0.56). The performance and limitations of each method were discussed.
   RDMC is a quick, cheap and relatively easy measurable root attribute; we thus recommended its measurement as a proxy of fine root tissue density.

AB Ecological theory on biological invasions attempts to characterize the predictors of invasion success and the relative importance of the different drivers of population establishment. An outstanding question is how propagule pressure determines the probability of population establishment, where propagule pressure is the number of individuals of a species introduced into a specific location (propagule size) and their frequency of introduction (propagule number). Here, we used large-scale replicated mesocosm ponds over three reproductive seasons to identify how propagule size and number predict the probability of establishment of one of world's most invasive fish, Pseudorasbora parva, as well as its effect on the somatic growth of individuals during establishment. We demonstrated that, although a threshold of 11 introduced pairs of fish (a pair is 1 male, 1 female) was required for establishment probability to exceed 95%, establishment also occurred at low propagule size (1-5 pairs). Although single introduction events were as effective as multiple events at enabling establishment, the propagule sizes used in the multiple introductions were above the detected threshold for establishment. After three reproductive seasons, population abundance was also a function of propagule size, with rapid increases in abundance only apparent when propagule size exceeded 25 pairs. This was initially assisted by adapted biological traits, including rapid individual somatic growth that helped to overcome demographic bottlenecks.

AB Many authors have pointed out the need for simpler assessment and management procedures for avoiding overexploitation in small-scale fisheries. Nevertheless, models for providing scientific advice for sustainable small-scale fisheries management have not yet been published. Here we present one model; the case of the Barefoot Fisheries Advisors (BFAs) in the Galician co-managed Territorial Users Rights for Fishing. Based on informal interviews, gray literature and our personal experience by being involved in this process, we have analyzed the historical development and evolution of roles of this novel and stimulating actor in small-scale fisheries management. The Galician BFA model allows the provision of good quality and organized fisheries data to facilitate and support decision-making processes. The BFAs also build robust social capital by acting as knowledge collectors and translators between fishers, managers, and scientists. The BFAs have become key actors in the small-scale fisheries management of Galicia and a case for learning lessons.

AB Conservation of biodiversity in fire-prone regions depends on understanding responses to fire in animal communities and the mechanisms governing these responses. We collated data from an Australian semi-arid woodland reptile community (4796 individuals captured over 6years) to: (i) determine the ability of commonly used shorter-term (2years) surveys to detect reptile responses to time since fire (TSF) and (ii) investigate whether ecological traits of species reliably predicted their responses to fire. Of 16 reptile species analysed, four had responses to TSF consistent with shorter-term surveys and three showed no response to TSF. Nine species had responses to TSF not detected in previous studies using smaller but substantial subsets of the same data. Among the 13 affected species, times of peak abundance ranged from 1 to 50years after fire. Nocturnal, burrowing species tended to be early successional and leaf-litter dwellers to be late successional, but these were only weak trends.Synthesis and applications. We found only limited support for a generalizable, trait-based model of succession in reptiles. However, our study revealed that the majority of common reptile species in our study region specialize on a post-fire successional stage and may therefore become threatened if homogeneous fire regimes predominate. Our study highlights the importance of interpreting results from time- or sample-limited fire studies of reptiles with the knowledge that many ecological responses may not have been detected. In such cases, an adaptive or precautionary approach to fire management may be necessary.

AB Marine protected areas created in a top-down way can be costly and ineffective due to low compliance of resource users. Conversely, employing users' local knowledge and involving them in decision-making processes could decrease costs and conflicts, in addition to increasing the chances of management success. Here the potential to change conflicting MPAs into conservation areas that take into account fishers' use and knowledge is assessed based on a case study on the Brazilian coast (Paraty town). Fishers (n=206) from 11 villages were interviewed regarding their main fishing targets and gear, and then only the experienced ones (n=41) were interviewed from three main fishing villages about the most important commercial species. Fish landings were sampled for one year in these three villages (n=823), where participatory mapping and group interviews with fishers were also conducted to determine their opinions regarding management and how they thought it should be undertaken. Management measures should not be equivalent across the whole region, as there were clear differences in the target species and gear used. Fishers identified 55 important fishing spots, eight of which were important for more than five villages, while the experts identified 10 important fishing areas for the target species, which was supported by the sampling of fish landings. The fishers were not opposed to management and no-take reserves but would make some changes in the current design of these measures if it were up to them. Based on these data, a few changes were indicated in the design of these areas that would likely reduce the conflict between fishers and enforcement agencies. This kind of approach could be used as a framework for adapting conflictive MPAs or to support the establishment of new ones where fisheries are relevant. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Temperature effects on predatorprey interactions are fundamental to better understand the effects of global warming. Previous studies never considered local adaptation of both predators and prey at different latitudes, and ignored the novel population combinations of the same predatorprey species system that may arise because of northward dispersal. We set up a common garden warming experiment to study predatorprey interactions between Ischnura elegans damselfly predators and Daphnia magna zooplankton prey from three source latitudes spanning >1500km. Damselfly foraging rates showed thermal plasticity and strong latitudinal differences consistent with adaptation to local time constraints. Relative survival was higher at 24 degrees C than at 20 degrees C in southern Daphnia and higher at 20 degrees C than at 24 degrees C, in northern Daphnia indicating local thermal adaptation of the Daphnia prey. Yet, this thermal advantage disappeared when they were confronted with the damselfly predators of the same latitude, reflecting also a signal of local thermal adaptation in the damselfly predators. Our results further suggest the invasion success of northward moving predators as well as prey to be latitude-specific. We advocate the novel common garden experimental approach using predators and prey obtained from natural temperature gradients spanning the predicted temperature increase in the northern populations as a powerful approach to gain mechanistic insights into how community modules will be affected by global warming. It can be used as a space-for-time substitution to inform how predatorprey interaction may gradually evolve to long-term warming.

AB In many areas of the world, grassland species have declined due to intensified agriculture and abandonment of unproductive sites. In rural areas, restoration approaches seek to counteract this loss. Additional potential for grassland restoration arises in urban settings, especially on large-scale wastelands isolated from suitable species pools.
   We explored the potential of urban wastelands for the development of low-maintenance meadows. We expanded on restoration approaches of rural landscapes by working with altered urban soils and existing wasteland vegetation. We tested if grassland species of regional provenances can be successfully reintroduced by comparing different restoration treatments: (1) transfer of a threshed seed mixture (Heudrusch) from local hay meadows, (2) seeding of species of regional provenances, (3) the same seeding combined with mycorrhizal inoculation.
   We revealed higher total species richness in all treated plots compared to the control, with similar proportions of grassland species. Both seeding treatments showed increased proportions of target species. The proportion of target species was stable in the seeding/mycorrhiza treatment and increased in the seeding only treatment from the second to the third year of the study to the same level. Urban soil features including stone content were negatively related to target species richness. In contrast, human-mediated impacts (e.g., dog intrusion) showed no significant effect on target species richness.
   Our experiment demonstrates that urban wastelands are suitable habitats for grassland species. Including extant soils and resident vegetation results in novel urban meadows with a considerable share of ruderal species but where rare grassland species are able to persist. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Combined application of organic and inorganic amendments was known to play a significant role in improvement of soil properties. A field experiment was conducted to explore the effects of gypsum, farmyard manure and commercial humic acid application on the amelioration of salt affected (saline sodic) soil. During this study, soil pH, electrical conductivity, sodium adsorption ratio, responses of root length and rice paddy yield were examined. Application of gypsum with or without farm manure and commercial humic acid decreased soil pH (8.26%), electrical conductivity (from 6.35 dS/m to 2.65 dS/m) and sodium adsorption ratio (from 26.56 to 11.60), and increased root length (from 9.17 cm to 22.6 cm) and paddy yield (from 695.7 kg/ha to 1644 kg/ha). A negative but significant correlation was observed between root length and electrical conductivity, sodium adsorption ratio (r = -0.93; -0.94, respectively, P <= 0.05), whereas positive and significant correlation with paddy yield (r = 0.96; P <= 0.05).

AB Species distribution models (SDMs) are increasingly used to forecast impacts of climate change on species geographic distributions, but the reliability of predictions is scrutinized. The main limitation of SDMs lies in their assumption that species' ranges are determined mostly by climate, which is arguable. For instance, biotic interactions, habitat and elevation may affect species ranges. The inclusion of habitat-related variables as predictors in SDMs is generally accepted, but there is no consensus regarding the inclusion of elevation. A review of randomly chosen literature revealed that elevation is used as a predictor variable by just over half of the papers studied with no apparent trends as to why, except that papers predicting mammal species distributions for large regions included elevation more often than not, and that papers that predicted mammal ranges for small regions tended to exclude elevation. In addition, we compared the performance of SDMs with and without elevation as a predictor variable for the distribution of north European mammals and plants and found that the difference between their performances is statistically significant for mammals, slightly favouring exclusion of elevation. No differences were found for plants. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Aim Because intertidal organisms often live close to their physiological tolerance limits, they are potentially sensitive indicators of climate-driven changes in the environment. The goals of this study were to assess the effect of climatic and non-climatic factors on the geographical distribution of intertidal macroalgae, and to predict future distributions under different climate-warming scenarios. Location North-western Iberian Peninsula, southern Europe. Methods We developed distribution models for six ecologically important intertidal seaweed species. Occurrence and microhabitat data were sampled at 1-km2 resolution and analysed with climate variables measured at larger spatial scales. We used generalized linear models and applied the deviance and Bayesian information criterion to model the relationship between environmental variables and the distribution of each target species. We also used hierarchical partitioning (HP) to identify predictor variables with higher independent explanatory power. Results The distributions of Himanthalia elongata and Bifurcaria bifurcata were correlated with measures of terrestrial and marine climate, although in opposite directions. Model projections under two warming scenarios indicated the extinction of the former at a faster rate in the Cantabrian Sea (northern Spain) than in the Atlantic (west). In contrast, these models predicted an increase in the occurrence of B. bifurcata in both areas. The occurrences of Ascophyllum nodosum and Pelvetia canaliculata, species showing rather static historical distributions, were related to specific non-climatic environmental conditions and locations, such as the location of sheltered sites. At the southernmost distributional limit, these habitats may present favourable microclimatic conditions or provide refuges from competitors or natural enemies. Model performances for Fucus vesiculosus and F. serratus were similar and poor, but several climatic variables influenced the occurrence of the latter in the HP analyses. Main conclusions The correlation between species distributions and climate was evident for two species, whereas the distributions of the others were associated with non-climatic predictors. We hypothesize that the distribution of F. serratus responds to diverse combinations of factors in different sections of the north-west Iberian Peninsula. Our study shows how the response of species distributions to climatic and non-climatic variables may be complex and vary geographically. Our analyses also highlight the difficulty of making predictions based solely on variation in climatic factors measured at coarse spatial scales.

AB Habitat loss and associated fragmentation effects are well-recognised threats to biodiversity. Loss of functional connectivity (mobility, gene flow and demographic continuity) could result in population decline in altered habitat, because smaller, isolated populations are more vulnerable to extinction. We tested whether substantial habitat reduction plus fragmentation is associated with reduced gene flow in three 'decliner' woodland-dependent bird species (eastern yellow robin, weebill and spotted pardalote) identified in earlier work to have declined disproportionately in heavily fragmented landscapes in the Box-Ironbark forest region in north-central Victoria, Australia. For these three decliners, and one 'tolerant' species (striated pardalote), we compared patterns of genetic diversity, relatedness, effective population size, sex-ratios and genic (allele frequency) differentiation among landscapes of different total tree cover, identified population subdivision at the regional scale, and explored fine-scale genotypic (individual-based genetic signature) structure. Unexpectedly high genetic connectivity across the study region was detected for 'decliner' and 'tolerant' species. Power analysis simulations suggest that moderate reductions in gene flow should have been detectable. However, there was evidence of local negative effects of reduced habitat extent and structural connectivity: slightly lower effective population sizes, lower genetic diversity, higher within-site relatedness and altered sex-ratios (for weebill and eastern yellow robin) in 10 x 10 km 'landscapes' with low vegetation cover. We conclude that reduced structural connectivity in the Box-Ironbark ecosystem may still allow sufficient gene flow to avoid the harmful effects of inbreeding in our study species. Although there may still be negative consequences of fragmentation for demographic connectivity, the high genetic connectivity of mobile bird species in this system suggests that reconnecting isolated habitat patches may be less important than increasing habitat extent and/or quality if these need to be traded off.

AB Efficient management and conservation of natural habitats requires a thorough knowledge and sustained monitoring of their ecological quality. In recent years, several methods have been developed to assess the local conservation status in the field. These typically combine estimates of coarse-scale indicators, such as tree and grass encroachments, with very fine-scale indicators that require precise fieldwork, such as the number of key species present. We first tested whether coarse-scale field characteristics can provide information on fine-scale indicators. Then, this idea was extended to remote sensing techniques to derive estimates of fine-scale properties that cannot be derived directly by the sensors. The method was elaborated for two Natura 2000 heathland areas, combining field conservation status assessments of over 650 locations with remote sensing information derived from an airborne hyperspectral scanner image. Boosted regression trees using field estimates of coarse-scale parameters as predictors were able to explain up to 43% of the variation in the fine-scale indicators. When using remote sensing data, models performed only slightly less. Up to 35% of the variation was explained using remote sensing estimates of coarse-scale parameters as predictors, and up to 39% was explained when additional remotely sensed land cover data were included in the models. Although these rates are not high in absolute terms, model predictions for certain parameters were more precise than field estimates, especially for criteria with a high between-observer variability. These results clearly illustrate the potential of remote sensing imagery to derive information on the conservation status of habitats, even for fine-scale elements that are too small to be derived directly.

AB Aquatic biodiversity faces increasing threats from climate change, escalating exploitation of water and land use intensification. Loss of vegetation in catchments (= watersheds) has been identified as a substantial problem for many river basins, and there is an urgent need to better understand how climate change may interact with changes in catchment vegetation to influence the ecological condition of freshwater ecosystems. We used 20 years of biological monitoring data from Victoria, southeastern Australia, to explore the influences of catchment vegetation and climate on stream macroinvertebrate assemblages. Southeastern Australia experienced a severe drought from 1997 to 2009, with reductions of stream flows >50% in some areas. The prolonged drying substantially altered macroinvertebrate assemblages, with reduced prevalence of many flow-dependent taxa and increased prevalence of taxa that are tolerant of low-flow conditions and poor water quality. Stream condition, as assessed by several commonly used macroinvertebrate indices, was consistently better in reaches with extensive native tree cover in upstream catchments. Prolonged drought apparently caused similar absolute declines in macroinvertebrate condition indices regardless of vegetation cover, but streams with intact catchment and riparian vegetation started in better condition and remained so throughout the drought. The largest positive effects of catchment tree cover on both water quality and macroinvertebrate assemblages occurred above a threshold of ca. 60% areal tree cover in upstream catchments and in higher rainfall areas. Riparian tree cover also had positive effects on macroinvertebrate assemblages, especially in warmer catchments. Our results suggest that the benefits of extensive tree cover via improved water quality and in-channel habitat persist during drought and show the potential for vegetation management to reduce negative impacts of climatic extremes for aquatic ecosystems.

AB The Australian sea lion, Neophoca cinerea, one of the world's rarest otariids, is notable for an asynchronous, aseasonal breeding chronology. Determining the ecological features that shape the genetic structure of marine predators such as Australian sea lions is challenging because their demersal foraging habitat is difficult to observe and quantify. Recent developments in stable isotope screening techniques using milk-dependent pups as proxies for maternal isotope signatures identified temporally stable, alternative (inshore and offshore) foraging ecotypes in adult female Australian sea lions. We combined this technique with mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) analysis of samples of 40-60% of all pups produced at 17 of the largest South Australian colonies to determine whether ecological specialization in foraging ecotype within and between colonies has shaped maternal population structure within the species. Genetic isolation by distance was apparent at very fine geographical scales with three distinct clusters of colonies that share multiple haplotypes being interspersed with isolated breeding sites. There was no congruence between mtDNA haplotype distribution and foraging ecotypes suggesting that observed behavioural specialization was not maintained along matrilines. We propose that foraging specialization within discrete fine-scale foraging areas and habitats at the individual level limits the dispersive capacity of adult female Australian sea lions which in turn drives population structure. Given this species' vulnerability to anthropogenic impacts and the high degree of female population structure, determining the extent of male-mediated gene flow in this species is critical. Only then can breeding colony connectivity be established and appropriate management units identified for the species. Crown Copyright (C) 2011.

AB Understanding the maintenance of sexual reproduction constitutes a difficult problem for evolutionaiy biologists because of the immediate costs that sex seems to incur. Typically, general benefits to sex and recombination are investigated that might outweigh these costs. However, several factors can strongly influence the complex balance between costs and benefits of sex; these include constraints on the evolution of asexuality, ecological differentiation, and certain life-history traits. We review these factors and their empirical support for the first time in a unified framework and find that they can reduce the costs of sex, circumvent them, or make them inapplicable. These factors can even tip the scales to a net benefit for sex. The reviewed factors affect species and species groups differently, and we conclude consequently that understanding the maintenance of sex could turn out to be more species-specific than commonly assumed. Interestingly, our study suggests that, in some species, no general benefits to sex and recombination might be needed to understand the maintenance of sex, as in our case study of dandelions.

ID MARINE RESOURCE-MANAGEMENT; FISHING SPOTS; COMANAGEMENT
AB Artisanal fisheries are of great importance in Brazil, as they are responsible for more than 50% of national fish production. This importance, associated with the necessity of conserving marine environments threatened by multiple competing uses, leads us to propose mechanisms for co-management of fisheries by users and public authorities. This proposal takes into account: a) local conflicts between artisanal and industrial fishers; b) local rules over the use of fishing areas established by artisanal fishers; c) the advent of protected areas that close access to some fishing areas used by artisanal fisheries; and d) co-management options being explored between government and fishers. This study suggests policy and technical alternatives under consideration to manage the artisanal fisheries of southeastern Brazil with a focus on Ilha Grande bay in Rio de Janeiro. In our case study, based on field research conducted in 2009, we show that artisanal fishers are squeezed into a marine space between protected areas and industrial fishing. We suggest that a combination of fishing agreements (FAs), based on experience in Amazonian fisheries and extractive reserves, and payment for environmental services (PES), based on forest and related water resource experience, could improve management and livelihoods for local artisanal fisheries by stimulating and rewarding fishers who participate in conservation efforts. The two instruments (FAs and PES) are the subject of considerable research and practical experience. Their integration in an instrument mix represents a contribution from transdisciplinary fields of human ecology and ecological economics. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Reintroduction guidelines recommend that 'adequate' numbers of individuals be released to minimize loss of genetic diversity, but these numbers are rarely quantified. We present a framework for assessing the number of individuals required for an island reintroduction that takes account of allele loss both during the founding event and in the following establishment phase with a low population size. This is the first attempt to model release numbers for reintroductions in order to preserve alleles with a specified initial frequency, while taking post-release mortality rates, population growth rates and site carrying capacity into account. Probability of allele retention was sensitive to both release number and post-release demography. The rate of allele loss was strongly influenced by both environmental stochasticity and delayed population growth but was little affected by increasing the annual turnover rate of the breeding population. We illustrate the model's application using parameter estimates from a threatened New Zealand passerine, the mohua Mohoua ochrocephala, for which reintroduction is a common management tool. Our modelling indicates that when population growth is moderate (lambda = 1.3), c. 60 individuals would need to be released to achieve at least 95% certainty that alleles at an initial frequency of 0.05 would be retained after 20 years (five overlapping generations), which is double the number typically released in translocations of mohua and other threatened forest passerines in New Zealand.

AB Net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) and water fluxes of extensively managed grassland in Germany were measured in a dry year, 2003 and a normal year, 2004 using eddy covariance. Empirical descriptions of canopy capacities (light utilization efficiency and canopy capacity for maximum carboxylation) and inherent water use efficiency (IWUE*) were computed to indicate the grassland's response to environmental and management conditions. Compared with 2004, 2003 was characterized by a 2.5 degrees C rise in summer mean temperature and an annual precipitation deficit of 286 mm, which was almost one-third below the average precipitation of the normal year 2004 and the long-term annual average (1959-2005). Annual net water balance (precipitation minus evapo-transpiration) in 2003 and 2004 were 85 mm and 361 mm, respectively. Slightly higher IWUE* in 2003 indicates the grassland's sensitivity to drought. The grassland provided an annual gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (R-eco) of 1022 and 728 g C m(-2) respectively in 2003, as compared to their corresponding values of 1233 and 973 g C m(-2) in 2004. Drought-induced biomass senescence caused GPP reduction in 2003, which in turn affected the ecosystem respiration. Light explained more than 80% of NEE variability during canopy development and as a result, annual NEE in 2003 and 2004 were -295 and -260g C m(-2), respectively. Taking into account the exported carbon by biomass harvest, we calculated net biome productivity (NBP) of -113 g C m(-2) yr(-1). We conclude that this managed grassland acted as a moderate carbon sink, despite the difference in environmental and management conditions. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl.) is a widely distributed species in the Pacific Northwest of North America. The extent that the current distribution of this species may be altered under a changing climate is an important question for managers of wood supply as well as those interested in conservation of subalpine ecosystems. In this paper, we address the question, how much might the current range of the species shift under a changing climate? We first assessed the extent that suboptimal temperature, frost, drought, and humidity deficits affect photosynthesis and growth of the species across the Pacific Northwest with a process-based model (3-PG). We then entered the same set of climatic variables into a decision-tree model, which creates a suite of rules that differentially rank the variables, to provide a basis for predicting presence or absence of the species under current climatic conditions. The derived decision-tree model successfully predicted weighted presence and absence recorded on 12,660 field survey plots with an accuracy of similar to 70%. The analysis indicated that sites with significant spring frost, summer temperatures averaging < 15A degrees C and soils that fully recharged from snowmelt were most likely to support lodgepole pine. Based on these criteria, we projected climatic conditions through the twenty-first century as they might develop without additional efforts to reduce carbon emissions using the Canadian Climate Centre model (CGCM2). In the 30-year period centered around 2020, the area suitable for lodgepole pine in the Pacific Northwest was projected to be reduced only slightly (8%). Thereafter, however, the projected climatic conditions appear to progressively favor other species, so that by the last 30 years of twenty-first century, lodgepole pine could be nearly absent from much of its current range. We conclude that process-based models, because they are highly sensitive to seasonal variation in solar radiation, are well adapted to identify the importance of different climatic variables on photosynthesis and growth. These same variables, once indentified, and run through a decision-tree model, provide a reasonable approach to predict current and future patterns in a species' distribution.

AB In this paper we evaluate different methods to predict soil erosion processes. We derived different layers of predictor variables for the study area in the Northern Chianti, Italy, describing the soil-lithologic complex, land use, and topographic characteristics. For a subcatchment of the Orme River, we mapped erosion processes by interpreting aerial photographs and field observations. These were classified as erosional response units (ERU), i.e. spatial areas of homogeneous erosion processes. The ERU were used as the response variable in the soil erosion modelling process. We applied two models i) bootstrap aggregation (Random Forest: RF), and ii) stochastic gradient boosting (TreeNet: TN) to predict the potential spatial distribution of erosion processes for the entire Orme River catchment. The models are statistically evaluated using training data and a set of performance parameters such as the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), Cohen's Kappa, and pseudo R2. Variable importance and response curves provide further insight into controlling factors of erosion. Both models provided good performance in terms of classification and calibration; however, TN outperformed RF. Similar classes such as active and inactive landslides can be discriminated and well interpreted by considering response curves and relative variable importance. The spatial distribution of the predicted erosion susceptibilities generally follows topographic constraints and is similar for both models. Hence, the model-based delineation of ERU on the basis of soil and terrain information is a valuable tool in geomorphology; it provides insights into factors controlling erosion processes and may allow the extrapolation and prediction of erosion processes in unsurveyed areas.

AB P>1. The juvenile stages of fish are often dependent on specific habitat types for their survival. Protecting these habitats may be crucial for maintaining strong adult stocks. The Natura 2000 network of the European Union offers protection of marine habitats that are essential for the recruitment of many fish species. By protecting these critical habitats the network may be important for maintaining the stocks of these fish species.
   2. We present a spatially explicit, GIS-based, assessment of two important components of the ecological coherence of Marine Protected Area (MPA) networks: representativity and connectivity. Representativity can be measured as the proportion of each conservation feature that is protected, whereas connectivity assesses the spatial configuration of the network. We apply these analyses to study the ecological coherence of the Natura 2000 network in a 30 000-km2 archipelago in the Baltic Sea, with respect to a coastal fish assemblage and associated habitats. The analyses are based on fish distribution maps that have been constructed by statistically relating life stage specific occurrence to environmental variables, and thereafter making spatial predictions based on maps of the environmental variables.
   3. The map-based analyses show that both the representativity and the connectivity of the network are poor with respect to the studied fish species. In total, 3 center dot 5% (11 km2) of the assemblage recruitment habitat was protected and 48% of the potentially connected habitats were included in the MPA network.
   4. The assessment explicitly identified geographical areas, visually communicated using maps, where the network should be improved to ensure ecological coherence.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Many MPA networks around the world, such as the Natura 2000 network in Europe, have recently come into effect. Establishment of the networks has often been governed by opportunity rather than by strict ecological analyses, primarily because distribution maps of species and habitats have been unavailable. Map-based assessments of the strengths and weaknesses of evolving MPA networks, such as the one presented here, are needed in adaptive management. They can provide an efficient tool for visualising and communicating the results to stakeholders and policy makers in the process of working towards ecological coherence.

AB Species' ranges are dynamic, shifting in response to a large number of interrelated ecological and anthropogenic processes. Climate change is thought to be one of the most influential drivers of range shifts, but the effects of other confounded ecological processes are often ignored even though these processes may modify expected range responses to climate change. To determine the relative effects of climate, forest availability, connectivity, and biotic processes such as immigration and establishment, we examine range changes occurring in a species of bird, the Hooded Warbler (Wilsonia citrina). We focus predominantly on the periphery of the species' northern range in Canada but we also examine data from the entire species' range. Nesting records in southern Ontario were obtained from two breeding bird Atlases of Ontario separated by a period of 20 years (1981-1985 and 2001-2005), and the rate of range expansion was estimated by comparing the number of occupied areas in each Atlas. Twelve hypotheses of the relationship between the rate of range expansion and factors known to influence range change were examined using model-selection techniques and a mixed modeling approach (zero-inflated Poisson's regression). Cooler temperatures were positively related to a lack of range expansion indicating that climate constrained the species' distribution. Establishment probability (based on the number of occupied, neighboring Atlas squares) and immigration from populations to the south (estimated using independent data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey) were also important predictors of range expansion. These biotic process variables can mask the effects of forest availability and connectivity on range expansion. Expansion due to climate change may be slower in fragmented systems, but the rate of expansion will be influenced largely by biotic processes such as proximity to neighboring populations.

AB Historical drainage patterns adjacent to the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau differed markedly from those of today. We examined the relationship between drainage history and geographic patterns of genetic variation in the Yunnan spiny frog, Nanorana yunnanensis, using approximately 981 base pairs of mitochondrial DNA partial sequences from protein-coding genes ND1 and ND2, and intervening areas including complete tRNAIle, tRNAGln and tRNAMet. Two null hypotheses were tested: (i) that genetic patterns do not correspond to the development of drainage systems and (ii) that populations had been stable and not experienced population expansion, bottlenecking and selection. Genealogical analyses identified three, major, well-supported maternal lineages, each of which had two sublineages. These divergent lineages were completely concordant with six geographical regions. Genetic structure and divergence were strongly congruent with historical rather than contemporary drainage patterns. Most lineages and sublineages were formed via population fragmentation during the rearrangement of paleodrainage basins in the Early Pliocene and Early Pleistocene. Sympatric lineages occurred only in localities at the boundaries of major drainages, likely reflecting secondary contact of previously allopatric populations. Extensive population expansion probably occurred early in the Middle Pleistocene accompanying dramatic climatic oscillations.

AB Global climate change is of particular concern for small and isolated populations of reptiles with temperature-dependent sex determination because low genetic variation can limit adaptive response in pivotal temperatures, leading to skewed sex ratios. We explore the demographic consequences of skewed sex ratios on the viability of a tuatara population characterized by low genetic diversity. We studied the rare species of tuatara (Sphenodon guntheri) on the 4 ha North Brother Island in New Zealand over two nesting seasons and captured 477 individuals, with a 60% male bias in the adult population. Females first breed at 15 years and have extremely low rates of gravidity, producing clutches of three to eight eggs every 9 years. Simulations of the population using population viability analysis showed that the current population is expected to persist for at least 2000 years at hatchling sex ratios of up to 75% male, but populations with 85% male hatchlings are expected to become extinct within approximately 300 years (some eight generations). Incorporation of inbreeding depression increased the probability of extinction under male biased sex ratios, with no simulated populations surviving at hatchling sex ratios >75% male. Because recent models have predicted that climate change could lead to the production of all male S. guntheri hatchlings by 2085, we examined whether periodic intervention to produce mixed or female biased sex ratios would allow the population to survive if only males were produced in natural nests. We show that intervention every 2-3 years could buffer the effects of climate change on population sex ratios, but translocation to cooler environs might be more cost-effective. Climate change threatens tuatara populations because neither modified nesting behaviour nor adaptive response of the pivotal temperature can modify hatchling sex ratios fast enough in species with long generation intervals.

AB This study aimed to compare canopy herbivore diversity and resultant insect damage to vegetation in two distinct and adjacent ecosystems, specifically a dry forest ecosystem and a cerrado (savanna) ecosystem that occur together in an abrupt transition zone in southeastern Brazil. In the dry forest, the canopy was reached using a single rope climbing technique, whereas the shorter canopy of the cerrado was assessed using a 7 m ladder. Insect specimens were collected by beating the foliage, and 20 representative leaves were collected to calculate the specific leaf mass (SLM) and leaf area loss through herbivory. Also, we collected ten soil samples from each habitat to determine soil nutrient content. We sampled 118 herbivorous insects from ten families, mostly in dry forest trees (96 individuals belonging to 31 species). A higher abundance of chewing and sap-sucking insects were observed in dry forest trees than in cerrado trees. The same pattern was observed for the richness of chewers, with a higher degree of diversity of chewers found in dry forest trees than in cerrado trees. Herbivorous insects were not affected by SLM regardless of guild and habitat. However, we observed a negative correlation between the herbivory rate and the specific leaf mass (SLM). The cerrado trees showed a higher SLM and lower herbivory rates than trees occurring in the dry forest. These results suggest that herbivory rates in the transition dry forest-cerrado may be driven by soil nutrient content, which is thought to influence leaf sclerophylly.

AB Many forest communities possess considerable knowledge of the natural resources they use. Such knowledge can potentially inform scientific approaches to management, either as a source of baseline data to fill information gaps that cannot otherwise be addressed or to provide alternative management approaches from which scientists and managers might learn. In general, however, little attention has been given to the relevance of quantitative forms of such knowledge for resource management. Much discussion has focused on the integration of traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) into management, but less attention has been paid to identifying specific areas where it is most useful and where it may be most problematic. We contrasted scientific data with information from TEK in the context of a threat to the sustainable harvesting of a nontimber forest product (NTFP) of livelihood importance in southern India, specifically, a fruit tree infected by mistletoe. The efficiency of deriving information from NTFP harvesters compared to scientific field studies was assessed. We further evaluated the potential of TEK to provide novel solutions to the management problem in question, the degree to which TEK could provide quantitative information, and the biases that might be associated with information derived from TEK. TEK complemented previously gathered ecological data by providing concordant and additional information, but also contradicted some results obtained using a scientific approach. TEK also gave a longer-term perspective with regard to NTFP harvesting patterns. Combining information on historical and current harvesting trends for the NTFP with official data suggests that current assessments of sustainability may be inaccurate and that the use of diverse information sources may provide an effective approach to assessing the status of harvested resources.

AB We have used phylogeographic analysis of mitochondrial DNA (COI and COII genes) and ecological niche modelling (ENM) to reconstruct the population history of Argosarchus horridus (White), a widespread species of New Zealand stick insect. These data were used to address outstanding questions on the role of glacial refugia in determining the distribution and genetic structure of New Zealand species. Phylogeographic analysis shows a general pattern of high diversity in upper North Island and reduced diversity in lower North Island and South Island. The ENM indicates that during the last glacial maximum, A. horridus was largely restricted to refugia around coastal areas of North Island. The ENM also suggests refugia on the northeast coast of South Island and southeast coast of North Island and this prediction is verified by phylogeographic analysis, which shows a clade restricted to this region. Argosarchus horridus is also most likely a geographic parthenogen where males are much rarer at higher latitudes. The higher levels of genetic variation in northern, bisexual populations suggest southern and largely unisexual populations originated from southwardly expanding parthenogenetic lineages. Bayesian skyline analysis also provides support for a recent population size increase consistent with a large increase in geographic distribution in the late Pleistocene. These results exemplify the utility of integrating ENM and phylogeographic analysis in testing hypotheses on the origin of geographic parthenogenesis and effects of Pleistocene environmental change on biodiversity.

AB We used socioeconomic models that included economic inequality to predict biodiversity loss, measured as the proportion of threatened plant and vertebrate species, across 50 countries. Our main goal was to evaluate whether economic inequality, measured as the Gini index of income distribution, improved the explanatory power of our statistical models. We compared four models that included the following: only population density, economic footprint (i.e., the size of the economy relative to the country area), economic footprint and income inequality (Gini index), and an index of environmental governance. We also tested the environmental Kuznets curve hypothesis, but it was not supported by the data. Statistical comparisons of the models revealed that the model including both economic footprint and inequality was the best predictor of threatened species. It significantly outperformed population density alone and the environmental governance model according to the Akaike information criterion. Inequality was a significant predictor of biodiversity loss and significantly improved the fit of our models. These results confirm that socioeconomic inequality is an important factor to consider when predicting rates of anthropogenic biodiversity loss.

AB The Tibetan Plateau is one of the top 10 biodiversity hotspots in the world and acts as a modern harbour for many rare species because of its relatively pristine state. In this article, we report a landscape genetic study on the Yunnan snub-nosed monkey (Rhinopithecus bieti), a primate endemic to the Tibetan Plateau. DNA was extracted from blood, tissue and fecal samples of 135 wild individuals representing 11 out of 15 extant monkey groups. Ten microsatellite loci were used to characterize patterns of genetic diversity. The most striking feature of the population structure is the presence of five subpopulations with distinct genetic backgrounds and unique spatial regions. The population structure of R. bieti appears to be shaped by anthropogenic landscape features as gene flow between subpopulations is strongly impeded by arable land, highways and human habitation. A partial Mantel test showed that 36.23% (r = 0.51, P = 0.01) of the genetic distance was explained by habitat gaps after controlling for the effect of geographical distance. Only 4.92% of the genetic distance was explained by geographical distance in the partial Mantel test, and no significant correlation was found. Estimation of population structure history indicates that environmental change during the last glacial maximum and human impacts since the Holocene, or a combination of both, have shaped the observed population structure of R. bieti. Increasing human activity on the Plateau, especially that resulting in habitat fragmentation, is becoming an important factor in shaping the genetic structure and evolutionary potential of species inhabiting this key ecosystem.

AB Large carnivores play a key role in the structuring and dynamics of many ecosystems, yet the factors influencing dynamics of carnivore populations themselves are often poorly understood. Spotted hyenas (Crocuta crocuta) are the most abundant large carnivores in many African ecosystems. We describe demographic patterns in a population of spotted hyenas observed continuously for 15.5 years, and assess the effects of per capita prey availability, interspecific competition, rainfall, anthropogenic disturbance, and disease on 2 key determinants of population dynamics: reproduction and survival. Annual reproduction., survival Of juveniles (i.e., recruitment to adulthood), and mortality of adults varied among years of the study. Per capita prey availability and group size both had positive effects on reproduction, whereas interspecific competition with lions had a negative effect. Competition with lions and rainfall both had negative effects on survival Of juveniles. We suggest that the negative effect of rainfall on survival may be mediated by increased rates of human-carnivore conflict during periods of heavy rain, although human population size did not influence survival or reproduction directly. Disease had no substantial effect on this hyena population, despite occurrence of at least 2 disease Outbreaks among sympatric carnivores during the study. By focusing on demographic processes that determine population growth (i.e., survival and reproduction), this study highlights the importance of both top-down and bottom-up forces acting on populations of large carnivores. These findings also add to a growing literature suggesting that interspecific competition may be more important than previously recognized in the dynamics Of Populations of large carnivores.

AB We compared past and current limits of the distribution range of the southern green stink bug, Nezara viridula (L.) (Heteroptera: Pentatomidae), in central Japan. In the early 1960s, the northern limit of the range was in Wakayama Prefecture and was limited by a +5 degrees C isothermal line for the mean January temperature. In 2006-2007, a new survey demonstrated that this northern limit had shifted northwards by 85 km (i.e., at a mean rate of 19.0 km per decade). The shift was most likely promoted by milder winter conditions. The mean January to February temperature in the region was 1.03-1.91 degrees C higher in 1998-2007 than in 1960-1969. The number of cold days (with the mean temperature below +5 degrees C) also significantly decreased, while the annual lowest temperature significantly increased. Nezara viridula was found mostly close to those locations where (i) the mean January temperature exceeded +5 degrees C, (ii) the mean number of cold days did not exceed 26 in January to February, and (iii) where the mean annual lowest temperature did not drop below -3.0 degrees C. The general linear model shows that the mean January temperature and number of cold days are the most important factors controlling the northern limit of distribution of N. viridula. All the climatic data suggest that over the last 45 years, environmental conditions have become more favourable for overwintering of N. viridula at many locations in central Japan. This has probably promoted the northward spread of the species, representing a direct response to climate warming. A sympatrically distributed congeneric, Nezara antennata Scott, seems to respond to the warming by a retreat from the ocean coast towards cooler elevated habitats, which might be a complex response to elevated temperature and interspecific mating with N. viridula. It is suggested that the range changes in both species will continue in response to further climate change.

AB Effects of fertilization and irrigation on fine roots and fungal hyphae were studied in 13-year-old maritime pine (Pinus pinaster Ait. in Soland), 7 years after the initiation of the treatments. The fertilization trials consisted of a phosphorus treatment, a complete fertilizer treatment (N, P, K, Ca and Mg), and an unfertilized treatment (control). Fertilizers were applied annually and were adjusted according to foliar target values. Two irrigation regimes (no irrigation and irrigation of a Set amount each day) were applied from May to October. Root samples to depths of 120 cm were collected in summer of 2005, and the biomass of small roots (diameter 2-20 mm) and fine roots (diameter <= 2 mm) and fine root morphology were assessed. Biomass and length of hyphae were studied by a mesh ingrowth bag technique. Total fine root biomass in the litter and in the 0-120 cm soil profile ranged between 111 and 296 g m(-2). Results derived from the measurements of biomass and root length, or root area, showed that both fertilizer treatments reduced the size of the fine root system, especially in the top soil layers, but did not affect small roots. Compared with control treatments, fine root morphology was affected by both fertilizer treatments with the fine roots having increased specific root length/area, and irrigation tended to reinforce this finer morphology. The amount of hyphae in the mesh ingrowth bags was higher in the fertilization and irrigation treatments than in the controls, suggesting further extension of the root system (ectomycorrhizal infection) and thus of the uptake system. Irrigation had no significant effect on the size of the fine root system, but resulted in a shallower rooting system. Total root to shoot ratios were unaffected by the treatments, but fine root mass:needle mass and fine root area index:leaf area index ratios decreased with increasing nutrient Supply. Overall, compared with the control fine roots, increased nutrient supply resulted in a lower fine root biomass but the dynamic fraction of the finest roots was greater. Irrigation had only limited effects on fine root size, distribution and morphology.

AB Galeolaria caespitosa Lamarck, 1818 is an endemic, gregarious serpulid annelid, ubiquitous along the intertidal zone of southern Australia, occurring from Queensland to Western Australia. We sampled specimens across this range and utilised morphological features and sequences of mitochondrial (cytochrome-b) and nuclear (ITS2) markers to assess the taxonomic status of this morphospecies. No taxonomically significant morphological differences were observed across the range of G. caespitosa. However, the molecular data revealed the existence of the following two well supported clades that were also geographically concordant for the two markers: an eastern clade, consisting of New South Wales and southern Queensland samples, and a south-western group that encompassed samples from the rest of its range. The minimum pairwise distance between members of the two groups was more than 24% for cytochrome-b, with a maximum of 1% within-group variation. In addition, analysis of molecular variation showed a high proportion ( 97%) of the total variation distributed among the two groups, indicative of long-term isolation of the two clades. These results suggest that G. caespitosa comprises at least two cryptic species. Here, we discuss the merits of naming new Galeolaria species, given there were no consistent morphological differences detectable and the absence of details on the type locality for G. caespitosa. We conclude that a new species of Galeolaria is warranted and describe it here as G. gemineoa.

   CONSEQUENCES
AB The critically endangered Madagascar fish-eagle (Haliaeetus vociferoides) is considered to be one of the rarest birds of prey globally and at significant risk of extinction. In the most recent census, only 222 adult individuals were recorded with an estimated total breeding population of no more than 100-120 pairs. Here, levels of Madagascar fish-eagle population genetic diversity based on 47 microsatellite loci were compared with its sister species, the African fish-eagle (Haliaeetus vocifer), and 16 of these loci were also characterized in the white-tailed eagle (Haliaeetus albicilla) and the bald eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus). Overall, extremely low genetic diversity was observed in the Madagascar fish-eagle compared to other surveyed Haliaeetus species. Determining whether this low diversity is the result of a recent bottleneck or a more historic event has important implications for their conservation. Using a Bayesian coalescent-based method, we show that Madagascar fish-eagles have maintained a small effective population size for hundreds to thousands of years and that its low level of neutral genetic diversity is not the result of a recent bottleneck. Therefore, efforts made to prevent Madagascar fish-eagle extinction should place high priority on maintenance of habitat requirements and reducing direct and indirect human persecution. Given the current rate of deforestation in Madagascar, we further recommend that the population be expanded to occupy a larger geographical distribution. This will help the population persist when exposed to stochastic factors (e.g. climate and disease) that may threaten a species consisting of only 200 adult individuals while inhabiting a rapidly changing landscape.

AB Aim To improve our understanding of species range limits by studying how height growth, a trait related to plant survival, varies throughout the geographic range of Fagus sylvatica L. in France.
   Location The geographic range of beech in France, representing the western area of its European distribution, within which this species exhibits range distribution limits in both plains and mountainous areas.
   Methods A generalized linear regression model was used to link beech growth performance to environmental variables using data from 819 plots of the French National Forest Inventory (IFN) database. This model was applied to predict potential growth on 97,281 IFN plots covering the geographic range of beech in France. A kriging technique was used to interpolate estimated growth potential. Finally, the performance of plot-based predictions of potential growth from the map (i.e. map quality) was evaluated against an independent data set.
   Results The beech growth performance model highlighted the major impact of climate on potential tree growth at a broad spatial scale. The relevant climatic factors were related mainly to spring cold, summer heat, and winter temperatures and rainfall. The study also revealed the predictive power of soil parameters, which explained a large proportion of the variation in potential beech growth (c. 30%). Analyses of height growth patterns near the boundary of the species range in France showed that the limit only partly coincides with the growth decline caused by climatic and soil factors. Along parts of the range limit, the predicted potential for growth was high, suggesting that in these areas the limit of the range could be explained by other factors, such as competition or constraints on reproduction.
   Main conclusions The spatial variation in the potential height growth of Fagus sylvatica can be explained by environmental factors and is partly correlated with its regional range limits. By identifying areas where growth potential constrains the geographic range of species, environmental growth models can help to improve our knowledge of the spatial drivers of species geographic range limits and shed light on their response to future environmental changes.

AB In small and fragmented populations, genetic diversity may be reduced owing to increased levels of drift and inbreeding. This reduced diversity is often associated with decreased fitness and a higher threat of extinction. However, it is difficult to determine when a population has low diversity except in a comparative context. We assessed genetic variability in the critically endangered Cross River gorilla (Gorilla gorilla diehli), a small and fragmented population, using 11 autosomal microsatellite loci. We show that levels of diversity in the Cross River population are not evenly distributed across the three genetically identified subpopulations, and that one centrally located subpopulation has higher levels of variability than the others. All measures of genetic variability in the Cross River population were comparable to those of the similarly small mountain gorilla (G. beringel beringel) populations (Bwindi and Virunga). However, for some measures both the Cross River and mountain gorilla populations show lower levels of diversity than a sample from a large, continuous western gorilla population (Mondika, G. gorilla gorilla). Finally, we tested for the genetic signature of a bottleneck in each of the four populations. Only Cross River showed strong evidence of a reduction in population size, suggesting that the reduction in size of this population was more recent or abrupt than in the two mountain gorilla populations. These results emphasize the need for maintaining connectivity in fragmented populations and highlight the importance of allowing small populations to expand.

AB Understanding long-term climatic variability is basic to wise management and conservation of biodiversity. We analysed temporal variations in the local rainfall, temperature, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index and the hemispheric El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), using the Southern Oscillation Index and how they co varied in the Mara-Serengeti ecosystem of Kenya and Tanzania. Local rainfall showed a striking temporal variability and an evident 5-year quasi-periodicity in the ecosystem. Severe droughts were a recurrent/persistent feature of the ecosystem but extreme floods were relatively infrequent. The timings of droughts and floods coincided with strong episodes in the activities of the ENSO phenomenon. Above-average rainfall often accompanied cold ENSO episodes and below-average rainfall warm ENSO events, contrary to past generalizations suggesting that warm ENSO events are only associated with above-average rainfall whereas cold ENSO events with below-average rainfall in equatorial East Africa. Both minimum and maximum temperatures were below-normal during cold ENSO episodes and above-normal during warm ENSO events. Rising temperatures and declining rainfall throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, with unprecedently prolonged and strong ENSO episodes, engendered progressive habitat desiccation and reduction in vegetation production in the ecosystem. This exacerbated the debilitating effects of adverse weather on local plant and animal communities, resulting in high mortalities of ungulates.

AB Use of food resources by herbivores depends on intrinsic constraints, essentially body size and morpho-physiological characteristics, which determine the range of foods they tolerate and environmental constraints, such as seasonality and interspecific interactions, which determine the availability of resources. We analysed a collection of rumen contents samples from sympatric populations of red deer Cervus elaphus and roe deer Capreolus capreolus and tested several theoretical predictions relating to the impact of intrinsic and environmental constraints on diet composition, diversity and similarity. Red deer consumed more slowly digestible, fibrous forage than roe deer and had a more diverse diet throughout the year, which supports predictions deriving from specific body size and morpho-physiological characteristics. In conformity with the optimal foraging theory, both species consumed more slowly digestible forage in times of low food availability (i.e. during winter) than during the rest of the year. An increase in diet similarity in winter, along with predictions from the theory on competitive interaction processes, led us to assume that food resources were not limiting and that exploitative competition between red and roe deer was unlikely in our study area. We underline the importance of studies of the use of food resources by sympatric herbivores in answering applied ecological questions at the local scale, and we suggest that the Euclidean geometrical approach we used is particularly well suited for the analysis of resource matrices, a common end-product of long-term field data gathering on the feeding habits of animals.

AB The purposes of this article are to quantify the relationship between epiphytic lichen distribution and macroclimatic variables in the study area and to provide a case study for evaluating the predictive role of epiphytic lichens as bioclimatic indicators. The study was carried out in the Liguria region (NW-Italy), a small (5432 km(2)) borderline area, where phytoclimatic features range from the dry Mediterranean to the Alpine in a few kilometers. Epiphytic lichen diversity was sampled using a standardized protocol [Asta et al (2002) In: Nimis et al (eds) Monitoring with lichens: monitoring lichens. Kluwer, Dordrecht]. Abundance of the species in the sampling sites was related to macroclimatic parameters (yearly average temperature and rainfall) and non-parametric multivariate models were calculated to find significative relationships among predictive and response variables. A total of 59 species showed highly significant relation with macroclimatic parameters. Four groups were selected, by means of a cluster analysis, related to four climatic niches (warm-humid, cold-humid, mesothermic-humid, warm-dry). Distributional pattern of the groups in the survey area showed a good correspondence with the bioclimatic units of Liguria region described by Nimis [(2003) Checklist of the Lichens of Italy 3.0. University of Trieste, Dept of Biology. http://www.dbiodbs.univ.trieste.it. Cited 1 Jun 2006]. A significant subset of epiphytic lichen species in the study area have been proved to be efficient bioclimatic indicator and it is supposed to give good results to monitor climatic changes, in a long-term perspective.

AB The paleoendemic opilionid Fumontana deprehendor is restricted to a small area of mid-elevation forested habitats in the southern Blue Ridge province of the Appalachian Mountains. In a recent study we reported on the discovery of 22 new montane populations of this monotypic genus, specimens from which exhibit remarkably little morphological divergence despite their separation by intervening lowlands and large riverine barriers. Here, we further explore spatial and temporal patterns of divergence in this taxon using DNA sequence data from a portion of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene (similar to 1000 bp) and full-length sequences of both nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer regions, including the intervening 5.8S rRNA region (similar to 700 bp total). Bayesian phylogenetic analyses of these independent data sets reveal congruent genealogical patterns, with all data partitioning and combination strategies consistently recovering five allopatric, geographically cohesive genetic clades. These clades show an almost complete lack of internal genetic divergence, with most individuals sharing a clade-specific, regionally widespread haplotype. The geographic distribution of these clades corresponds to patterns seen in other upland taxa of the region, possibly indicating coincident vicariance. Because of a lack of quantifiable morphological divergence and relatively modest levels of genetic divergence, we conservatively refer to the geographically cohesive genetic clades as "phylogeographic units", although these may actually represent cryptic species. Conservation implications and the prospect for future comparative arachnid phylogeography in the southern Appalachians are discussed in light of the results presented here. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

AB Inbreeding causes reduction of genetic variability that may have severe fitness consequences. In spite of its potentially huge impact on viability and evolutionary processes especially in small populations, quantitative demonstrations of genetic and demographic effects of inbreeding in natural populations are few. Here, we examine the relationship between individual inbreeding coefficients (F) and individual standardized multilocus heterozygosity (H) in an insular metapopulation of house sparrows (Passer domesticus) in northern Norway in order to evaluate whether H is a good predictor for F. We then relate variation in fitness (i.e. the probability of surviving from fledging to recruitment) to F and H, which enables us to examine whether inbreeding depression is associated with a reduction in genetic variability. The average level of inbreeding in the house sparrow metapopulation was high, and there was large inter-individual variation in F. As expected, standardized multilocus heterozygosity decreased with the level of inbreeding. The probability of recruitment was significantly negatively related to F, and, accordingly, increased with H. However, H explained no significant additional variation in recruitment rate than was explained by F. This suggests that H is a good predictor for F in this metapopulation, and that an increase in F is likely to be associated with a general increase in the level of homozygosity on loci across the genome, which has severe fitness consequences.

AB Little is known about the effect of hormones on the photosynthetic process. Therefore, we studied Rubisco content and expression along with gas exchange parameters in transgenic tobacco ( Nicotiana tabacum) plants that are not able to sense ethylene. We also tested for a possible interaction between ethylene insensitivity, abscisic acid (ABA), and sugar feedback on photosynthesis. We measured Rubisco content in seedlings grown in agar with or without added sugar and fluridone, and Rubisco expression in hydroponically grown vegetative plants grown at low and high CO2. Furthermore, we analyzed gas exchange and the photosynthetic machinery of transformants and wild-type plants grown under standard conditions. In the presence of exogenous glucose (Glc), agar-grown seedlings of the ethylene-insensitive genotype had lower amounts of Rubisco per unit leaf area than the wild type. No differences in Rubisco content were found between ethylene-insensitive and wild-type seedlings treated with fluridone, suggesting that inhibition of ABA production nullified the effect of Glc application. When larger, vegetative plants were grown at different atmospheric CO2 concentrations, a negative correlation was found between Glc concentration in the leaves and Rubisco gene expression, with stronger repression by high Glc concentrations in ethylene-insensitive plants. Ethylene insensitivity resulted in plants with comparable fractions of nitrogen invested in light harvesting, but lower amounts in electron transport and Rubisco. Consequently, photosynthetic capacity of the insensitive genotype was clearly lower compared with the wild type. We conclude that the inability to perceive ethylene results in increased sensitivity to Glc, which may be mediated by a higher ABA concentration. This increased sensitivity to endogenous Glc has negative consequences for Rubisco content and photosynthetic capacity of these plants.

AB We investigated patterns of genetic variation within and among the eight extant populations of the genus Abies in the western Mediterranean Basin. Using six chloroplast microsatellite (cpSSR) loci, a total of 22 alleles and 34 haplotypes was found among 225 individuals. The analyzed populations showed high levels of genetic diversity (mean H-e = 0.84). Two clearly separated main groups corresponding to the three Spanish and the five Moroccan populations, respectively, were distinguished. A phylogeographic signal was evident and a Mantel test revealed a strong positive correlation between geographic and genetic distances of the eight populations. Analysis of Molecular Variance (AMOVA) assigned 85% of the total genetic variation to differences between continents. Within each continent, populations were remarkably little differentiated with the exception of one highly divergent Moroccan stand; the origin of this divergence requires further investigation. Our results document a strong effect of the Strait of Gibraltar on Abies differentiation in this region, whereas the high diversity within and the low differentiation among populations on each side point to a certain level of pollen-mediated gene flow among the extant stands. On the other hand, our analysis indicates that the population formerly assigned to the species A. tazaotana is, in fact, genetically very close to mostA. marocana stands. We discuss implications of the observed population structures for conservation and management of West Mediterranean Abies taxa.

AB A major target for environmental managers when trying to minimise the road-barrier effect on wildlife is to improve permeability to animal movements. Previous studies have demonstrated that drainage culverts are used by vertebrates, although knowledge of the main influencing factors remains limited. The use of 34 culverts from two roads in southern Portugal, differing in traffic volume, vehicle speeds and configuration, was evaluated by the analysis of terrestrial vertebrate footprint data (408 passage-operative days). Culvert crossings were related to various explanatory variables by means of canonical ordination techniques. We recorded 901 complete crossings, corresponding to an average of 2.2 crossings/culvert/operative day. Thirteen taxa were detected, all in more than one passage. Animal species included reptiles, small mammals, lagomorphs, carnivores and domestic dogs and cats. Our results suggest that fencing might have a funnelling effect, directing larger animals toward culverts. Also, vegetation covering culvert entrances seems to have a positive effect, particularly on genets; longer passages with entrances far from the pavement were, apparently, avoided by smaller animals; a lower number of crossings was detected on passages with detritus pits; the closest passages to urban areas are more often used by domestic species; forest-living species favour passages with low, open land cover nearby; and smaller species, like lagomorphs and small mammals, appear to use more culverts near the pavement, which probably reflects the importance of road verges as refuges for these species. Although not used by all species present in the study area, constructing numerous passages of different sizes without detritus pits and which are distributed along roads might be an important step in mitigating road fragmentation effects on animal populations.

AB Trapped common carp Cyprinus carpio display a pronounced escape behavior of jumping out of the water; this behavior is not exhibited by most Australian native fishes. Hence, there appears to be an important opportunity to exploit the unique jumping behavior of normative common carp to aid selective removal. We report on the Williams cage, a simple device that automatically separates jumping common carp from nonjumping fish. Between November 2002 and April 2005, the Williams cage was tested at Torrumbarry Weir fishway on the Murray River, Victoria, Australia, and trapped fish were counted every 24 h. The Williams cage successfully separated 88% of adult common carp into a confinement area. In contrast, more than 99.9% of 8,031 native fish passed through the Williams cage and exited the fishway. The Williams cage may provide a method for controlling dispersal and abundance of common carp and may be applicable to other nuisance fish species.

AB Aim Over the next 100 years, human-driven climate change and resulting changes in species occurrences will have global impacts on biodiversity, ecosystem function, and human health. Here we examine how climate change may affect the occurrences of tick species in Africa and alter the suitability of habitat outside Africa for African ticks.
   Location Africa and the world.
   Methods We predicted continental and global changes in habitat suitability for each of 73 African tick species, using multiple regression models in different climate change scenarios that cover a wide range of uncertainty.
   Results Global habitat suitability improves for nearly all tick species under each of a representative range of eight climate change scenarios. Depending on the scenario, African tick species experience an average increase in global habitat suitability of between 1 million and 9 million square kilometres between 1990 and 2100.
   Main conclusions The potential for successful translocations of ticks and their pathogens from Africa to the rest of the world is likely to increase over the next 100 years. Although the general trend is one of range expansion, there are winners and losers among tick species in each scenario, suggesting that tick community composition will be disrupted substantially by climate change. If this is also typical of other invertebrates, then climate change will disrupt not only the geographic location of communities but also their structure. Changes in tick communities are also likely to influence tick-borne pathogens.

AB Heterotachy occurs when the relative evolutionary rates among sites are not the same across lineages. Sequence alignments are likely to exhibit heterotachy with varying severity because the intensity of purifying selection and adaptive forces at a given amino acid or DNA sequence position is unlikely to be the same in different species. In a recent study, the influence of heterotachy on the performance of different phylogenetic methods was examined using computer simulation for a four-species phylogeny. Maximum parsimony (MP) was reported to generally outperform maximum likelihood (ML). However, our comparisons of MP and ML methods using the methods and evaluation criteria employed in that study, but considering the possible range of proportions of sites involved in heterotachy, contradict their findings and indicate that, in fact, ML is significantly superior to MP even under heterotachy.

AB Of the numerous factors affecting rice yield, how solar radiation is transformed into biomass through rice leaves is the most important. We have analyzed proteomic changes in rice leaves collected from six different developing stages (vegetative to ripening). We studied protein expression profiles of rice leaves by running two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Differential protein expression among the six phases were analyzed by image analysis, which allowed the identification of 49 significantly different gel spots. The spots were further verified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry, in which 89.8% of them were confirmed to be rice proteins. Finally, we confirmed some of the interesting rice proteins by immunoblotting. Three major conclusions can be drawn from these experimental results. (i) Protein expression in rice leaves, at least for high or middle abundance proteins, is attenuated during growth (especially some chloroplast proteins). However, the change is slow and the expression profiles are relatively stable during rice development. (ii) Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO), a major protein in rice leaves, is expressed at constant levels at different growth stages. Interestingly, a high ratio of degradation of the RuBisCO large subunit was found in all samples. This was confirmed by two approaches, mass spectrometry and immunoblotting. The degraded fragments are similar to other digested products of RuBisCO mediated by free radials. (iii) The expression of antioxidant proteins such as superoxide dismutase and peroxidase decline at the early ripening stage.

AB Unlike many regions in the world where wild pigs (Sus scrofa) are threatened, in Australia they are a significant invasive species. As such, the molecular ecology of feral pigs was investigated to understand their social and population genetic structure. Samples from 269 adult animals were collected over their distribution ill southwestern Australia. Using 14 highly polymorphic microsatellite markers, we identified 7 inferred feral pig populations that had moderate heterozygosity (mean = 0.580) and displayed a high level of differentiation (mean R-ST = 0.180). In revealing the genetic structure of feral pigs, we detected anomalies in the pi native origin of some individuals. Samples from these animals were collected from 2 main areas: recently colonized regions that were previously uninfested, and established feral pig populations, where animals from geographically isolated areas had been introduced. In the latter, these corresponded to areas that were in close proximity to public road access and towns. Given the large distances immigrants were found from their population of origin (from 50 to > 400 km), the generally low levels of dispersal of southwest feral pigs, and the grouping and sex of these pigs, we suggest that these individuals have been deliberately and illegally translocated to supplement recreational hunting stocks. Additionally, we could not detect any genetic contribution in these feral pigs from domestic pig herds, suggesting that the deliberate release of domestic pigs to restock feral Populations is relatively uncommon. Our molecular data allowed some inferences regarding the Success or lack thereof of current, management practices, and offered considerable insights into the dynamics of the feral pig populations and identification of "new" approaches that may allow for better control of this highly destructive species.

AB One of the main goals in nature conservation and land use planning is to identify areas important for biodiversity. One possible cost-effective surrogate for deriving appropriate estimates of spatial patterns of species richness is provided by predictive modeling based on remote sensing and topographic data. Using bird species richness data from a spatial grid system (105 squares of 0.25 km(2) within an area of 26.25 km(2)), we tested the usefulness of Landsat TM satellite-based remote sensing and topographic data in bird species richness modeling in a boreal agricultural-forest mosaic in southwestern Finland. We built generalized linear models for the bird species richness and validated the accuracy of the models with an independent test area of 50 grid squares (12.5 km(2)). We evaluated separately the modeling performance of habitat structure, habitat composition, topographical-moisture variables and all variables in the model-building and model-test areas.
   Areas of high observed and predicted bird species richness in the boreal agricultural-forest mosaic were mainly concentrated along river valleys in the grid squares with a high habitat diversity and steep topography. This landscape type also has the highest cover of habitats important for nature conservation: seminatural grasslands, deciduous forests, and watercourses. The covers of deciduous forests and serninatural grassland were included as explanatory variables of the bird species richness model, although they both cover only about 5% of the land in the study area. When the four models were evaluated by fitting them to the model test area, the explanatory power of the topography-moisture model decreased clearly, whereas the habitat-composition, habitat-structure, and all-variables models were more rigorous. Finally, we extrapolated the models to the whole study area of 600 km(2) and produced bird species richness probability maps using GIS techniques.
   We conclude that, instead of scattered study plots in which birds are counted, predictive modeling requires large study areas where the variation within the whole landscape can be taken into account. A spatial grid system with several environmental variables derived from remote sensing data produces the most reliable data sets, which can be used when predicting species richness in other landscapes.

AB 1. Assemblages of phytophagous beetles on Acacia were examined along a 1150 km latitudinal gradient in eastern Australia to investigate the potential effects of climate change on insect communities. The latitudinal gradient was used as a surrogate for differences in temperature. Several possible confounding variables were held constant by selecting comparable sites and emphasising a single host-plant species.
   2. Total species richness increased towards the tropics, but there were no significant differences among latitudes for average species density, species richness, Fisher's alpha, or average Chao-1 index.
   3. Beetles sampled along the gradient were classified into four climate change response groups, depending on their latitudinal range and apparent host specificity: cosmopolitan species, generalist feeders, climate generalists, and specialists. These four groups might respond differently to shifting climate zones. Cosmopolitan species (22% of community, found at more than one latitude and on more than one host plant) may be resilient to climate change. Generalist feeders (16%, found only at one latitude but found on more than one Acacia species) may well feed on several species but will have to move with their climatic envelope. Climate generalists (6%, found only on Acacia falcata but found at more than one latitude) may be constrained by the host species' ability to either cope with the changing climate or move with it. Finally, specialists (55%, found only on A. falcata and at only one latitude) may be forced to move poleward concurrently with their host species, or go extinct.
   4. The analyses indicate that community structure may be fairly resilient to temperature change. The displacement or local extinction of species, especially the species that are found at only one latitude and on only one host plant, however, may lead to significant changes in community composition.

AB Prominent models of herbivore regulation focus on predators, low plant biomass, or poor resource quality as factors that limit herbivore populations. We examined predictions of these tritrophic models for herbivores on the understory shrub, Piper cenocladum, which is defended by mutualistic ants (Pheidole bicornis) and three amide secondary metabolites. To examine sources of variation in P. cenocladum amide content and to compare the effects of amides vs. ants on herbivores, we used three linked experiments in the field and in shadehouses. We manipulated light, nutrient availability, and presence of symbionts for experimental plant fragments and shrubs and then quantified leaf amide concentration. We also examined relationships between amide content and damage by the three most common groups of folivores on P. cenocladum: generalist orthopterans, specialist coleopterans, and specialist lepidopterans. For all experiments, enhanced resources and absence of symbionts caused higher levels of amides. These increased chemical defenses had strong effects on generalist herbivores in this system, while the ant predators were more effective at depressing herbivory by specialists. The negative effects of amides on specialist lepidopterans were small, suggesting that these herbivores are adapted to chemical defenses in their host plant. It is possible that our results are part of a more general trend where top-down effects are stronger against specialist herbivores, while chemical defenses are more effective against generalists. We concluded that different models of herbivore regulation were supported by components of the P. cenocladum arthropod community, depending on resource availability and on the portion of the web examined.

AB Photosynthetic rate, nitrogen concentration and morphological properties of canopy leaves were studied in 18 trees, comprising five dipterocarp species, in a tropical rain forest in Sarawak, Malaysia. Photosynthetic rate at light saturation (P..) differed significantly across species, varying from 7 to 18 mumol m(-2) s(-1). Leaf nitrogen concentration and morphological properties, such as leaf blade and palisade layer thickness, leaf mass per area (LMA) and surface area of mesophyll cells per unit leaf area (A(mes)/A), also varied significantly across species. Among the relationships with leaf characteristics, P-max had the strongest correlation with leaf mesophyll parameters, such as palisade cell layer thickness (r(2) = 0.76, P < 0.001) and A(mes)/A (r(2) =0.73, P<0.001). Leaf nitrogen concentration and P.. per unit area also had a significant but weaker correlation (r(2) = 0.46, P < 0.01), whereas P-max had no correlation, or only weakly significant correlations, with leaf blade thickness and LMA. Shorea beccariana Burck, which had the highest P-max of the species studied, also had the thickest palisade layer, with up to five or more layers. We conclude that interspecific variation in photosynthetic capacity in tropical rain forest canopies is influenced more by leaf mesophyll structure than by leaf thickness, LMA or leaf nitrogen concentration.

AB Small patches of natural or semi-natural habitat have an important role in the conservation of biodiversity in human-dominated environments. The values of such areas are determined by attributes of the patch as well as its context in the surrounding land mosaic. There is a need for better understanding of the ways in which assemblages are influenced by patch context and the scale over which this occurs. Here we examine the influence of regional environmental gradients on the richness, annual turnover and composition of breeding bird species in small woods in south-eastern England. Regional gradients were defined independently of woods by an ordination of attributes for 5 km x 5 km landscape units across a 2100 km(2) region. Patch-level attributes, particularly area, were the most important predictors for most bird variables. For woodland migrants and woodland-dependent species, variables representing the context of each wood, either at a local or regional scale, explained significant additional variance in species richness after accounting for wood area, but did not do so for species turnover. Significant context effects for woodland-dependent species related to the extent of hedges and woodland cover in the local vicinity (<1 km radius), whereas for woodland seasonal migrants the best predictors of richness after patch area were two regional environmental gradients. The initial cue to settlement for migrants may be at a coarse regional scale, with selection for suitable landscapes that have a greater extent of woodland cover. Edge species showed different responses: they were influenced by the diversity of structural features in woods, and were a more-dominant component of the avifauna in isolated woods in open fenland environments of the region. Significant relationships between coarse regional gradients (25 km(2) units) and bird assemblages in small woods (0.5-30 ha) suggest that population and community processes in the avifauna operate across a broader scale than local patch neighbourhoods. They also highlight the importance of adopting a landscape or regional perspective on potential changes to land-use in rural environments, and on the conservation management of small reserves.

AB We measured seasonal variation in area-based nitrogen concentration (N), maximum rate of carboxylation (V-cmax) and maximum rate of electron transport (J(max)) in I-year-old needles along four first-order branches within a Pinus densiflora Sieb. & Zucc. crown, and analyzed their relationships to growth irradiance and temperature. Each leaf light environment was expressed as a ratio of the monthly mean of daily integrated photosynthetically active irradiance (I-int) for the particular needle to I-int above the canopy (I-rel). Needle N decreased in the upper crown during the development of new needles, whereas it remained fairly constant in the lower crown, reflecting differences between upper and lower crown needles in their contribution to the nitrogen of new needles. Gradients of N within the crown were correlated with I-rel in all seasons (r(2) = 0.40-0.78). Seasonal variation in N was weakly correlated with mean daily air minimum temperatures. Both V-cmax and J(max) showed seasonal variation in all first-order branches, and decreased to their lowest values in winter. The gradients of V-cmax and J(max) within the crown were not correlated with I-rel in some seasons, but were correlated with changes in N in most months(r(2) = 0.33-0.75), except in the winter. Furthermore, the regression slope of the relationship between N and V-cmax and the temperature response of V-cmax and J(max) exhibited seasonal variation.

AB As pointed out in Stuart Hurlbert's recent article, ecologists still at times design their experiments sloppily, creating a situation where various forms of 'non-demonic intrusion' could account for the documented contrasts between treatments and controls. If such contrasts are nevertheless presented to the reader as if they were statistically demonstrated treatment effects, then pseudoreplication is not a pseudoissue and the use of a stigmatizing label of is entirely warranted, as pointed out by Hurlbert. The problems with Hurlbert's concepts start in the context of studies, where the scope of the experiment is to provoke a chain of dramatic and a priori extremely unlikely events, which a given conjecture predicts to happen as a consequence of a given manipulation. As the essence of these experiments is to trigger large dynamical responses in a biological system, they often require much space and/or special conditions, allowing for efficient isolation of the experimental system from potential sources of contamination. These constraints can be incompatible with standard designs (randomization, replication and treatment-control interspersion). In the context of experiments, where it has been necessary to sacrifice randomization, replication or treatment-control interspersion, the logic of inferring treatment effects is the same as used when interpreting causes of spontaneous events or events triggered by manipulations with practical purposes. The observed contrasts can be reasonably interpreted as effects of the treatment if and only if their magnitudes and the timing of their emergence makes alternative explanations utterly implausible (which is up to the reader to judge). If the logic of inference is clearly explained and no claim of statistically demonstrated treatment effect is made, the use of stigmatizing labels like 'pseudoreplication' is unwarranted. However, it might clarify the literature if such imperfectly designed experiments are referred to as experimental events, to be distinguished from perfectly designed experiments, where mechanical interpretation of contrasts between treatments and controls as treatment effects can be regarded as socially acceptable.

AB Vertebrates originated in the lower Cambrian. Their diversification and morphological innovations have been attributed to large-scale gene or genome duplications at the origin of the group. These duplications are predicted to have occurred in two rounds, the "2R" hypothesis, or they may have occurred in one genome duplication plus many segmental duplications, although these hypotheses are disputed. Under such models, most genes that are duplicated in all vertebrates should have originated during the same period. Previous work has shown that indeed duplications started after the speciation between vertebrates and the closest invertebrate, amphioxus, but have not set a clear ending. Consideration of chordate phylogeny immediately shows the key position of cartilaginous vertebrates (Chondrichthyes) to answer this question. Did gene duplications occur as frequently during the 45 Myr between the cartilaginous/bony vertebrate split and the fish/tetrapode split as in the previous approximately 100 Myr? Although the time interval is relatively short, it is crucial to understanding the events at the origin of vertebrates. By a systematic appraisal of gene phylogenies, we show that significantly more duplications occurred before than after the cartilaginous/bony vertebrate split. Our results support rounds of gene or genome duplications during a limited period of early vertebrate evolution and allow a better characterization of these events.

AB Water loss from stream ecosystems has profound effects on primary producers. The small body of literature on algal responses to desiccation has emphasized mechanisms of resistance to desiccation, recovery of metabolic activity upon rewetting, and small spatial scales. Unfortunately, small-scale patterns are difficult to interpret because of the high degree of variability in both hydrologic patterns of drying and ecological processes within individual drainage basins. Consequently, effects of drying are best examined at larger spatial scales because variation that appears random at smaller scales become incorporated into larger, more predictable patterns across an entire catchment. We present a conceptual model of the effects of water loss on primary producers applicable to the scale of the entire catchment. This perspective describes differences in susceptibility to water loss, and differential rates of decline and recovery in primary production as a function of location within the catchment. Future considerations of drying on ecosystem attributes such as primary production will be facilitated by treating streams as patchy, interconnected landscapes in space and time and recognizing spatially explicit effects of disturbance. It is likely that streams of different regions vary widely in terms of the occurrence of drought, the geophysical template, and response variables (types of organisms present and their collective metabolism). The challenge in drought research today is to determine what phenomena are general and of widespread application and which are peculiar to given regions.

AB Plants of cassava ( Manihot esculenta Crantz cv. Cigana Preta) grown in a sand root medium were watered with nutrient solutions containing either 3 mM nitrate (low N) or 12 mM nitrate (high N). Chlorophyll concentration, chlorophyll a/b ratio, stomatal conductance, photorespiration rate and net carbon assimilation rate ( on an area and a mass basis, but not on a chlorophyll basis) all decreased in low-N plants as compared with high-N ones. By contrast, photosynthetic nitrogen-use efficiency increased in low-N plants. As indicated by chlorophyll a fluorescence data, these plants exhibited increases in both excitation pressure on Photosystem II and thermal energy dissipation, with a corresponding decrease in quantum yield of electron transport, when contrasted with high-N plants. This decrease paralleled an unchanged maximal Photosystem II photochemical efficiency, suggesting a down-regulation of the Photosystem II photochemistry. It is proposed that decline in biochemical capacity for carboxylation, rather than stomatal limitation or electron transport, were the major constraints associated to the reduced photosynthetic rates induced by nitrogen deficiency in cassava plants.

AB Spatial variation in demographic parameters of the red throat emperor (Lethrinus miniatus) was examined among 12 coral reefs in three geographic regions (Townsville, Mackay, and Storm Cay) spanning over 3degrees of latitude of the Great Barrier Reef, Australia. Estimates of demographic parameters were based on age estimates from counts of annuli in whole otoliths because there was no significant difference in age estimates between whole and sectioned otoliths. There were significant regional differences in age structures, rates of somatic and otolith growth, and total mortality. The Townsville region was characterized by the greatest proportion of older fish, the smallest maximum size, and the lowest rates of otolith growth and total mortality. In contrast the Mackay region was characterized by the highest proportion of younger fish, the largest maximum size, and the highest rates of otolith growth and total mortality. Demographic parameters for the Storm Cay region were intermediate between the other two regions. Historic differences in fishing pressure and regional differences in productivity are two alternative hypotheses given to explain the regional patterns in demographic parameters. All demographic parameters were similar among the four reefs within each region. Thus, subpopulations with relatively homogeneous demographic parameters occurred on scales of reef clusters. Previous studies, by contrast, have found substantial between-reef variation in demographic parameters within regions. Thus spatial variation in demographic parameters for L. miniatus may differ from what is assumed typical for a coral-reef fish metapopulation.

AB The effect of light on the partitioning of resources between photosynthesis and chemical defence was studied in Eucalyptus cladocalyx F. Muell. This species allocates up to 15% of leaf nitrogen to the constitutive cyanogenic glycoside, prunasin, making it an ideal system for studying resource allocation. By controlling the level of leaf nitrogen we were able to test the hypothesis that light limitation would result in the effective reallocation of nitrogen from the defensive to the photosynthetic apparatus. Seedlings were grown in full light or shade and supplied with 1.5 mM or 6 mM nitrogen in a 2x2 factorial design. We found that shading effected a decrease in the concentration of the cyanogenic glycoside, prunasin, and little if any change in the concentration of carbon-based secondary metabolites (total phenolics and condensed tannins). There was also significantly less prunasin, relative to total leaf nitrogen, chlorophyll concentration and carbon assimilation rates, when grown plants were grown in shade, particularly when there was an ample supply of nitrogen. This pattern is likely to be the result of relative changes in the energetic and resource costs of photosynthesis and defensive compounds at different photon flux densities.

AB Females, by mating with more than one male in their lifetime, may reduce their risk of receiving sperm from genetically incompatible sires or increase their prospects of obtaining sperm from genetically superior sires. Although there is evidence of both kinds of genetic benefits in crickets, their relative importance remains unclear, and the extent to which experimentally manipulated levels of polyandry in the laboratory correspond to those that occur in nature remain unknown. We measured lifetime polyandry of free-living female decorated crickets, Gryllodes sigillatus, and conducted an experiment to determine whether polyandry leads to an increase in offspring viability. We experimentally manipulated both the levels of polyandry and opportunities for females to select among males, randomly allocating the offspring of experimental females to high-food-stress or low-food-stress regimes to complete their development. Females exhibited a high degree of polyandry, mating on average with more than seven different males during their lifetime and up to as many as 15. Polyandry had no effect on either the developmental time or survival of offspring. However, polyandrous females produced significantly heavier sons than those of monandrous females, although there was no difference in the adult mass of daughters. There was no significant interaction between mating treatment and offspring nutritional regimen in their effects on offspring mass, suggesting that benefits accruing to female polyandry are independent of the environment in which offspring develop. The sex difference in the extent to which male and female offspring benefit via their mother's polyandry may reflect possible differences in the fitness returns from sons and daughters. The larger mass gain shown by sons of polyandrous females probably leads to their increased reproductive success, either because of their increased success in sperm competition or because of their increased life span.

We examined densities of 4 focal 'species' (Acanthurus spp. [A. bahianus and A. chirurgus], Haemulon spp. [all species of the Haemulon genus], Spalisoma aurofrenatum, and Scarus iserti), and densities of all species combined to determine spatial and temporal patterns of habitat use, Although there was a general tendency for coral reef fishes to use lagoon habitats as nurseries, we discerned 2 patterns of habitat use: I group, exemplified by Acanthurus spp. and Haemulon spp., use lagoon patch-reef and rubble as nurseries in preference to back-reef and other lagoon habitats; in contrast, Sparisoma aurofrenatum and Scarus iserti preferentially use back-reef and, to a lesser extent patch-reef, as nursery, juvenile, and adult habitat. Temporal variation was greatest in the small size class and least in the large size class, Most settlement occurred during summer, which is when settlement in lagoon habitats was greatest, with a little settlement in winter in the back-reef habitat. For species that use lagoons as nurseries, lagoon habitats must provide advantages that offset the additional energy expense and predation experienced by both incoming larvae, as they cross over the reef and search for patch-reef and rubble, and juveniles, as they return to the reef during the juvenile-to-adult transition. Given the use of lagoon habitats as nurseries, there is a need for inclusion of lagoons in coral reef reserves.

ID RESOURCE-MANAGEMENT
AB Two case studies are presented in which models were used as focal tools in problems associated with common-pool resource management in developing countries. In the first case study, based in Zimbabwe, Bayesian or Belief Networks were used in a project designed to enhance the adaptive management capacity of a community in a semiarid rangeland system. In the second case study, based in Senegal, multi-agent systems models were used in the context of role plays to communicate research findings to a community, as well as to explore policies for improved management of rangelands and arable lands over which herders and farmers were in conflict.
   The paper provides examples of the use of computer-based modeling with stakeholders who had limited experience with computer systems and numerical analyses. The paper closes with a brief discussion of the major lessons learned from the two independent case studies. Perhaps the most important lesson was the development of a common understanding of a problem through the development of the models with key stakeholders. A second key lesson was the need for research to be adaptive if it were to benefit adaptive managers. Both case study situations required significant changes in project orientation as stakeholder needs were defined. Both case studies recognized the key role that research, and particularly the development of models, played in bring different actors together to formulate improved management strategies or policies. Participatory engagement with stakeholders is a time-consuming and relatively costly process in which, in the case studies, most of the costs were born by the research projects themselves. We raise the concern that these activities may not be widely replicable if such costs are not reduced or born by the stakeholders themselves.

AB Multiple processes typically influence patterns of abundance. Despite this widely accepted view, many studies continue to approach ecological questions from a single-factor, or, at most. a two-factor perspective. Here, I evaluate the consequences of considering, separately and jointly, the effects of three factors (larval settlement, reef resources, and postsettlement losses) on spatial patterns of abundance of a marine reef fish, the six bar wrasse (Thalassoma hardwicke). Using correlational methods commonly employed in single-factor studies. I show that local patterns of abundance of juvenile wrasse could be attributed entirely to either (1) patterns of abundance of settlement habitat, or (2) patterns of larval settlement. This result occurred because habitat and presumed larval delivery covaried in space. I manipulated abundance of settlement habitat in a field experiment to uncouple this covariation and found subsequent settlement to be simultaneously influenced by both factors. However. joint effects of habitat and settlement failed to account for patterns of abundance of juvenile wrasse without also considering a third factor-postsettlement losses-which were density-dependent and substantially modified patterns of settlement. These results illustrate (1) how multifactorial explanations may be falsely refuted when incomplete sets of multiple factors are considered, and (2) how single-factor explanations may misrepresent underlying multifactorial causation of ecological patterns. Uncovering the interactive role of multiple factors in determining ecological patterns of interest requires a shift from single-factor approaches to more pluralistic perspectives.

AB The Caribbean rock iguana, Cyclura, has had an unstable intrageneric taxonomy and an unclear phylogenetic position within the family Iguanidae. We use mtDNA sequence data to address these issues and explore the phylogeographic history of the genus. ND4 to leucine tRNA sequence data were collected from multiple individuals of each of the eight species of Cyclura (including 15 of 16 subspecies) and from four localities of Iguana iguana (representative of this species' broad geographic range). This data set was combined with sequence data from Sites et al. (1996, Mol. Biol. Evol. 13, 1087-1105) and analyzed under maximum-parsimony and maximum-likelihood optimization criteria. The ND4 region provided good resolution for the majority of nodes, as indicated by high bootstrap support. In agreement with several recent molecular studies, Cyclura is recovered as monophyletic and is not closely related to any other genus, whereas Iguana is strongly supported as the sister taxon to Sauromalus. This result is statistically more likely than other published hypotheses of Iguanid relationships. Cyclura shows a southeast to northwest speciation sequence in the Caribbean, with the most ancient lineage on the Puerto Rican Bank. The amount of interspecific sequence divergence within Cyclura (maximum 11.4%) is very high in comparison to data from other iguanid taxa at this locus, suggesting that this group either has been in the Caribbean for a very long time or has gone through a very rapid rate of evolution at this locus. Using dates from other published studies, we calculate a molecular clock that suggests that Cyclura colonized the Caribbean between 15 and 35 mya. Several questions regarding subspecific taxonomy are raised in the analysis and await further investigation using a more rapidly evolving marker such as nuclear microsatellites.

AB Numerous studies have dealt with the relationship between leaf nitrogen content and leaf irradiance. However, most of them refer to dense stands presenting reduced horizontal heterogeneity of foliage distribution. Both gradients of leaf nitrogen and leaf irradiance related to canopy depth are significant under such conditions, and modelling radiative exchange using a turbid-medium analogy and dividing the canopy into vegetation layers is sufficient. Conversely, row crops such as maize are characterized by strong horizontal heterogeneity of foliage distribution and the one-dimensional (1D) approach may be unsuitable. We thus modelled the three-dimensional (3D) geometry of maize canopies with varying densities and at different developmental stages using plant digitizing under field conditions. The nitrogen content per unit area of each leaf part was obtained subsequently by nitrogen analysis. We next calculated radiative exchange using a 3D volume-based approach within the canopies in order to estimate local leaf irradiance on a daily integration scale. Vertical gradients in leaf nitrogen content per unit area observed in dense stands during the vegetative phase corresponded largely to those reported in the literature. We also identified significant gradients in nitrogen content along the leaves, which had not before been clearly demonstrated. Our study shows that local light climate during plant development plays a major role in leaf nitrogen distribution and remobilization. Moreover, brutal plant thinning involves rapid changes in leaf nitrogen partitioning. It is concluded that taking account of the 3D heterogeneity of nitrogen and irradiance distribution may have implications for modelling crop photosynthesis and production.

AB We investigated how shoot gross morphology and leaf properties are determined in Fagus japonica Maxim., a deciduous species with flush-type shoot phenology, in which all leaves are produced in a single flush at the start of each season. We examined relationships between current-year shoot properties and local light environment in a 14-m tall beech tree growing in a deciduous forest. Leaf number (LN), total leaf area (TLA), and total leaf length (SL) of the current-year shoot increased with increasing photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD). Leaf thickness, dry mass per leaf area and nitrogen content on a leaf area basis increased, whereas the chlorophyll/N ratio decreased with increasing PPFD. To separate the effects of current-year PPFD from those of previous year(s), we artificially shaded a part of the uppermost leaf tier. Reciprocal transfers of beech seedlings between controlled PPFD regimes were also made. Characteristics of shoot gross morphology such as LN, TLA and SL were largely determined by the PPFD of the previous year. The exception was the length of the longest "long shoots" with many leaves, in which elongation appeared to be influenced by both previous-year and current-year PPFD. In contrast, leaf properties were determined by current-year PPFD. The ecological implications of our findings are discussed.

AB Uncertainties regarding the phylogenetic history within the Bivalvia have impeded attempts to understand evolution within the group. Estimating the evolutionary relationships surrounding the Trigonioida has been especially problematic and has led to disparate hypotheses regarding (1) the origin and subsequent diversification of unionoid bivalves and (2) autobranch gill character state transitions. In order to test alternative hypotheses of trigonioid phylogeny, 613 base pairs of DNA sequence of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene were analyzed from 14 species of bivalves (ingroup) and three species of non-bivalve mollusks (outgroup). All phylogenetic analyses, using either nucleotide or inferred amino acid sequences, produced trees that robustly placed Neotrigonia (Trigonioida) as the sister taxon to a monophyletic Unionoida. Furthermore, the Autobranchia, Veneroida, and Mytiloida were supported as monophyletic groups in these analyses, whereas the Bivalvia was not. These phylogenetic relationships suggest that (1) there was a single invasion of freshwater by a unionoid bivalve ancestor, (2) trigonioid rather than veneroid bivalves gave rise to the Unionoida, (3) either the eulamellibranchous or filibranchous gill condition has evolved multiple times within the Autobranchia, and (4) the molluscan bivalved body plan may have evolved more frequently than traditional phylogenetic hypotheses suggest.

AB The larvae of many sessile marine invertebrates are able to locate and settle selectively in physical microrefuges where the survival of the post-larval stage may be enhanced. However, it has been suggested that clonal encrusting organisms with unlimited attachment to the substratum do not rely heavily on microrefuges for post-larval survival, since they quickly outgrow refuges and then suffer partial rather than total mortality. Consequently, the larva of such organisms is predicted to show little selectivity at the time of settlement. This prediction, verified for some bryozoans and ascidians, has also been extrapolated to sponges despite the fact that there is virtually no field information on patterns of settlement and post-settlement mortality in this group. In the present study, we investigated patterns of settlement and juvenile mortality in 2 common Mediterranean encrusting sponges, Crambe crambe and Scopalina lophyropoda. We placed a set of grooved plates (providing microrefuges for larval settle ment) and a set of smooth plates (without refuges) in the natural community, mapped larval settlement on plates at 3 d intervals, and recorded the fate of each settled larva for 10 wk. The total number of larvae of C. crambe that settled on the plates was significantly higher than that of S. lophyropoda, and both species settled preferentially in the microrefuges of the grooved plates. On each of the grooved plates, larvae settled preferentially on the shaded sides of outer ridges, avoiding equivalent ridge sides that were highly exposed to Light. This pattern suggests that microrefuges are located by larvae on the basis of photic cues, The analysis of survival time revealed that survival of post-larval stages protected in grooves was higher in both species compared to unprotected post-larvae. The survival curve of the juveniles did not clearly follow an exponential model. Survival decreased more or less rapidly for the first 2 mo, but the chance of mortality was not markedly higher 1 wk after settlement than during subsequent weeks. Because we could not exert control over the various coincidental mortality factors that affected the sponges settled on the experimental plates, we tested the following hypotheses in the laboratory: (1) that the abundant echinoderms inhabiting these assemblages cause significant mortality by both unselective ingestion and abrasion, and (2) that microrefuges substantially reduce sponge vulnerability to this mortality factor. In this experiment, we investigated differences in mortality among small sponges as a function of microhabitat exploitation (sponges protected in grooves versus unprotected sponges on smooth surfaces) and the presence/absence of potential predators (the sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus, the starfish Echinaster sepositus). It was found that E. sepositus caused negligible mortality, irrespective of sponge microhabitat. In contrast, P. licidus caused significant mortality, indicating that bulldozing by urchins may have substantial negative effects on sponge recruitment in temperate hard-bottom communities where urchins are ubiquitous. Our results also indicate that exploitation of physical microrefuges, such as grooves and crevices, reduces, but does not prevent, sponge mortality due to bulldozing by urchins. The enhancement of juvenile survival in microrefuges has probably operated as a selective force, favoring larval mechanisms that facilitate selective settlement in refuges.

AB Local population densities of most benthic marine organisms are determined by a variety of processes that act before, during, and after settlement of planktonic propagules to the benthos. Considerable disagreement exists over the relative contribution of each process to patterns of abundance. Using multifactorial experiments, I assessed the effects of resident conspecifics, potential interspecific competitors, predators, and reef location on patterns of recruitment of two temperate reef fishes.
   Recruitment of bluebanded gobies (Lythrypnus dalli) and blackeye gobies (Coryphopterus nicholsii) consistently increased with distance from a nearby large reef. Recruitment of Lythrypnus was enhanced by the presence of older resident conspecifics. I found no strong evidence of any competitive effects between the two species. Predators had a variety of important effects on the density of recruits. Recruitment of Lythrypnus was halved by predators; this was the result of direct and indirect effects of predators: in addition to directly reducing recruit density, predators also reduced recruitment indirectly by reducing the density of older residents to which recruits responded. I developed two related methods for quantifying the contributions of the direct and indirect components of the predator effect. The effect of predation was spatially variable for both species: the net effect of this variability was the elimination of recruitment patterns related to reef location. Hence, the effects of spatially variable input of recruits was dependent upon the presence of predators, and thereby, predation altered the relative importance of the other factors that affected recruitment of the gobies. I argue that a much broader understanding of the ''relative importance'' of multiple causal processes will be gained by striving to understand how the contribution of each process is modified by other processes than by attempting to quantify the ''importance'' of each process.

AB Outbreaks of the gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar (L.), were partially synchronous across the New England states (Massachusetts, Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont) from 1938 to 1992. To explain this synchrony, we investigated the Moran effect, a hypothesis that local population oscillations, which result from similar density-dependent mechanisms operating at time lags, may be synchronized over wide areas by exposure to common weather patterns. We also investigated the thee of climatic release, which postulates that outbreaks are triggered by climatic factors favorable for population growth. Tune series analysis revealed defoliation series in 2 states as Ist-order autoregressive processes and the other 2 as periodic 2nd-order autoregressive processes. Defoliation residuals series computed using the autoregressive models for each state were cross correlated with series of weather variables recorded in the respective states. The weather variables significantly correlated with defoliation residuals in all 4 states were minimum temperature and precipitation in mid-December in the same gypsy moth generation and minimum temperature in mid- to late July of the previous generation. These weather variables also were correlated strongly among the 4 states. The analyses support the predictions of the Moran effect and suggest that common weather may synchronize local populations so as to produce pest outbreaks over wide areas. We did not find convincing evidence to support the theory of climatic release.

AB The effects of elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration on plant-fungi and plant-insect interactions were studied in an emergent marsh in the Chesapeake Bay. Stands of the C-3 sedge Scirpus olneyi Grey. and the C-4 grass Spartina patens (Ait.) Muhl. have been exposed to elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations during each growing season since 1987. In August 1991 the severities of fungal infections and insect infestations were quantified. Shoot nitrogen concentration ([N]) and water content (WC) were determined. In elevated concentrations of atmospheric CO2, 32% fewer S. olneyi plants were infested by insects, and there was a 37% reduction in the severity of a pathogenic fungal infection, compared with plants grown in ambient CO2 concentrations. S. olneyi also had reduced [N], which correlated positively with the severities of fungal infections and insect infestations. Conversely, S. patens had increased WC but unchanged [N] in elevated concentrations of atmospheric CO2 and the severity of fungal infection increased. Elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration increased or decreased the severity of fungal infection depending on at least two interacting factors, [N] and WC; but it did not change the number of plants that were infected with fungi. In contrast, the major results for insects were that the number of plants infected with insects decreased, and that the amount of tissue that each insect ate also decreased.

AB This study provides insight into the importance of top carnivores (top-down control) and nutrient inputs (bottom-up control) in structuring food chains in a terrestrial grassland system. Qualitative predictions about food chain structure are generated using 4 simple models, each differing in assumptions about some key component in the population dynamics of the herbivore trophic level. The four model systems can be classified broadly into two groups (1) those that assume plant resource intake by herbivores is limited by search rate and handling time as described by classic Lotka-Volterra models; and (2) those that assume plant resource intake by herbivores is limited externally by the supply rate of resources as described by alternatives to Lotka-Volterra formulations. The first class of models tends to ascribe greater importance to top-down control of food chain structure whereas the second class places greater weight on bottom-up control. I evaluated the model predictions using experimentally assembled grassland food chains in which I manipulated nutrient inputs and carnivore (wolf spider) abundance to determine the degree of top-down and bottom-up control of grassland plants and herbivores (grasshoppers). The experimental results were most consistent with predictions of the second class of models implying a predominance of bottom-up control of food chain structure.

AB Australian fire weather shows spatiotemporal variability on interannual and multi-decadal time scales. We investigate the climate factors that drive this variability using 39 station-based historical time series of the seasonal 90th-percentile of the McArthur Forest Fire Danger Index (FFDI) extending from 1973 through 2017. Using correlation analyses, we examine the relationship of these time series to the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) and the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), considering both concurrent and time-lagged relationships. Additionally, longer term behaviour of the time series using linear trend analysis is discussed in the context of the climate drivers, Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO) and anthropogenic climate change. The results show that ENSO is the main driver for interannual variability of fire weather, as defined by FFDI in this study, for most of Australia. In general, El Nino-like conditions lead to more extreme fire weather, with this effect stronger in eastern Australia. However, there are significant regional variations to this general rule. In NSW, particularly along the central coast, negative SAM is a primary influence for elevated fire weather in late-winter and spring. In the southeast (VIC and TAS), the El Nino-like impact is exacerbated when positive IOD conditions are simultaneously observed. The spring conditions are key, and strongly influence what is observed during the following summer. On longer time scales (45 years), linear trends are upward at most stations; this trend is strongest in the southeast and during the spring. The positive trends are not driven by the trends in the climate drivers and they are not consistent with hypothesized impacts of the IPO, either before or after its late-1990s shift to the cold phase. We propose that anthropogenic climate change is the primary driver of the trend, through both higher mean temperatures and potentially through associated shifts in large-scale rainfall patterns. Variations from interannual factors are generally larger in magnitude than the trend effects observed to date.

AB Nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) are essential nutrients for plant metabolism, and their availability often limits primary productivity. Whereas the effects of N availability on photosynthetic capacity are well established, we still know relatively little about the effects of P availability at a foliar level, especially in P-limited tropical forests. We examined photosynthetic capacity, leaf mass per area (LMA) and foliar P fractions in five woody plant species after 6 years of N and P fertilization in a lowland tropical forest. Foliar N:P ratios indicated P limitation of the unfertilized plants; accordingly, photosynthetic P-use efficiency (PPUE) and LMA decreased with P addition, and foliar N and P concentrations increased, whereas N addition had little effect on measured foliar traits. However, P addition enhanced photosynthetic capacity only in one species and not in other four species. We then assessed plant acclimation to low P availability by quantifying four fractions of foliar P representing different functional pools: structural P, metabolic P (including inorganic P), nucleic acid P, and residual P. We found that P addition enhanced the concentrations of metabolic, structural, and nucleic acid P fractions in all species, but the magnitude of the effect was species-specific. Our findings indicate that tropical species acclimate to low P availability by altering allocation of foliar P to meet the demand of P for photosynthesis. Importantly, species typical of lowland tropical forests in East Asia maintained their photosynthetic rate under low P availability. We conclude that P limitation of leaf photosynthetic capacity may not be as common as previously assumed due to plant acclimation mechanisms in low-P tropical forests. Species-specific strategies to allocate P to different foliar fractions represent a potentially important adaptive mechanism for plants in P-limited systems.

AB Mechanistic forecasts of how species will respond to climate change are highly desired but difficult to achieve. Because processes at different scales are explicit in such models, careful assessments of their predictive abilities can provide valuable insights that will be relevant to functionally similar species. However, there are surprisingly few comprehensive field tests of mechanistic niche models in the literature. We applied a general, thermodynamically grounded modeling framework to determine the fundamental niche of an extremely well-studied herbivorous ectotherm, the sleepy lizard Tiliqua rugosa. We then compared the model predictions with detailed long-term field observations that included sub-hourly data on microclimate, activity levels, home ranges, and body temperatures as well as annual to decadal patterns of body condition and growth. Body temperature predictions inferred from gridded climatic data were within 10% of empirically observed values and explained >70% of observed daytime activity patterns across all lizards. However, some periods of activity restriction were explained by predicted desiccation level rather than by temperature, and metabolically driven activity requirements were much lower than potential activity time. Decadal trajectories of field growth and body condition could also be explained to within 10% of observed values, with the variance in trajectories being attributable to whether individuals had access to permanent water. Continent-wide applications of the model partly captured the inland distribution limit, but only after accounting for water limitations. Predicted changes in habitat suitability under six climate change scenarios were generally positive within the species' current range, but varied strongly with predicted rainfall. Temperature is regarded as the major factor that will restrict the distribution and abundance of lizards and other terrestrial ectotherms under climate change. Yet our findings show how water can be more important than temperature in constraining the activity, habitat requirements, and distribution limits of terrestrial ectotherms. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of first-principles computation of the climatic limits on terrestrial animals from gridded environmental data, providing a coherent picture for how species will respond to climate change at different scales of space and time.

AB An upsurge in anthropogenic impacts has hastened the decline of the red panda (Ailurus fulgens). The red panda is a global conservation icon, but holistic conservation management has been hampered by research being restricted to certain locations and population clusters. Building a comprehensive potential habitat map for the red panda is imperative to advance the conservation effort and ensure coordinated management across international boundaries. Here, we use occurrence records of both subspecies of red pandas from across their entire range to build a habitat model using the maximum entropy algorithm (MaxEnt 3.3.3k) and the least correlated bioclimatic variables. We found that the subspecies have separate climatic spaces dominated by temperature-associated variables in the eastern geographic distribution limit and precipitation-associated variables in the western distribution limit. Annual precipitation (BIO12) and maximum temperature in the warmest months (BIO5) were major predictors of habitat suitability for A. f. fulgens and A. f. styani, respectively. Our model predicted 134,975 km(2) of red panda habitat based on 10 percentile thresholds in China (62% of total predicted habitat), Nepal (15%), Myanmar (9%), Bhutan (9%), and India (5%). Existing protected areas (PAs) encompass 28% of red panda habitat, meaning the PA network is currently insufficient and alternative conservation mechanisms are needed to protect the habitat. Bhutan's PAs provide good coverage for the red panda habitat. Furthermore, large areas of habitat were predicted in cross-broader areas, and transboundary conservation will be necessary.

AB The disutility of transfers in multimodal public transport goes beyond the additional walking and waiting times. Although the magnitude of this pure transfer penalty has been proven to be an essential element in the structural design of public transport lines, the scarce available research reveals a wide range of values. The aim of this paper is to develop and apply a framework to estimate the value perceived and assigned by commuters to this penalty. This framework includes all the other elements considered by users in the case of a trip involving (potential) transfers, in order to obtain the impact of each one. The framework is based on the discrete choices paradigm and applied to data collected in Madrid, Spain. The results show that the pure transfer penalty is comparable to a 15.2-17.7 equivalent increase in in-vehicle minutes; i.e. longer trips may be preferred to faster alternatives with transfers, even if the additional walking. and waiting times are zero. As well as the pure transfer penalty, the model also captures the effects of habit, crowding, walking, waiting and in-vehicle times, information, and the additional effect of intermodality on transfers.

AB Comparisons of fish trophic data are limited by the range of methods used to quantify dietary composition, with scientists yet to agree on a standard approach to stomach content analysis. This study examined how prey type and condition of stomach contents influenced identification of prey and the ability to estimate dietary importance by methodologies based on volume, weight, number and frequency of occurrence. A total of 154 stomachs were examined from six trophically diverse, temperate fish species. The condition of prey i.e. entirety, digestion state, and presence of mucus were recorded for each stomach, and the taxonomic level to which prey could be identified to assessed. The influence of prey condition on the application of each metric was then assessed. Descriptions based on prey volume or weight were significantly affected by differences in prey condition. In contrast, the simple presence/absence or frequency of occurrence approach (%F) provided a rapid, unambiguous and reliable account of diet composition and was not affected by the condition of prey. It was the only approach able to quantify the full spectrum of prey types in a consistent manner, making it the most practical metric. Variable prey condition also highlighted uncertainties in prey identification. We recommend routine reporting of how prey condition influences identification, the specific approaches used, and any assumptions made in identifying prey. In addition, %F data should be reported as a nested hierarchy of taxonomic levels which allows these data to be readily standardised across studies and used in meta-analyses.

AB 1. In a previous article, we advocated against using the sum of Akaike weights (SW) as a metric to distinguish between genuine and spurious variables in Information Theoretic (IT) statistical analyses. A recent article (Giam & Olden, Methods in Ecology and Evolution, 2016, 7, 388) criticises our finding and instead argues in favour of SW. It points out that (1) we performed a biased data-generation procedure and (2) we erroneously evaluated SW on its capacity to estimate the proportion of variance in the data explained by a variable. We here respond to these points.
   2. Giam and Olden's first concern is unfounded. When using the data-generating code they proposed, SW remains very imprecise. To respond to their second concern, we first list the meanings taken by a variable's importance in the context of IT. Although, SW is presented as an estimate of variable relative importance in methodological textbooks (i.e. a variable's rank in importance or its relative contribution to the variance in the data), it is also used as a metric of variable absolute importance (i.e. a variable's absolute effect size or its statistical significance). We then compare SW to alternative metrics on its ability to estimate variable absolute or relative importance.
   3. SW values have low repeatability across analyses. As a result, based on SW, it is hard to distinguish between variables with weak and large effects. For estimations of variable absolute importance, experimenters should prefer model-averaged parameter estimates and/or compare nested models based on evidence ratios. Sum of Akaike weights is also a poor metric of variable relative importance. We showed that correct variable ranking in importance was generally more frequent when using model-averaged standardised parameter estimates, than when using SW.
   4. To avoid recurrent errors in ecology and evolution, we therefore warn against the use of SW for estimations of variable absolute and relative importance and we propose that experimenters should instead use model-averaged standardised parameter estimates for statistical inferences.

AB 1. Post-dispersal seed predators contribute substantially to seed loss across many ecosystems. Most research has focused on understanding sources of variation in seed loss, without appreciating the implications of seed predation for plant coexistence, community assembly and broader community theory. Meanwhile, research aimed at understanding coexistence and community assembly processes in plant communities has focused on axes of dispersal and resource competition and the traits influencing these processes, without accounting for the role of generalist seed predators.
   2. We review the unique features of post-dispersal seed predation and assess the implications of seed loss on three critical components of plant community organization - coexistence, community structure and plant invasions - pointing to both important gaps in theory and empirical knowledge. We highlight how understanding fundamental controls on plant recruitment is central to determining how seed predation affects plant recruitment and coexistence. We discuss how accounting for seed predator foraging strategies may shift trait-based inferences of community assembly.
   3. Synthesis. We argue that seed predation by generalist consumers, which is pervasive in temperate communities, should be better incorporated into plant community theory. Experiments that specifically incorporate the presence and attributes of the seed predator community and that follow seed fate would fill important knowledge gaps. Particularly needed are studies focused on strengthening the connections between seed removal and plant establishment and linking selective and density-dependent foraging strategies to plant traits. Advancing our understanding of the processes regulating plant coexistence and community assembly requires that future research not only acknowledge but also incorporate generalist consumers' effects on plant communities.

AB High abundance and widespread distribution of the archaeal phylum Bathyarchaeota in marine environment have been recognized recently, but knowledge about Bathyarchaeota in terrestrial settings and their correlation with environmental parameters is fairly limited. Here we reported the abundance of Bathyarchaeota members across different ecosystems and their correlation with environmental factors by constructing 16S rRNA clone libraries of peat from the Dajiuhu Peatland, coupling with bioinformatics analysis of 16S rRNA data available to date in NCBI database. In total, 1456 Bathyarchaeota sequences from 28 sites were subjected to UniFrac analysis based on phylogenetic distance and multivariate regression tree analysis of taxonomy. Both phylogenetic and taxon-based approaches showed that salinity, total organic carbon and temperature significantly influenced the distribution of Bathyarchaeota across different terrestrial habitats. By applying the ecological concept of 'indicator species', we identify 9 indicator groups among the 6 habitats with the most in the estuary sediments. Network analysis showed that members of Bathyarchaeota formed the "backbone" of archaeal community and often co-occurred with Methanomicrobia. These results suggest that Bathyarchaeota may play an important ecological role within archaeal communities via a potential symbiotic association with Methanomicrobia. Our results shed light on understanding of the biogeography, potential functions of Bathyarchaeota and environment conditions that influence Bathyarchaea distribution in terrestrial settings.

AB Most fluvial networks worldwide include watercourses that recurrently cease to flow and run dry. The spatial and temporal extent of the dry phase of these temporary watercourses is increasing as a result of global change. Yet, current estimates of carbon emissions from fluvial networks do not consider temporary watercourses when they are dry. We characterized the magnitude and variability of carbon emissions from dry watercourses by measuring the carbon dioxide (CO2) flux from 10 dry streambeds of a fluvial network during the dry period and comparing it to the CO2 flux from the same streambeds during the flowing period and to the CO2 flux from their adjacent upland soils. We also looked for potential drivers regulating the CO2 emissions by examining the main physical and chemical properties of dry streambed sediments and adjacent upland soils. The CO2 efflux from dry streambeds (mean +/- A SD = 781.4 +/- A 390.2 mmol m(-2) day(-1)) doubled the CO2 efflux from flowing streambeds (305.6 +/- A 206.1 mmol m(-2) day(-1)) and was comparable to the CO2 efflux from upland soils (896.1 +/- A 263.2 mmol m(-2) day(-1)). However, dry streambed sediments and upland soils were physicochemically distinct and differed in the variables regulating their CO2 efflux. Overall, our results indicate that dry streambeds constitute a unique and biogeochemically active habitat that can emit significant amounts of CO2 to the atmosphere. Thus, omitting CO2 emissions from temporary streams when they are dry may overlook the role of a key component of the carbon balance of fluvial networks.

AB Lowland boreal forest ecosystems in Alaska are dominated by wetlands comprised of a complex mosaic of fens, collapse-scar bogs, low shrub/scrub, and forests growing on elevated ice-rich permafrost soils. Thermokarst has affected the lowlands of the Tanana Flats in central Alaska for centuries, as thawing permafrost collapses forests that transition to wetlands. Located within the discontinuous permafrost zone, this region has significantly warmed over the past half-century, and much of these carbon-rich permafrost soils are now within similar to 0.5 degrees C of thawing. Increased permafrost thaw in lowland boreal forests in response to warming may have consequences for the climate system. This study evaluates the trajectories and potential drivers of 60years of forest change in a landscape subjected to permafrost thaw in unburned dominant forest types (paper birch and black spruce) associated with location on elevated permafrost plateau and across multiple time periods (1949, 1978, 1986, 1998, and 2009) using historical and contemporary aerial and satellite images for change detection. We developed (i) a deterministic statistical model to evaluate the potential climatic controls on forest change using gradient boosting and regression tree analysis, and (ii) a 30x30m land cover map of the Tanana Flats to estimate the potential landscape-level losses of forest area due to thermokarst from 1949 to 2009. Over the 60-year period, we observed a nonlinear loss of birch forests and a relatively continuous gain of spruce forest associated with thermokarst and forest succession, while gradient boosting/regression tree models identify precipitation and forest fragmentation as the primary factors controlling birch and spruce forest change, respectively. Between 1950 and 2009, landscape-level analysis estimates a transition of similar to 15km(2) or similar to 7% of birch forests to wetlands, where the greatest change followed warm periods. This work highlights that the vulnerability and resilience of lowland ice-rich permafrost ecosystems to climate changes depend on forest type.

AB In human dominated landscapes many diverse, and often antagonistic, human activities are intentionally and inadvertently determining the supply of various ecosystem services. Understanding how different social and ecological factors shape the availability of ecosystem services is essential for fair and effective policy and management. In this paper, we evaluate how well alternative social-ecological models of human impact on ecosystems explain patterns of 16 ecosystem services (ES) across the 62 municipalities of the Norrstrom drainage basin in Sweden. We test four models of human impact on ecosystems, land use, ecological modernization, ecological footprint, and location theory, and test their ability to predict both individual ES and bundles of ES. We find that different models do best to predict different types of individual ES. Land use is the best model for predicting provisioning services, standing water quality, biodiversity appreciation, and cross-country skiing, while other models work better for the remaining services. However, this range of models is not able to predict some of the cultural ES. ES bundles are predicted worse than individual ES by these models, but provide a clear picture of variation in multiple ecosystem services based on limited information. Based on our results, we offer suggestions on how social-ecological modeling and assessments of ecosystems can be further developed.

AB Biological invasions are a major concern in conservation, especially because global transport of species is still increasing rapidly. Conservationists hope to anticipate and thus prevent future invasions by identifying and regulating potentially invasive species through species risk assessments and international trade regulations. Among many introduction pathways of non-native species, horticulture is a particularly important driver of plant invasions. In recent decades, the horticultural industry expanded globally and changed structurally through the emergence of new distribution channels, including internet trade (e-commerce). Using an automated search algorithm, we surveyed, on a daily basis, e-commerce trade on 10 major online auction sites (including eBay) of approximately three-fifths of the world's spermatophyte flora. Many recognized invasive plant species (>500 species) (i.e., species associated with ecological or socio-economic problems) were traded daily worldwide on the internet. A markedly higher proportion of invasive than non-invasive species were available online. Typically, for a particular plant family, 30-80% of recognized invasive species were detected on an auction site, but only a few percentages of all species in the plant family were detected on a site. Families that were more traded had a higher proportion of invasive species than families that were less traded. For woody species, there was a significant positive relationship between the number of regions where a species was sold and the number of regions where it was invasive. Our results indicate that biosecurity is not effectively regulating online plant trade. In the future, automated monitoring of e-commerce may help prevent the spread of invasive species, provide information on emerging trade connectivity across national borders, and be used in horizon scanning exercises for early detection of new species and their geographic source areas in international trade.

AB The distribution of species is shifting in response to recent climate change. Changes in the abundance and distributions of habitat-forming species can have knock-on effects on community structure, biodiversity patterns and ecological processes. We empirically examined temporal changes in the abundance of the warm-water kelp Laminaria ochroleuca at its poleward range edge in the Western English Channel. Resurveys of historical sites indicated that the abundance of L. ochroleuca has increased significantly in recent decades. Moreover, examination of historical records suggested that L. ochroleuca has extended its distribution from sheltered coasts on to moderately wave-exposed open coasts, where it now co-exists and competes with the assemblage dominant Laminaria hyperborea. Proliferation of L. ochroleuca at its poleward range edge corresponds with a period of rapid warming in the Western English Channel. Preliminary comparisons between L. ochroleuca and L. hyperborea highlighted some subtle but ecologically significant differences in structure and function. In summer, the average biomass of epiphytic stipe assemblages on L. hyperborea was 86 times greater than on L. ochroleuca whereas, on average, L. ochroleuca had a greater stipe length and its blade supported 18 times as many gastropod grazers (Gibbula cineraria). Differences in summer growth rates were also recorded, with L. ochroleuca being more productive than L. hyperborea throughout July. Comprehensive seasonally replicated comparisons are needed to examine the wider implications of proliferation of L. ochroleuca at its poleward range edge, but our study suggests that local biodiversity patterns and ecological processes (e.g. timing of productivity and trophic pathways) on shallow subtidal reefs may be altered by shifts in the relative abundances of habitat-forming kelp species.

AB The eastern North American monarch population is declining, as evidenced by the area occupied by overwintering adults. Recently, decreasing availability of breeding habitat has been most strongly implicated in this decline. An alternative, nonexclusive explanation for the recent population decline is decreasing survival. We used 18 yr of data from the Monarch Larva Monitoring Project, a citizen science program, to determine immature monarch mortality rates over time as well as factors associated with increased mortality. Our data included field measures of mortality from egg to the final larval instar, and mortality due to parasitoids and other causes, assessed by rearing field-collected monarchs. Average egg to fifth-instar survival ranged from similar to 7 to 10% across all regions. Survival from fifth instar to adult ranged from similar to 60 to 90%, although this overestimates survival because monarchs are not exposed to many mortality factors when reared indoors. Both survival rates showed a great deal of temporal and spatial variation. Survival tended to be higher in sites that were planted and had more milkweed plants. There was a negative effect of per plant egg density on survival, suggesting density dependence. Survival rates appear to be declining from 1997 to 2014, and we discuss possible reasons for this pattern. Finally, we estimate that across all years in the north-central United States, where we have the most data, a minimum number of similar to 29 milkweed plants are required to produce an adult monarch that will be part of the fall migratory generation.

AB Leaf area index (LAI) and leaf chlorophyll content (Chl(l)) represent key biophysical and biochemical controls on water, energy and carbon exchange processes in the terrestrial biosphere. In combination, [LAI and Chi(1), provide critical information on vegetation density, vitality and photosynthetic potentials. However, simultaneous retrieval of LAI and Chl(l) from space observations is extremely challenging. Regularization strategies are required to increase the robustness and accuracy of retrieved properties and enable more reliable separation of soil, leaf and canopy parameters. To address these challenges, the REGularized canopy reFLECtance model (REGFLEC) inversion system was refined to incorporate enhanced techniques for exploiting ancillary LAI and temporal information derived from multiple satellite scenes. In this current analysis, REGFLEC is applied to a time-series of Landsat data.
   A novel aspect of the REGFLEC approach is the fact that no site-specific data are required to calibrate the model, which may be run in a largely automated fashion using information extracted entirely from image-based and other widely available datasets. Validation results, based upon in-situ LAI and Chl(l) observations collected over maize and soybean fields in central Nebraska for the period 2001-2005, demonstrate Chl(l) retrieval with a relative root-mean-square-deviation (RMSD) on the order of 19% (RMSD = 8.42 pg cm(-2)). While Chli retrievals were clearly influenced by the version of the leaf optical properties model used (PROSPECT), the application of spatio-temporal regularization constraints was shown to be critical for estimating Chl(l) with sufficient accuracy. REGFLEC also reproduced the dynamics of in-situ measured LAI well (r(2) = 0.85), but estimates were biased low, particularly over maize (LAI was underestimated by -36 %). This disparity may be attributed to differences between effective and true LAI caused by significant foliage clumping not being properly accounted for in the canopy reflectance model (SAIL). Additional advances in the retrieval of canopy biophysical and leaf biochemical constituents will require innovative use of existing remote sensing data within physically realistic canopy reflectance models along with the ability to exploit the enhanced spectral and spatial capabilities of upcoming satellite systems.

AB Humans first arrived on Madagascar only a few thousand years ago. Subsequent habitat destruction and hunting activities have had significant impacts on the island's biodiversity, including the extinction of megafauna. For example, we know of 17 recently extinct 'subfossil' lemur species, all of which were substantially larger (body mass similar to 11-160 kg) than any living population of the similar to 100 extant lemur species (largest body mass similar to 6.8 kg). We used ancient DNA and genomic methods to study subfossil lemur extinction biology and update our understanding of extant lemur conservation risk factors by i) reconstructing a comprehensive phylogeny of extinct and extant lemurs, and ii) testing whether low genetic diversity is associated with body size and extinction risk. We recovered complete or near-complete mitochondrial genomes from five subfossil lemur taxa, and generated sequence data from population samples of two extinct and eight extant lemur species. Phylogenetic comparisons resolved prior taxonomic uncertainties and confirmed that the extinct subfossil species did not comprise a single clade. Genetic diversity estimates for the two sampled extinct species were relatively low, suggesting small historical population sizes. Low genetic diversity and small population sizes are both risk factors that would have rendered giant lemurs especially susceptible to extinction. Surprisingly, among the extant lemurs, we did not observe a relationship between body size and genetic diversity. The decoupling of these variables suggests that risk factors other than body size may have as much or more meaning for establishing future lemur conservation priorities. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Biological invasions are largely thought to be contemporary, having recently increased sharply in the wake of globalization. However, human commerce had already become global by the mid-16th century when the Spanish connected the New World with Europe and Asia via their Manila galleon and West Indies trade routes. We use genetic data to trace the global invasion of one of the world's most widespread and invasive pest ants, the tropical fire ant, Solenopsis geminata. Our results reveal a pattern of introduction of Old World populations that is highly consistent with historical trading routes suggesting that Spanish trade introduced the tropical fire ant to Asia in the 16th century. We identify southwestern Mexico as the most likely source for the invasive populations, which is consistent with the use of Acapulco as the major Spanish port on the Pacific Ocean. From there, the Spanish galleons brought silver to Manila, which served as a hub for trade with China. The genetic data document a corresponding spread of S.geminata from Mexico via Manila to Taiwan and from there, throughout the Old World. Our descriptions of the worldwide spread of S.geminata represent a rare documented case of a biological invasion of a highly invasive and globally distributed pest species due to the earliest stages of global commerce.

AB A remarkable radiation of completely eyeless, cave-obligate spider species (Cicurina) has been described from limestone caves of Texas. This radiation includes over 50 described species, with a large number of hypothesized single-cave endemics, and four species listed as US Federally Endangered. Because of this conservation importance, species delimitation in the group is high-stakes'- it is imperative that species hypotheses are data rich, objective, and robust. This study focuses on a complex of four cave-dwelling Cicurina distributed on the northwestern edge of Austin, Texas. Several of the existing species hypotheses in this complex are weak, based on morphological comparisons of small samples of adult female specimens; one species description (for C.wartoni) is based on a single adult specimen. Species limits in this group were newly assessed using morphological, mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequence data evidence, analysed using a variety of approaches. All data support a clear lineage separation between C.buwata versus the C.travisae complex (including C.travisae, C.wartoni and C.reddelli). Observed congruence across multiple analyses indicate that the C.travisae complex represents a single species, and the formal species synonymy presented here has important conservation implications. The integrative framework utilized in this study serves as a potential model for other Texas cave Cicurina, including US Federally Endangered species. More generally, this study illustrates how and why taxon-focused conservation efforts must prioritize modern species delimitation research (if the existing taxonomy is weak), before devoting precious downstream resources to conservation efforts. The study also highlights the issue of taxonomic type II error that diversity biologists increasingly face as species delimitation moves into the genomics era.

AB Athrotaxis cupressoides is a slow-growing and long-lived conifer that occurs in the subalpine temperate forests of Tasmania, a continental island to the south of Australia. In 1960-1961, human-ignited wildfires occurred during an extremely dry summer that killed many A. cupressoides stands on the high plateau in the center of Tasmania. That fire year, coupled with subsequent regeneration failure, caused a loss of ca. 10% of the geographic extent of this endemic Tasmanian forest type. To provide historical context for these large-scale fire events, we (i) collected dendroecological, floristic, and structural data, (ii) documented the postfire survival and regeneration of A. cupressoides and co-occurring understory species, and (iii) assessed postfire understory plant community composition and flammability. We found that fire frequency did not vary following the arrival of European settlers, and that A. cupressoides populations were able to persist under a regime of low-to-mid severity fires prior to the 1960 fires. Our data indicate that the 1960 fires were (i) of greater severity than previous fires, (ii) herbivory by native marsupials may limit seedling survival in both burned and unburned A. cupressoides stands, and (iii) the loss of A. cupressoides populations is largely irreversible given the relatively high fuel loads of postfire vegetation communities that are dominated by resprouting shrubs. We suggest that the feedback between regeneration failure and increased flammability will be further exacerbated by a warmer and drier climate causing A. cupressoides to contract to the most fire-proof landscape settings.

AB Intraspecific trait variation is hypothesized to influence the relative importance of community assembly mechanisms. However, few studies have explicitly considered how intraspecific trait variation among ontogenetic stages influences community assembly across environmental gradients. Because the relative importance of abiotic and biotic assembly mechanisms can differ among ontogenetic stages within and across environments, ontogenetic trait variation may have an important influence on patterns of functional diversity and inferred assembly mechanisms. We tested the hypothesis that variation in functional diversity across a topo-edaphic gradient differs among ontogenetic stages and that these patterns reflect a shift in the relative importance of different assembly mechanisms. In a temperate forest in the Missouri Ozarks, USA, we compared functional diversity of leaf size and specific leaf area (SLA) of 34 woody plant species at two ontogenetic stages (adults and saplings) to test predictions about how the relative importance of abiotic and biotic filtering changes among adult and sapling communities. Local communities of adults had lower mean SLA and lower functional dispersion of SLA than expected by chance, particularly at the resource-limited end of the topo-edaphic gradient, suggesting an important role for abiotic filtering among co-occurring adults. In contrast, local communities of saplings often had higher functional dispersion of leaf size and SLA than expected by chance regardless of their location along the topo-edaphic gradient, suggesting an important role for biotic filtering among co-occurring saplings. Moreover, the overall strength of trait-environment relationships varied between saplings and adults for both leaf traits, generally resulting in stronger environmental shifts in mean trait values and trait dispersion for adults relative to saplings. Our results illustrate how community assembly mechanisms may shift in their relative importance during ontogeny, leading to variable patterns of functional diversity across environmental gradients. Moreover, our results highlight the importance of integrating ontogeny, an important axis of intraspecific trait variability, into approaches that use plant functional traits to understand community assembly and species coexistence.

AB Current spatially explicit approaches to map and assess ecosystem services are often grounded on unreliable proxy data based on land use/cover to derive ecosystem service indicators. These approaches fail to make a distinction between the actual service provision and the underlying ecosystem capacity to provide the service. We present an integrative conceptual framework to estimate the provision of soil erosion prevention by combining the structural impact of soil erosion and the social-ecological processes that allow for its mitigation. The framework was tested and illustrated in the Portel municipality in Southern Portugal, a Mediterranean silvo-pastoral system that is prone to desertification and soil degradation. The results show a clear difference in the spatial and temporal distribution of the capacity for ecosystem service provision and the actual ecosystem service provision. It also shows that although the average actual ecosystem service provision in the region is sufficient to mitigate the existing structural impact, vulnerable areas can be identified where significant soil losses are not mitigated at present. This becomes more significant when comparing different land management intensities. Considering these results, we argue that the general assumption that there is an almost direct relation between the capacity for ecosystem service provision of a given area and the actual ecosystem service provision is wrong. We also discuss how the framework presented here could be used to support land management and policy, and how it can be adapted for other regulating services.

AB Aim Species distributions have been continuously adjusting to changing climatic conditions throughout the glacial-interglacial cycles. In the marine realm, evidence suggests that latitudinal range shifts, involving both spatial expansions and trailing-edge contractions, may represent a common response to climatic oscillations. The biogeographical histories of coastal organisms, however, have been inferred primarily using molecular markers, potentially overlooking past range dynamics beyond contemporary rear edges. In this study we combined species distribution models (SDMs) and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) data to investigate the biogeographical history of the high-intertidal seaweed Pelvetia canaliculata. We investigated the hypotheses that its distribution is set by both marine and terrestrial climates and that its range has shifted northwards since the Last Glacial Maximum. Location North-eastern Atlantic intertidal from Portugal to Norway. Methods In total, 432 individuals at 27 sites covering the extant range of Pelvetia canaliculata were sampled and sequenced for a c. 500bp mtDNA intergenic spacer. A niche model was developed using marine and terrestrial variables. Range dynamics were reconstructed based on the geographical patterns of genetic variation and on the SDM projections for the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and the present. Results The best distribution models incorporated both marine and terrestrial variables. LGM projections revealed suitable habitat between southern Morocco and the periglacial shorelines of the Celtic Sea. Pelvetia canaliculata exhibited a highly structured phylogeography, being subdivided into three largely disjunct lineages, two of them endemic to Iberia. The central/northern European lineage exhibited the highest haplotypic diversity and showed a consistent decline in nucleotide diversity and haplotypic richness at higher latitudes. Main conclusions Assuming species/climate equilibrium, SDMs supported the hypothesis of a post-glacial latitudinal range shift. Molecular variation revealed contrasting demographic behaviours in Iberian and periglacial regions. In Iberia the low haplotypic diversity suggested complex range dynamics that are not fully captured by SDM projections. Periglacial regions, identified as the source of poleward colonization, were inferred to have been comparatively more stable. Greater attention should be paid to marine range dynamics at low-latitude range margins, particularly in genetically structured low-dispersal species exhibiting southern endemic variation.

AB Behavioural responses can help species persist in habitats modified by humans. Roads and traffic greatly affect animals' mortality not only through habitat structure modifications but also through direct mortality owing to collisions. Although species are known to differ in their sensitivity to the risk of collision, whether individuals can change their behaviour in response to this is still unknown. Here, we tested whether common European birds changed their flight initiation distances (FIDs) in response to vehicles according to road speed limit (a known factor affecting killing rates on roads) and vehicle speed. We found that FID increased with speed limit, although vehicle speed had no effect. This suggests that birds adjust their flight distance to speed limit, which may reduce collision risks and decrease mortality maximizing the time allocated to foraging behaviours. Mobility and territory size are likely to affect an individuals' ability to respond adaptively to local speed limits.

AB Understanding life history traits is an important first step in formulating effective conservation and management strategies. The use of artificial propagation and supplementation as such a strategy can have numerous effects on the supplemented natural populations and minimizing life history divergence is crucial in minimizing these effects. Here, we use single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotypes for large-scale parentage analysis and pedigree reconstruction in a hatchery population of steelhead, the anadromous form of rainbow trout. Nearly complete sampling of the broodstock for several consecutive years in two hatchery programmes allowed inference about multiple aspects of life history. Reconstruction of cohort age distribution revealed a strong component of fish that spawn at 2years of age, in contrast to programme goals and distinct from naturally spawning steelhead in the region, which raises a significant conservation concern. The first estimates of variance in family size for steelhead in this region can be used to calculate effective population size and probabilities of inbreeding, and estimation of iteroparity rate indicates that it is reduced by hatchery production. Finally, correlations between family members in the day of spawning revealed for the first time a strongly heritable component to this important life history trait in steelhead and demonstrated the potential for selection to alter life history traits rapidly in response to changes in environmental conditions. Taken together, these results demonstrate the extraordinary promise of SNP-based pedigree reconstruction for providing biological inference in high-fecundity organisms that is not easily achievable with traditional physical tags.

AB Adoption of the ecosystem approach to fisheries management relies on recognition of the link between fish and other components of the ecosystem, namely their physical and biological habitat. However, identifying the habitat requirements of marine fishes and hence determining their distribution in space and time is scientifically complex. We analysed the methodologies and findings of research on temperate, demersal fish habitat requirements to highlight the main developments in this field and to identify potential shortfalls. Many studies were undertaken over large spatial scales (100skm(2)) and these generally correlated abundances of fish to abiotic variables. Biological variables were accounted for less often. Small spatial scale (m(2)), experimental studies were comparatively sparse and commonly focused on biotic variables. Whilst the number of studies focusing on abiotic variables increased with increasing spatial scale, the proportion of studies finding significant relationships between habitat and fish distribution remained constant. This mismatch indicates there is no justification for the tendency to analyse abiotic habitat variables at large spatial scales. Innovative modelling techniques and habitat mapping technologies are developing rapidly, providing new insights at the larger spatial scales. However, there is a clear need for a reduction in study scale, or increase in resolution additional to the integration of biotic variables. We argue that development of sound predictive science in the field of demersal fish habitat determination is reliant on a change in focus along these lines. This is especially important if spatial management strategies, such as Marine Protected Areas (MPA) or No Take Zones (NTZ), are to be used in future ecosystem-based approaches to fisheries management.

AB Aim Understanding the stability of realized niches is crucial for predicting the responses of species to climate change. One approach is to evaluate the niche differences of populations of the same species that occupy regions that are geographically disconnected. Here, we assess niche conservatism along thermal gradients for 26 plant species with a disjunct distribution between the Alps and the Arctic.
   Location European Alps and Norwegian Finnmark.
   Methods We collected a comprehensive dataset of 26 arctic-alpine plant occurrences in two regions. We assessed niche conservatism through a multispecies comparison and analysed species rankings at cold and warm thermal limits along two distinct gradients corresponding to (1) air temperatures at 2 m above ground level and (2) elevation distances to the tree line (TLD) for the two regions. We assessed whether observed relationships were close to those predicted under thermal limit conservatism.
   Results We found a weak similarity in species ranking at the warm thermal limits. The range of warm thermal limits for the 26 species was much larger in the Alps than in Finnmark. We found a stronger similarity in species ranking and correspondence at the cold thermal limit along the gradients of 2-m temperature and TLD. Yet along the 2-m temperature gradient the cold thermal limits of species in the Alps were lower on average than those in Finnmark.
   Main conclusion We found low conservatism of the warm thermal limits but a stronger conservatism of the cold thermal limits. We suggest that biotic interactions at the warm thermal limit are likely to modulate species responses more strongly than at the cold limit. The differing biotic context between the two regions is probably responsible for the observed differences in realized niches.

AB Aim Many mangrove communities form bands parallel to the shoreline with each community dominated by a single species. However, the key determinants of mangrove species distribution across the intertidal zone are not well understood. We aimed to quantify the relationship between species' dominance and the hydroperiod (defined as the duration of inundation in a year), soil salinity and the salinity of inundating water for three dominant species, Sonneratia alba, Rhizophora stylosa and Ceriops tagal. Location An extensive (20,000 ha), largely intact mangrove forest in northern Australia, of some note as mangrove forests are threatened globally. Methods We related species dominance to the explanatory variables by applying two statistical modelling approaches: generalized linear models (GLMs), where a set of competing models were evaluated; and boosted regression tree models (BRTs), an approach that automatically captures interactions and nonlinear relationships between variables. Results Both GLM and BRT models achieved strong predictive performance for all species based on cross-validation, with receiver operating characteristics above 0.85 for all species, and 88% of deviance explained for S.alba, 42% for R.stylosa and 35% for C.tagal. All models indicated that the hydroperiod was the key variable influencing distribution, followed by soil salinity. The salinity of inundating water was the least informative variable in the models. Ecological space, determined by gradients in hydroperiod and soil salinity, was partitioned between the three species with little overlap. Main conclusions As anticipated changes in sea level will alter the hydroperiod, our findings are critical for global forecasting of future distributions of mangrove communities, and for the design of mitigation and adaptation measures.

AB The importance of spatial pattern in ecosystems has long been recognized. However, incorporating patchiness into our understanding of forces regulating ecosystems has proved challenging. We used a combination of continuously sampling moored sensors, complemented by shipboard sampling, to measure the temporal variation, abundance and vertical distribution of four trophic levels in Hawaii's near shore pelagic ecosystem. Using an analysis approach from trophic dynamics, we found that the frequency and intensity of spatial aggregations-rather than total biomass-in each step of a food chain involving phytoplankton, copepods, mesopelagic micronekton and spinner dolphins (Stenella longirostris) were the most significant predictors of variation in adjacent trophic levels. Patches of organisms had impacts disproportionate to the biomass of organisms within them. Our results are in accordance with resource limitation-mediated by patch dynamics-regulating structure at each trophic step in this ecosystem, as well as the foraging behaviour of the top predator. Because of their high degree of heterogeneity, ecosystem-level effects of patchiness such as this may be common in many pelagic marine systems.

AB In the past decade, Houston, Texas has been virtually overrun by an unidentified ant species, the sudden appearance and enormous population sizes and densities of which have received national media attention. The Rasberry Crazy Ant, as it has become known due to its uncertain species status, has since spread to neighboring states and is still a major concern to pest control officials. Previous attempts at identifying this species have resulted in widely different conclusions in regards to its native range, source, and biology. We identify this highly invasive pest species as Nylanderia fulva (Mayr) using morphometric data measured from 14 characters, molecular sequence data consisting of 4,669 aligned nucleotide sites from six independent loci and comparison with type specimens. This identification will allow for the study and control of this emerging pest species to proceed unencumbered by taxonomic uncertainty. We also show that N. fulva has a much wider distribution than previously thought and has most likely invaded all of the Gulf Coast states.

AB Competition is often most intense between similar sized organisms that have similar ecological requirements. Many coral reef fish species settle preferentially to live coral at the end of their larval phase where they interact with other species that recruited to the same habitat patch at a similar time. Mortality is high and usually selective and individuals must compete for low risk space. This study examined the competitive interactions between two species of juvenile damselfish and the extent to which interactions that occurred within a recruitment cohort established the disjunct distribution patterns that were displayed in later life stages. Censuses and field experiments with juveniles found that one species, the ambon damsel, was dominant immediately after settlement and pushed the subordinate species higher up the reef and further from shelter. Presence of a competitor resulted in reduced growth for both species. Juvenile size was the best predictor of competitive success and outweighed the effects of short term prior residency. Size at settlement also dramatically influenced survival, with slightly larger individuals displaying higher aggression, pushing the subordinate species into higher risk habitats. While subordinates had higher feeding rates, they also sustained higher mortality. The study highlights the importance of interaction dynamics between species within a recruitment cohort to patterns of growth and distribution of species within communities.

AB Understanding the fundamental niche of invasive species facilitates our ability to predict both dispersal patterns and invasion success and therefore provides the basis for better-informed conservation and management policies. Here we focus on Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus Linnaeus, 1758), one of the most widely cultured fish worldwide and a species that has escaped local aquaculture facilities to become established in a coastal-draining river in Mississippi (northern Gulf of Mexico). Using empirical physiological data, logistic regression models were developed to predict the probabilities of Nile tilapia survival, growth, and reproduction at different combinations of temperature (14 and 30 degrees C) and salinity (0-60, by increments of 10). These predictive models were combined with kriged seasonal salinity data derived from multiple long-term data sets to project the species' fundamental niche in Mississippi coastal waters during normal salinity years (averaged across all years) and salinity patterns in extremely wet and dry years (which might emerge more frequently under scenarios of climate change). The derived fundamental niche projections showed that during the summer, Nile tilapia is capable of surviving throughout Mississippi's coastal waters but growth and reproduction were limited to river mouths (or upriver). Overwinter survival was also limited to river mouths. The areas where Nile tilapia could survive, grow, and reproduce increased during extremely wet years (2-368%) and decreased during extremely dry years (86-92%) in the summer with a similar pattern holding for overwinter survival. These results indicate that Nile tilapia is capable of 1) using saline waters to gain access to other watersheds throughout the region and 2) establishing populations in nearshore, low-salinity waters, particularly in the western portion of coastal Mississippi.

AB Neotropical forests are being increasingly replaced by a mosaic of patches of different successional stages, agricultural fields and pasture lands. Consequently, the identification of factors shaping the performance of taxa in anthropogenic landscapes is gaining importance, especially for taxa playing critical roles in ecosystem functioning. As phyllostomid bats provide important ecological services through seed dispersal, pollination and control of animal populations, in this study we assessed the relationships between phyllostomid occurrence and the variation in local and landscape level habitat attributes caused by disturbance. We mist-netted phyllostomids in 12 sites representing 4 successional stages of a tropical dry forest (initial, early, intermediate and late). We also quantitatively characterized the habitat attributes at the local (vegetation structure complexity) and the landscape level (forest cover, area and diversity of patches). Two focal scales were considered for landscape characterization: 500 and 1000 m. During 142 sampling nights, we captured 606 individuals representing 15 species and 4 broad guilds. Variation in phyllostomid assemblages, ensembles and populations was associated with variation in local and landscape habitat attributes, and this association was scale-dependent. Specifically, we found a marked guild-specific response, where the abundance of nectarivores tended to be negatively associated with the mean area of dry forest patches, while the abundance of frugivores was positively associated with the percentage of riparian forest. These results are explained by the prevalence of chiropterophilic species in the dry forest and of chiropterochorous species in the riparian forest. Our results indicate that different vegetation classes, as well as a multi-spatial scale approach must be considered for evaluating bat response to variation in landscape attributes. Moreover, for the long-term conservation of phyllostomids in anthropogenic landscapes, we must realize that the management of the habitat at the landscape level is as important as the conservation of particular forest fragments.

AB 1. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) have been proposed as a mechanism to reduce nutrient inputs in agriculture, thereby reducing costs and increasing environmental sustainability. However, before this can be achieved, we need to gain a better understanding of the importance of the prolonged selective pressures acting on indigenous AMF communities.
   2. Much research concentrates on short-term ecological soil u plant u AMF interactions. However, we have little understanding of how long-term manipulations of abiotic conditions can be strong selection agents for AMF communities. Here, we ask how the long-term management of soil fertility and fertilizer use can influence the AM symbiosis. More specifically, we investigated whether 70 years of consistently imposed nutrient limitations affected the structure and symbiotic functioning of indigenous AMF communities.
   3. Using the long-term Static Nutrient Deficiency Experiment carried out since 1937 in Thyrow, Germany, with and without nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) additions, we addressed the following questions: (i) Do different soil fertilizer treatments affect the overall abundance and diversity of indigenous AMF in an agricultural field; and (ii) Does the depletion of a nutrient select for an enhanced AMF ability to supply the deficient nutrient?
   4. We assessed AMF spore diversity in the field and established a common garden experiment where soil nutrient treatments were calibrated against those in the long-term field experiment. For each soil nutrient treatment, we compared the growth responses of barley plants to the indigenous AMF communities isolated from the different soil fertilization treatments in the field.
   5. We found that the long-term use of specific soil fertilization treatments altered the effects of the AMF symbiosis on plant and fungal growth. Consistent with the optimal foraging theory, AMF from N-or P-deficient soils grew larger but reduced plant growth more in those conditions relative to AMF isolated from non-deficient soils. This could result from both community-level changes and / or adaptations within species.
   6. Thus, we propose that the ongoing agronomic management of abiotic selective pressures such as soil fertility needs to be considered as a strong determinant of AMF symbiotic functioning.

AB Climatic oscillations during the last few million years had well-documented effects on the distributions and genomes of temperate plants and animals, but much less is known of their impacts on tropical and subtropical species. In contrast to Europe and North America, ice-sheets did not cover most of China during glacial periods, and the effects of glacial cycles were less dramatic. Fig trees are a predominantly tropical group pollinated by host-specific fig wasps. We employed partial mitochondrial COI (918 bp) and nuclear ITS2 (462 bp) gene sequences to investigate the genetic structure and demographic histories of the wasps that pollinate the subtropical Ficus pumila var. pumila in Southeastern China. Deep genetic divergence in both mitochondrial (7.211.6%) and nuclear genes (1.62.9%) indicates that three pollinator species are present and that they diverged about 4.72 and 6.00 Myr bp. This predates the Quaternary ice ages, but corresponds with the formation of the Taiwan Strait and uplifting of the WuyiXianxia Mountains. The three pollinators have largely allopatric distribution patterns in China and display different postglacial demographic histories. Wiebesia spp. 1 and 2 occupy, respectively, the northern and southern regions of the mainland host range. Their populations both underwent significant postglacial spatial expansions, but at different times and at different rates. Wiebesia sp. 3 is largely restricted to northern islands and shows less evidence of recent population expansion. Their mainly allopatric distributions and different demographic histories are consistent with host plant postglacial expansion from three distinct refugia and suggest one mechanism whereby fig trees gain multiple pollinators.

AB Forecasting of species and ecosystem responses to novel conditions, including climate change, is one of the major challenges facing ecologists at the start of the 21st century. Climate change studies based on species distribution models (SDMs) have been criticized because they extend correlational relationships beyond the observed data. Here, we compared conventional climate-based SDMs against ecohydrological SDMs that include information from process-based simulations of water balance. We examined the current and future distribution of Artemisia tridentata (big sagebrush) representing sagebrush ecosystems, which are widespread in semiarid western North America. For each approach, we calculated ensemble models from nine SDM methods and tested accuracy of each SDM with a null distribution. Climatic conditions included current conditions for 19701999 and two IPCC projections B1 and A2 for 20702099. Ecohydrological conditions were assessed by simulating soil water balance with SOILWAT, a daily time-step, multiple layer, mechanistic, soil water model. Under current conditions, both climatic and ecohydrological SDM approaches produced comparable sagebrush distributions. Overall, sagebrush distribution is forecasted to decrease, with larger decreases under the A2 than under the B1 scenario and strong decreases in the southern part of the range. Increases were forecasted in the northern parts and at higher elevations. Both SDM approaches produced accurate predictions. However, the ecohydrological SDM approach was slightly less accurate than climatic SDMs (-1% in AUC, -4% in Kappa and TSS) and predicted a higher number of habitat patches than observed in the input data. Future predictions of ecohydrological SDMs included an increased number of habitat patches whereas climatic SDMs predicted a decrease. This difference is important for understanding landscape-scale patterns of sagebrush ecosystems and management of sagebrush obligate species for future conditions. Several mechanisms can explain the diverging forecasts; however, we need better insights into the consequences of different datasets for SDMs and how these affect our understanding of future trajectories.

AB The objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of stacked species distribution models in predicting the alpha and gamma species diversity patterns of two important plant clades along elevation in the Andes. We modelled the distribution of the species in the Anthurium genus (53 species) and the Bromeliaceae family (89 species) using six modelling techniques. We combined all of the predictions for the same species in ensemble models based on two different criteria: the average of the rescaled predictions by all techniques and the average of the best techniques. The rescaled predictions were then reclassified into binary predictions (presence/absence). By stacking either the original predictions or binary predictions for both ensemble procedures, we obtained four different species richness models per taxa. The gamma and alpha diversity per elevation band (500 m) was also computed. To evaluate the prediction abilities for the four predictions of species richness and gamma diversity, the models were compared with the real data along an elevation gradient that was independently compiled by specialists. Finally, we also tested whether our richness models performed better than a null model of altitudinal changes of diversity based on the literature. Stacking of the ensemble prediction of the individual species models generated richness models that proved to be well correlated with the observed alpha diversity richness patterns along elevation and with the gamma diversity derived from the literature. Overall, these models tend to overpredict species richness. The use of the ensemble predictions from the species models built with different techniques seems very promising for modelling of species assemblages. Stacking of the binary models reduced the over-prediction, although more research is needed. The randomisation test proved to be a promising method for testing the performance of the stacked models, but other implementations may still be developed.

AB Multiple drivers of global environmental change are fundamentally altering essential basal resources, such as detritus. Metabolic processes in most aquatic ecosystems are supported by terrestrial detritus, which contributes to the production of organisms and the energetic stability of ecosystems. We suggest that conservation and management approaches to ecosystems along river networks must incorporate the organic-matter resources that support them. Understanding changes in the dynamics of detrital organic matter is particularly important because the quantity of this resource is decreasing and its qualities are being altered as a result of effects of current global changes. We summarize these effects in lotic ecosystems from reach- to network-scales and suggest future research questions aimed at adding quantitative rigor to our understanding of the interactions between dynamics of organic matter and ecological outcomes. This approach is a necessary next step to address large-scale changes in stream and river ecosystems that derive from fundamental alterations in detrital resources, which propagate through the foodweb base to higher-order consumers and emergent ecosystem properties.

AB The development of synoptic tools is required to derive the potential habitat of fin whales Balaenoptera physalus on a large-scale basis in the Mediterranean Sea, as the species has a largely unknown distribution and is at high risk of ship strike. We propose a foraging habitat model for fin whales in the western Mediterranean Sea relying on species ecology for the choice of predictors. The selected environmental variables are direct predictors and resource predictors available at daily and basin scales. Feeding habitat was determined mainly from the simultaneous occurrence of large oceanic fronts of satellite-derived sea-surface chlorophyll content (chl a) and temperature (SST). A specific range of surface chl a content (0.11 to 0.39 mg m(-3)) and a minimum water depth (92 m) were also identified to be important regional criteria. Daily maps were calibrated and evaluated against independent sets of fin whale sightings (presence data only). Specific chl a fronts represented the main predictor of feeding environment; therefore, derived habitat is a potential, rather than effective, habitat, but is functionally linked to a proxy of its resource (chl a production of fronts). The model performs well, with 80% of the presence data <9.7 km from the predicted potential habitat. The computed monthly, seasonal and annual maps of potential feeding habitat from 2000 to 2010 correlate, for the most part, with current knowledge on fin whale ecology. Overall, fin whale potential habitat occurs frequently during summer in dynamic areas of the general circulation, and is substantially more spread over the basin in winter. However, the results also displayed high year-to-year variations (40 to 50%), which are essential to consider when assessing migration patterns and recommending protection and conservation measures.

AB The social and economic importance of small-scale fisheries is frequently undervalued, and they are rarely effectively managed. There is now growing consensus on how these fisheries could be managed for sustainability and to minimize the risks of crossing undesirable thresholds. Using a concept developed in health care, these approaches have been referred to as primary fisheries management. By encouraging the use of best-available information in a precautionary way, the approaches will facilitate sustainable use and should therefore be encouraged, but they accept high scientific and implementation uncertainties as unavoidable because of limited management and enforcement resources and capacity. It is important to recognize that this limitation will result in social costs, because application of a precautionary approach in the face of high uncertainties will require forgoing potential sustainable benefits. Acceptance of primary fisheries management as a final and sufficient goal could therefore add a further constraint on the possibility of fishing communities escaping the poverty trap. Primary fisheries management should be seen as a first and minimum target for fisheries where there is currently no or inadequate management, but the longer-term goal should still be well informed and adaptive management that strives for optimal benefits, referred to here as tertiary management.

AB The caseinolytic protease (Clp) protease system has been expanded in plant plastids compared with its prokaryotic progenitors. The plastid Clp core protease consists of five different proteolytic ClpP proteins and four different noncatalytic ClpR proteins, with each present in one or more copies and organized in two heptameric rings. We determined the exact subunit composition and stoichiometry for the intact core and each ring. The chloroplast ClpP/R protease was affinity purified from clpr4 and clpp3 Arabidopsis thaliana null mutants complemented with C-terminal StrepII-tagged versions of CLPR4 and CLPP3, respectively. The subunit stoichiometry was determined by mass spectrometry-based absolute quantification using stable isotope-labeled proteotypic peptides generated from a synthetic gene. One heptameric ring contained ClpP3,4,5,6 in a 1:2:3:1 ratio. The other ring contained ClpP1 and ClpR1,2,3,4 in a 3:1:1:1:1 ratio, resulting in only three catalytic sites. These ClpP1/R1-4 proteins are most closely related to the two subunits of the cyanobacterial P3/R complex and the identical P: R ratio suggests conserved adaptation. Furthermore, the plant-specific C-terminal extensions of the ClpP/R subunits were not proteolytically removed upon assembly, suggesting a regulatory role in Clp chaperone interaction. These results will now allow testing ClpP/R structure-function relationships using rationale design. The quantification workflow we have designed is applicable to other protein complexes.

AB A FUNDAMENTAL NEED in conserving species and their habitats is defining distinct entities that range from individuals to species to ecosystems and beyond (Table 1; Ryder 1986, Moritz 1994, Mayden and Wood 1995, Haig and Avise 1996, Hazevoet 1996, Palumbi and Cipriano 1998, Hebert et al. 2004, Mace 2004, Wheeler et al. 2004, Armstrong and Ball 2005, Baker 2008, Ellis et al. 2010, Winker and Haig 2010). Rapid progression in this interdisciplinary field continues at an exponential rate; thus, periodic updates on theory, techniques, and applications are important for informing practitioners and consumers of genetic information. Here, we outline conservation topics for which genetic information can be helpful, provide examples of where genetic techniques have been used best in avian conservation, and point to current technical bottlenecks that prevent better use of genomics to resolve conservation issues related to birds. We hope this review will provide geneticists and avian ecologists with a mutually beneficial dialogue on how this integrated field can solve current and future problems.

AB In water-limited environments, photosynthetic carbon gain and loss of water by transpiration are in a permanent tradeoff as both are contrarily regulated by stomata conductance. In semiarid steppe grasslands water limitation may covary with nitrogen limitation. Steppe grassland species are capable of optimizing their use of limiting resources, water and nitrogen, but regulation is still poorly understood. In a two-year experiment with addition of water (irrigation simulating a wet year) and nitrogen (0, 25, and 50 kg urea-Nha(-1)) we assessed intrinsic water use efficiency (WUEi), nitrogen use efficiency (NUE), and related plant functional traits (PFTs) of four dominant C-3 species (Leymus chinensis, Agropyron cristatum, Stipa grandis, and Artemisia frigida). Water and N fertilizer supplementation significantly increased plant primary production, and N effect was more pronounced under irrigated conditions. Parallel with the responses of plant production, a strong tradeoff between WUEi and NUE was detected: water supply increased NUE but decreased WUEi, whereas N addition slightly increased WUEi at the expense of NUE. This tradeoff occurred at the leaf level, and involved the responses of leaf N concentration and specific leaf area. WUEi of species changed among treatments in a predictable manner by the parameter of leaf N content per area. Dominant plant species commonly achieved a higher utilization efficiency of the more limiting resource via altering PFTs, which was an important mechanism of adaptation to variable resource limitation in semiarid grasslands.

AB RNA interference (RNAi) is quickly emerging as a vital component of genome organization, gene regulation, and immunity in Drosophila and other species. Previous studies have suggested that, as a whole, genes involved in RNAi are under intense positive selection in Drosophila melanogaster. Here, we characterize the extent and patterns of adaptive evolution in 23 known Drosophila RNAi genes, both within D. rnelanogaster and across the Drosophila phylogeny. We find strong evidence for recurrent protein-coding adaptation at a large number of RNAi genes, particularly those involved in antiviral immunity and defense against transposable elements. We identify specific functional domains involved in direct protein-RNA interactions as particular hotspots of recurrent adaptation in multiple RNAi genes, suggesting that targeted coadaptive arms races may be a general feature of RNAi evolution. Our observations suggest a predictive model of how selective pressures generated by evolutionary arms race scenarios may affect multiple genes across protein interaction networks and other biochemical pathways.

AB The maintenance of genetic diversity is thought to be fundamental for the conservation of threatened species. It is therefore important to understand how genetic diversity is affected by the re-introduction of threatened species. We use establishment history and genetic data from the remnant and re-introduced populations of a New Zealand endemic bird, the hihi Notiomystis cincta, to understand genetic diversity loss and quantify the genetic effects of re-introduction. Our data do not support any recent bottleneck events in the remnant population. Furthermore, all genetic diversity measures indicate the remnant hihi population has retained high levels of genetic diversity relative to other New Zealand avifauna with similar histories of decline. Genetic diversity (N-A, alleles per locus, allelic richness, F-IS and H-S) did not significantly decrease in new hihi populations founded through re-introduction when compared to their source populations, except in the Kapiti Island population (allelic richness and H-S) which had very slow post-re-introduction population growth. The N-e/N-c ratio in the remnant population was high, but decreased in first-level re-introductions, which together with significant genetic differentiation between populations (F-ST & Fisher's exact tests) suggest that extant populations are diverging as a result of founder effects and drift. Importantly, simulations of future allele loss predict that the number of alleles lost will be higher in populations with a slow population growth, fewer founding individuals and with nonrandom mating. Interestingly, this species has very high levels of extra-pair paternity which may reduce reproductive variance by allowing social and floater males to reproduce a life history trait that together with a large remnant population size may help maintain higher levels of genetic diversity than expected.

AB Invasion patterns in Europe are uneven across habitats. In particular, temperate zonal forests are relatively little affected by invasions. However, long generation periods of forest species and the rarity of disturbance events may lead to long time lags, and so, invasion resistance of temperate forests may have been overestimated.
   Based on the inventory of the alien vascular flora of 15 study sites in East Austrian lowland forest patches adjacent to villages, we analysed diversity and temporal trends of their alien flora and the influence of within-habitat diversity, occurrence of forest areas dominated by alien tree species and adjacent land use diversity on the level of invasion.
   In total, we recorded 119 alien (neophyte) species. Species introduced by horticulture are of overriding importance (86% of all aliens). Using the year of first record in Austria as a proxy for local residence time, numbers of aliens have increased linearly by five species per decade since 1800. A GLM including the study site size and ratio of forest areas dominated by alien vs. native tree species explains 64% of the variance of the number of alien species. Size was more important, but the ratio of forest areas dominated by alien trees (Ailanthus altissima, Robinia pseudacacia) significantly increased alien species number.
   Our results show, that invasion of alien trees with strong impacts on ecosystem properties facilitates invasion in Central European forests, leading to "invasional meltdown". Further, high levels of propagule pressure, created by adjacent settlements and gardens, may foster invasions. Currently observed low levels of invasion in Central European forests situated in greater distance to settlements may turn out to be an ephemeral phenomenon. Spread of alien forest plants on the landscape level may ultimately, although possibly only over long time periods, lead to increased levels of invasion.

This 'Geometric Framework' takes account of the fact that animals need multiple nutrients in changing amounts and balance, and that nutrients come packaged in foods that are often hard to find, dangerous to subdue and costly to process. We then show how the Geometric Framework has been used to understand the links between nutrition and relevant aspects of the biology of individual animals. These aspects include the physiological mechanisms that direct the nutritional interactions of the animal with its environment, and the fitness consequences of these interactions. Having considered the implications of diet for individuals, we show that these effects can translate into the collective behaviour of groups and societies, and in turn ramify throughout food webs to influence the structure of ecosystems.

AB The Strait of Gibraltar (SG) is reputed for being both a bridge and a geographic barrier to biological exchanges between Europe and Africa. Major genetic breaks associated with this strait have been identified in various taxa, but it is unknown whether these disjunctions have been produced simultaneously or by independent biogeographic processes. Here, the genetic structure of five conifers distributed on both sides of the SG was investigated using mitochondrial (nad1 b/c, nad5-1, nad5-4 and nad7-1) and chloroplast (Pt1254, Pt15169, Pt30204, Pt36480, Pt71936 and Pt87268) DNA markers. The distribution of genetic variation was partially congruent between types of markers within the same species. Across taxa, there was a significant overlapping between the SG and the genetic breaks detected, especially for the four Tertiary species surveyed (Abies pinsapo complex, Pinus nigra, Pinus pinaster and Taxus baccata). For most of these taxa, the divergence of populations across the SG could date back to long before the Pleistocene glaciations. However, their strongly different cpDNA G(ST) and R-ST values point out that they have had dissimilar population histories, which might include contrasting amounts of pollen-driven gene flow since their initial establishment in the region. The fifth species, Pinus halepensis, was genetically depauperated and homogenous on both sides of the SG. A further analysis of nuclear DNA sequences with coalescent-based isolation with migration models suggests a Pleistocene divergence of P. halepensis populations across the SG, which is in sharp contrast with the pre-Pleistocene divergence dates obtained for P. pinaster. Altogether, these results indicate that the genetic breaks observed across this putative biogeographical barrier have been produced by independent evolutionary processes related to the biological history of each individual species instead of a common vicariant phenomenon.

AB Mediterranean streams are characterised by seasonal droughts, the frequency and intensity of which vary spatially and are expected to increase with global change. We studied the potential effects of drought and climate change on the fish assemblage and its trophic ecology in a Mediterranean stream by comparing an intermittent tributary with two more permanent neighbouring reaches. Although the three sites were dominated by the same two fish species, Mediterranean barbel (Barbus meridionalis) and chub (Squalius laietanus), the intermittent tributary had a lower overall fish density and fewer eel (Anguilla anguilla). The intermittent tributary had macroinvertebrates with lower density, smaller taxa and higher diversity. Fish in the intermittent tributary had significantly lower biomasses in their gut contents (adjusted for fish length) and more negative electivities than those in the permanent reaches, as well as significantly lower taxonomic diversity. These results indicate that there was reduced resource availability in the intermittent tributary, which resulted in significantly lower condition and gonadal weight (adjusted for length) of barbel and chub. The data obtained in this Mediterranean stream support the observation that reduced water flow may affect fish at both individual and assemblage levels.

AB Alpine ecosystems are harsh environments where low temperatures are generally a limiting factor. Predicted global warming is thus expected to have a profound impact on alpine ecosystems in the future. This study was conducted to compare the effect of experimental warming on soils in two contrasting forest ecosystems (a dragon spruce plantation and a natural forest) using the open top chamber (OTC) method in the Eastern Tibetan Plateau of China. The OTC enhanced average daily mean soil temperatures by 0.61A degrees C (plantation) and 0.55A degrees C (natural forest), respectively, throughout the growing season. Conversely, soil volumetric moisture declined by 4.10% in the plantation and by 2.55% in the natural forest. Across all measuring dates, warming increased average soil CO2 efflux by 10.6% in the plantation and by 15.4% in the natural forest. However, elevated temperatures did not affect the respiration quotient in either forest. Two-stage sulfuric acid hydrolysis was used to quantify labile and recalcitrant C and N fractions in the two contrasting soils. Warming significantly reduced labile C and N fractions in both ecosystems but did not influence the total, recalcitrant and microbial biomass C and N pools. Labile C, N and microbial biomass C showed significant interactions in warming x forest type x season. Irrespective of warming treatments, all measured pools were significantly larger in the natural forest compared to the plantation. Taken together, our results indicate that the lowered soil labile C and N pools may be induced by the increased soil CO2 efflux. The responses of the natural forest soil were more sensitive to experimental warming than those of the plantation. We conclude that reforestation dramatically lowers soil C and N pools, further affecting the responses of forest soils to future global warming.

AB Aquatic communities have been altered by invasive species, with impacts on native biodiversity and ecosystem function. At the same time, native biodiversity may mitigate the effects of an invader. Common carp (Cyprinus carpio) is a ubiquitous, invasive fish species that strongly influences community and ecosystem processes. We used common carp to test whether the potential effects of an invasive species are altered across a range of species diversity in native communities. In mesocosms, treatments of zero, one, three, and six native fish species were used to represent the nested subset patterns observed in fish communities of lakes in Illinois, USA. The effect of the invader was tested across fish richness treatments by adding common carp to the native community and substituting native biomass with common carp. Native species and intraspecific effects reduced invader growth. The invader reduced native fish growth; however, the negative effect was minimized with increasing native richness. The zooplankton grazer community was modified by a top-down effect from the invader that increased the amount of phytoplankton. Neither the invader nor richness treatments influenced total phosphorus or community metabolism. Overall, the invader reduced resources for native species, and the effect scaled with how the invader was incorporated into the community. Higher native diversity mitigated the impact of the invader, confirming the need to consider biodiversity when predicting the impacts of invasive species.

AB Uncertainties in the rate of biomass variation with forest ageing in tropical secondary forests, particularly in belowground components, limit the accuracy of carbon pool estimates in tropical regions. We monitored changes in above- and belowground biomass, leaf area index (LAI), and biomass allocation to the leaf component to determine the variation in carbon accumulation rate with forest age after shifting cultivation in Sarawak, Malaysia. Nine plots in a 4-year-old forest and fourteen plots in a 10-year-old forest were monitored for 5 and 7 years, respectively. Forest and plant part biomass were calculated from an allometric equation obtained from the same forest stands. Both above- and belowground biomass increased rapidly during the initial decade after abandonment. In contrast, a much slower rate of biomass accumulation was observed after the initial decade. LAI also increased by approximately double from the 4-year-old to 10-year-old forest, and then gently increased to the 17-year-old forest. We also found that allocation variation in leaf biomass and nitrogen was closely related to the rate of biomass accumulation as a forest aged. During the first decade after abandonment, a high biomass and nitrogen allocation to the leaf component may have allowed for a high rate of biomass accumulation. However, reduction in those allocations to leaf component after the initial decade may have helped to suppress the biomass accumulation rate in older secondary forests. Roots accounted for 14.0-16.1% of total biomass in the 4-17-year-old abandoned secondary forests. We also verified the model predicted values for belowground biomass by Cairns et al. (1997) and Mokany et al. (2006), although both models overestimated the values throughout our data sets by 45-50% in the 10-year-old forest. The low root:shoot ratio in the secondary forests may have caused this overestimation. Therefore, our results suggest that we should modify the models to estimate belowground biomass considering the low root:shoot ratio in tropical secondary forests. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB Considerable controversy exists concerning whether or not climate changes (particularly global warming) are causing outbreaks of a lethal amphibian pathogen, the chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Longcore, Pessier & D.K. Nichols 1999). In the present study, groups of Panamanian golden frogs (Atelopus zeteki Dunn, 1993), a critically endangered amphibian thought to be nearly extinct in Panama, were exposed to varying dosages of zoospores of Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, temperatures and hydric environments in order to learn whether this species is susceptible to this pathogen and, if so, how environmental factors affect survival. This pathogen proved to be highly lethal for A. zeteki. Frogs exposed to a dosage of 100 Bd zoospores survived significantly (P < 0.0001) longer than those that had been exposed to 104 or 106 zoospores. Exposed frogs housed at 23 degrees C survived significantly (P < 0.0001) longer than those that were housed at 17 degrees C. Exposed frogs held in dry conditions survived significantly longer than those in wet conditions (P < 0.0001). As a laboratory study, these results do not directly test hypotheses about the relation between climate change and the decline of these frogs in the field, but they inform the discussion about how environmental conditions can have an impact on the interaction between a susceptible amphibian and this pathogen. These data do not support the contention that rising global temperatures are necessary to cause the death of amphibians infected with this pathogen because the pathogen was equally lethal at 17 as at 23 degrees C, and frogs at the warmer temperature lived significantly longer than those at the cooler one.

AB Understanding how new phenotypes evolve is challenging because intermediate stages in transitions from ancestral to derived phenotypes often remain elusive. Here we describe and evaluate a new mechanism facilitating the transition from sexual reproduction to parthenogenesis. In many sexually reproducing species, a small proportion of unfertilized eggs can hatch spontaneously ('tychoparthenogenesis') and develop into females. Using an analytical model, we show that if females are mate-limited, tychoparthenogenesis can result in the loss of males through a positive feedback mechanism whereby tychoparthenogenesis generates female-biased sex ratios and increasing mate limitation. As a result, the strength of selection for tychoparthenogenesis increases in concert with the proportion of tychoparthenogenetic offspring in the sexual population. We then tested the hypothesis that mate limitation selects for tychoparthenogenesis and generates female-biased sex ratios, using data from natural populations of sexually reproducing Timema stick insects. Across 41 populations, both the tychoparthenogenesis rates and the proportions of females increased exponentially as the density of individuals decreased, consistent with the idea that low densities of individuals result in mate limitation and selection for reproductive insurance through tychoparthenogenesis. Our model and data from Timema populations provide evidence for a simple mechanism through which parthenogenesis can evolve rapidly in a sexual population.

AB It is well known that microbial-mediated soil respiration, the major source of CO2 from terrestrial ecosystems, is sensitive to temperature. Here, we hypothesize that some mechanisms, such as acclimation of microbial respiration to temperature and/or regulation by plant fresh C inputs of the temperature sensitivity of decomposition of soil organic matter (SOM), should be taken into account to predict soil respiration correctly. Specifically, two hypotheses were tested: (1) under warm conditions, temperature sensitivity (Q(10)) and basal rates of microbial-mediated soil respiration (Bs(20,) respiration at a given temperature) would be primarily subjected to presence/absence of plant fresh C inputs; and (2) under cold conditions, where labile C depletion occurred more slowly, microbial-mediated soil respiration could adjust its optimal temperatures to colder temperatures (acclimation), resulting in a net increase of respiration rates for a given temperature (Bs(20)). For this purpose, intact soil cores from an oak savanna ecosystem were incubated with sufficient water supply at two contrasting temperatures (10 and 30A degrees C) during 140 days. To study temperature sensitivity of soil respiration, short-term temperature cycles (from 5 to 40A degrees C at 8 h steps) were applied periodically to the soils. Our results confirmed both hypotheses. Under warm conditions ANCOVA and likelihood ratio tests confirmed that both Q(10) and Bs(20) decreased significantly during the incubation. Further addition of glucose at the end of the incubation period increased Bs(20) and Q(10) to initial values. The observed decrease in temperature sensitivity (Q(10)) in absence of labile C disagrees with the broadly accepted fact that temperature sensitivity of the process increases as quality of the substrate decreases. Our experiment also shows that after 2 months of incubation cold-incubated soils doubled the rates of respiration at cold temperatures causing a strong increase in basal respiration rates (Bs(20)). This suggest that microbial community may have up-regulated their metabolism at cold conditions (cold-acclimation), which also disagrees with most observations to date. The manuscript discusses those two apparent contradictions: the decrease in temperature sensitivity in absence of labile C and the increase in microbial-mediated soil respiration rates at cold temperatures. While this is only a case study, the trends observed could open the controversy over the validity of current soil respiration models.

AB Expert elicitation is the process of retrieving and quantifying expert knowledge in a particular domain. Such information is of particular value when the empirical data is expensive, limited or unreliable. This paper describes a new software tool, called Elicitator, which assists in quantifying expert knowledge in a form suitable for use as a prior model in Bayesian regression. Potential environmental domains for applying this elicitation tool include habitat modelling, assessing detectability or eradication, ecological condition assessments, risk analysis and quantifying inputs to complex models of ecological processes. The tool has been developed to be user-friendly, extensible and facilitate consistent and repeatable elicitation of expert knowledge across these various domains. We demonstrate its application to elicitation for logistic regression in a geographically based ecological context. The underlying statistical methodology is also novel, utilizing an indirect elicitation approach to target expert knowledge on a case-by-case basis. For several elicitation sites (or cases), experts are asked simply to quantify their estimated ecological response (e. g. probability of presence), and its range of plausible values, after inspecting (habitat) covariates via GIS.

AB Conservation strategies for endangered species require accurate and precise estimates of abundance. Unfortunately, obtaining unbiased estimates can be difficult due to inappropriate estimator models and study design. We evaluate population-density estimators for tigers Panthera tigris in Kanha Tiger Reserve, India, using camera traps in conjunction with telemetry (n=6) in a known minimum population of 14 tigers. An effort of 462 trap nights over 42 days yielded 44 photographs of 12 adult tigers. Using closed population estimators, the best-fit model (program capture) accounted for individual heterogeneity (M-h). The least biased and precise population estimate ((n) over cap (SE) [(n) over cap]) was obtained by the M-h Jackknife 1 (JK1) [14 (1.89)] in program care-2. Tiger density ((D) over cap (SE) [(D) over cap]) per 100 km(2) was estimated at 13 (2.08) when the effective trapping area was estimated using the half mean maximum distance moved (1/2 MMDM), 8.1 (2.08), using the home-range radius, 7.8 (1.59), with the full MMDM and 8.0 (3.0) with the spatial likelihood method in program density 4.1. The actual density of collared tigers (3.27 per 100 km2) was closely estimated by home-range radius at 3.9 (0.76), full MMDM at 3.48 (0.81) and spatial likelihood at 3.78 (1.54), but overestimated by 1/2 MMDM at 6 (0.81) tigers per 100 km(2). Sampling costs (Rs. 450 per camera day) increased linearly with camera density, while the precision of population estimates leveled off at 25 cameras per 100 km(2). At simulated low tiger densities, a camera density of 50 per 100 km(2) with an effort of 8 trap nights km(-2) provided 95% confidence coverage, but estimates lacked precision.

AB Little is known about local extinctions of finfish species in the most biodiverse marine ecosystem in the most marine biodiverse and anthropogenically threatened region on Earth. This paper examines coral reef associated finfish species that disappeared in the catches around the island of Bohol over the period 1950 to 2007, based on the only available data, namely traditional ecological knowledge. Generalized least squares (GLS) tests showed steep declines to zero among species formerly recorded in catches. Finfish species recommended as priority for further monitoring based on life history and disappearances in fish catch are giant grouper (Epinephelus lanceolatus) and African pompano (Alectis ciliaris). Twenty out of the 21 species that disappeared from catches were moderate to very large-bodied, six were slow-growing fish and Four were late-maturing fish. Species of large body size and subject to high fishing pressure may be particularly vulnerable. Traditional ecological knowledge when applied to population dynamics studies can add value to development of new monitoring methods. This knowledge can moreover inform the prioritization of species for fisheries assessment and conservation action.

AB Female seed beetles, Callosobruchus maculatus, mate multiply even though association with males and copulations carry costs, such as injury to the genital tract. Multiple mating (polyandry) may, however, offset these costs through the acquisition of food and water, two material benefits hypothesized to be obtained from the large ejaculates produced by males. The material benefits hypothesis can be tested by increasing female access to nutrients and water, with the prediction that female mating frequency will decrease as copulation is no longer required to derive these materials. Females were given water, 5% sugar-water or baker's yeast, and were compared with females deprived of these. We presented females with virgin males daily for 8 days and recorded female mating frequency, survivorship, and fecundity. Females provided with water and sugar-water decreased mating frequency. Thus, water, rather than nutrients in the ejaculate, appears to be important to females of this species. In addition, both life span and fecundity were extended for females in the sugar-water and water treatments. Since water is scarce in the arid environment in which this species is found, we conclude that polyandry provides material benefits to females that may offset some of the costs of associating with males.

AB Restoration of degraded landscapes through replantings of native vegetation has been proceeding in response to habitat loss and fragmentation and plummeting biodiversity. Little is known about whether the investments in ecological restoration have resulted in biodiversity benefits. We evaluated the potential of restored sites to support populations by assessing bird breeding activity. We surveyed 21 revegetated sites of various ages (9-111 years) in the box-ironbark region of Victoria, Australia. Sites differed in landscape context, patch features and in-site characteristics. The latter, including whether sites were grazed, amounts of fallen timber and numbers of remnant trees, were most important in affecting overall bird breeding activity. Patch-configuration (e.g., shape, area) was of secondary importance. Landscape context appeared to have little effect on bird breeding except for one species. While these results suggest that in-site habitat structure is the predominant driver, we caution against dismissing the importance of patch characteristics and landscape context for two reasons. First, the available sites covered a relatively small range of areas (< 54 ha), and we could not provide a broad range of landscape-contextual contrasts given that we could only use existing plantings. Second, much of the breeding activity was by bird species known to be tolerant of smaller woodland areas or of the open countryside. We show that there is very little breeding activity in replantings by species that have declined dramatically in rank abundance between large 'reference' areas and fragmented landscapes. It seems likely that most replantings provide habitat configurations unsuited for dealing with declines of species most vulnerable to habitat loss and fragmentation.

AB Raised beds are widely used in agriculture in developed countries and have proven to be an excellent option for wheat. Permanent raised beds may also offer benefits for rice-wheat (RW) systems in South Asia, in terms of both production and the possibility that furrow-irrigation may be more efficient than flood irrigation. The performance of a RW system on permanent raised beds (37 cm wide, 15 cm high, furrow width 30 cm) was compared with conventional cultivation on the flat on sandy loam and loam soils in replicated experiments in central Punjab, India. The experiments commenced with wheat sown in November 2002, and were continued for 8 crops.
   Yields of conventionally tilled wheat (CTW) ranged from 3.6 to 4.9 t ha(-1) and tended to be higher on the loam than on the sandy loam. Yields of wheat on fresh and permanent beds (WB and DDWB, respectively) were similar to yields on CTW and direct-drilled wheat on the flat (DDW) except when establishment was sub-optimal on the beds on both soils in 2004-2005. It was also lower on the beds on the sandy loam in 2002-2003 when tillering did not compensate for the lower sowing rate on the beds. In each case, the poorer performance on beds appeared to be associated with the more rapid drying of the beds than the flats, and thus the need for greater precision in irrigation and sowing management with beds on sandy loam and loam soils. Yield on beds relative to flats did not change as the beds aged.
   Yields of transplanted rice on permanent beds (TRB) were depressed relative to yields of puddled transplanted rice (PTR) with the same alternate wetting and drying water management, regardless of age of the bed (from 1st to 8th crop) and soil type. Yields of TRB relative to PTR declined as the beds aged, over the first 2-3 years, from about 80 to 90% to less than 50% of PTR. Biomass production in TRB was always significantly less than in M, starting from 35 d after transplanting. Performance of direct-seeded rice on beds (DSRB) was even poorer. Serious root knot nematode infestation was also a serious problem in transplanted rice on the sandy loam in the absence of continuous flooding, on both TRB and PTR. The DSRB suffered from severe iron deficiency each year on both soils despite several iron sprays beginning as early as 15 days after transplanting, and yields declined from about 60% of PTR with the same irrigation scheduling in the first rice crop to less than 25% of PTR in the third rice crop.
   Total annual system productivity was highest using puddled transplanted rice (PTR) in rotation with fresh beds (WB) for wheat, CTW or DDW on the flat. Average productivity of these systems over the first 4 years was 9.5 t ha(-1) y(-1) on a sandy loam soil and 10.3 t ha(-1) y(-1) on a loam soil. Productivity of RW on permanent raised beds with transplanted rice declined as the beds aged, and averaged 77-79% of the productivity of the best systems mainly due to declining yield of TRB relative to PTR. Averaged over the first 3 years, productivity of permanent beds with direct-seeded rice (DSRB) was even lower (only 62-68% of the best systems) due to much lower yields of DSRB.
   Permanent bed RW systems seem to have limited potential under the prevailing soil and climatic conditions of Punjab. India, with current varieties and management. Further research on permanent raised beds for RW systems should focus on the selection of suitable rice and wheat cultivars, soil health issues such as nematodes and iron deficiency, weed control, irrigation scheduling, N management and soil compaction.

AB Harvesting of wildlife populations by humans is usually targeted by sex, age or phenotypic criteria, and is therefore selective. Selective harvesting has the potential to elicit a genetic response from the target populations in several ways. First, selective harvesting may affect population demographic structure (age structure, sex ratio), which in turn may have consequences for effective population size and hence genetic diversity. Second, wildlife-harvesting regimes that use selective criteria based on phenotypic characteristics (e.g. minimum body size, horn length or antler size) have the potential to impose artificial selection on harvested populations. If there is heritable genetic variation for the target characteristic and harvesting occurs before the age of maturity, then an evolutionary response over time may ensue. Molecular ecological techniques offer ways to predict and detect genetic change in harvested populations, and therefore have great utility for effective wildlife management. Molecular markers can be used to assess the genetic structure of wildlife populations, and thereby assist in the prediction of genetic impacts by delineating evolutionarily meaningful management units. Genetic markers can be used for monitoring genetic diversity and changes in effective population size and breeding systems. Tracking evolutionary change at the phenotypic level in the wild through quantitative genetic analysis can be made possible by genetically determined pedigrees. Finally, advances in genome sequencing and bioinformatics offer the opportunity to study the molecular basis of phenotypic variation through trait mapping and candidate gene approaches. With this understanding, it could be possible to monitor the selective impacts of harvesting at a molecular level in the future. Effective wildlife management practice needs to consider more than the direct impact of harvesting on population dynamics. Programs that utilize molecular genetic tools will be better positioned to assess the long-term evolutionary impact of artificial selection on the evolutionary trajectory and viability of harvested populations.

AB Continued genome sequencing has fueled progress in statistical methods for understanding the action of natural selection at the molecular level. This article reviews various statistical techniques (and their applicability) for detecting adaptation events and the functional divergence of proteins. As large- scale automated studies become more frequent, they provide a useful resource for generating biological null hypotheses for further experimental and statistical testing. Furthermore, they shed light on typical patterns of lineage-specific evolution of organisms, on the functional and structural evolution of protein families and on the interplay between the two. More complex models are being developed to better reflect the underlying biological and chemical processes and to complement simpler statistical models. Linking molecular processes to their statistical signatures in genomes can be demanding, and the proper application of statistical models is discussed.

AB Water abstraction can alter invertebrate community composition by changing the availability or suitability of habitat for invertebrates. The consequences of water abstraction for the physical habitat and invertebrate communities of small permanent streams are not clear. Therefore, we used whole-channel flow manipulations to imitate real water abstractions. We used weirs and diversions to reduce discharge by >85% in 3 small New Zealand streams (mean discharges: 11-84 L/s), ranging in water quality from pristine to moderately polluted. We sampled benthic invertebrates and periphyton at control and impact sites on each stream before and during 2 mo of artificially reduced discharge during summer 2005, and then we left the diversions in operation throughout the following year and sampled invertebrates again after 9 and 12 mo of flow reduction. During the experiment, wetted width decreased by 24 to 34% at impact sites. Water velocity and depth also decreased at impact sites, but only small changes to conductivity, pH, dissolved O-2, and temperature were observed. At the pristine site, density of invertebrates and percentage of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera (EPT) individuals decreased in response to reduced flows. Only taxonomic richness decreased at the mildly polluted stream, and reduced discharge had no effect on the invertebrate community at the stream with the poorest water quality. Overall community structure also changed in response to flow reduction at all but the poorest-water-quality stream. Alterations to community composition involved changes in the density of common taxa and collection of fewer rare taxa per sample. Our results indicate that the impacts of water abstraction on invertebrate communities differ between streams that vary in water quality, probably because of the relative sensitivities of invertebrate communities to changes in the physical habitat of these streams.

AB There has been considerable debate on whether root/rhizosphere respiration or bulk soil respiration is more sensitive to long-term temperature changes. We investigated the response of belowground respiration to soil warming by 3 degrees C above ambient in bare soil plots and plots planted with wheat and maize. Initially, belowground respiration responded more to the soil warming in bare soil plots than in planted plots. However, as the growing season progressed, a greater soil-warming response developed in the planted plots as the contribution of root/rhizosphere respiration to belowground respiration declined. A negative correlation was observed between the contribution of root/rhizosphere respiration to total belowground respiration and the magnitude of the soil-warming response indicating that bulk soil respiration is more temperature sensitive than root/rhizosphere respiration. The dependence of root/rhizosphere respiration on substrate provision from photosynthesis is the most probable explanation for the observed lower temperature sensitivity of root/rhizosphere respiration. At harvest in late September, final crop biomass did not differ between the two soil temperature treatments in either the maize or wheat plots. Postharvest, flux measurements during the winter months indicated that the response of belowground respiration to the soil-warming treatment increased in magnitude (response equated to a Q(10) value of 5.7 compared with similar to 2.3 during the growing season). However, it appeared that this response was partly caused by a strong indirect effect of soil warming. When measurements were made at a common temperature, belowground respiration remained higher in the warmed subplots suggesting soil warming had maintained a more active microbial community through the winter months. It is proposed that any changes in winter temperatures, resulting from global warming, could alter the sink strength of terrestrial ecosystems considerably.

AB Measurements of leaf gas exchange were made in contrasting wooded ecosystems in West Africa. Measurements were made on 10 species: seven from humid rain forest in Cameroon and three from the semi-arid Sahelian zone in Niger. For each species, two models of photosynthesis were fitted: the first based on a rectangular hyperbolic response to photosynthetic photon flux density (Q), and the second the biochemical model of Farquhar et al. (1980). In both communities, the species studied could be divided into those characteristic of early and late successional stages, but photosynthetic parameters were not closely related to successional stage. The data identified significant relationships between V-cmax and leaf nutrient (N and P) content when expressed on an area basis. Variation in leaf mass per unit area correlated with canopy exposure and dominated the leaf nutrient signal. Statistical analysis suggested weakly that leaf gas exchange was more limited by P than N at the rain forest site.

AB The highly invasive giant knotweed (Reynoutria spp.) often displaces nettle (Urtica dioica) dominated stands in European floodplains. Urtica-dominated stands differ from the monospecific Reynoutria stands in plant species richness and stand structure. We thus hypothesize that Reynoutria invasion profoundly alters ecosystem structure and function, with negative effects cascading up through the food chain. We performed a paired sampling design in six sites belonging to two different locations and studied effects on the soil and the litter-dwelling fauna. Reynoutria stands differed in habitat structure and were characterized by decreased soil pH and potassium depletion. The faunal analysis is based on model groups of herbivore generalists (Gastropoda), detritivores (Isopoda and Diplopoda), and predators (Opiliones). The gastropod assemblages from Reynoutria stands were severely impoverished subsets of those from Urtica stands with reduced densities, species richness and diversity. In general, snails were more sensitive to Reynoutria invasion than slugs such as the invasive Arion 'lusitanicus'. Among detritivores, the abundance of the Isopoda decreased, whereas Diplopoda were not affected by Reynoutria invasion. Yet, the relative abundance of detritivores was significantly higher within the Reynoutria stands. Abundance, species richness and diversity of the predatory Opiliones were higher in the relatively sparse Reynoutria stands. We conclude that ecosystem changes associated with Reynoutria invasion are characterized by shifts from a plant-based to a detritus-based food chain and that Reynoutria invasion primarily enhances predators that profit from the simplified vegetation structure.

AB The goals of this study were to identify habitats occupied by the Eurasian grass Bothriochloa ischaemum (King Ranch bluestem) on the eastern Edwards Plateau of central Texas, USA, and to measure the effects of this invasive species on plant diversity. A set of descriptive field studies were conducted to determine the relationships between habitat characteristics (woody cover, slope, presence of roads and trails, history of prescribed burning, and presence of grazing) and the presence and abundance of this species. Species richness and diversity of perennial herbaceous species were compared between plots in which B. ischaemum was absent and plots that it dominated. The only habitat in which B. ischaemum was never found was under the canopies of woody plants. B. ischaemum grew in plots of all inclinations (flat sites to steep hillsides), with little evidence of habitat preference. B. ischaemum was more often, although not exclusively, found in plots near roads, probably because roads facilitate seed dispersal. There was no significant relationship between either grazing or fire history and the distribution of this species. B. ischaemum-dominated plots had lower species diversity and species richness than plots in which no B. ischaemum was found. The results of this study confirm that B. ischaemum is very common on the eastern Edwards Plateau and suggest that it will continue to spread throughout this region and to reduce native herbaceous plant diversity there.

AB The impact of nitrogen (N) supply on the temperature response of root respiratory O-2 uptake (R) was assessed in several herbaceous species grown in solution culture. Warm-grown (25 : 20 degrees C, day:night) plants differing in root N concentration were shifted to 13 : 8 degrees C for 7 d to cold-acclimate.
   Log-log plots of root R vs root N concentration both showed that R increased with increasing tissue N concentration, irrespective of the growth temperature. Although the regression slopes of the log-log plots did not differ between the warm-grown and cold-acclimated plants, cold-acclimated plants did exhibit a higher y-axis intercept than their warm-grown counterparts. This suggests that cold acclimation of root R is not entirely dependent on cold-induced increases in tissue N concentration and that scaling relationships (i.e. regression equations fitted to the log-log plots) between root R and N concentration are not fixed.
   No systematic differences were found in the short-term Quo (proportional change in R per 10 degrees C change in temperature), or degree of cold acclimation (as measured by the proportional difference between warm- and cold-acclimated roots) among roots differing in root N concentration. The temperature response of root R is therefore insensitive to tissue N concentration.
   The insensitivity of Q(10) values and acclimation to tissue N concentration raises the possibility that root R and its temperature sensitivity can be predicted for a range of N supply scenarios.

AB Peregrine falcon populations underwent devastating declines in the mid-20th century due to the bioaccumulation of organochlorine contaminants, becoming essentially extirpated east of the Great Plains and significantly reduced elsewhere in North America. Extensive re-introduction programs and restrictions on pesticide use in Canada and the United States have returned many populations to predecline sizes. A proper population genetic appraisal of the consequences of this decline requires an appropriate context defined by (i) meaningful demographic entities; and (ii) suitable reference populations. Here we explore the validity of currently recognized subspecies designations using data from the mitochondrial control region and 11 polymorphic microsatellite loci taken from 184 contemporary individuals from across the breeding range, and compare patterns of population genetic structure with historical patterns inferred from 95 museum specimens. Of the three North American subspecies, the west coast marine subspecies Falco peregrinus pealei is well differentiated genetically in both time periods using nuclear loci. In contrast, the partitioning of continental Falco peregrinus anatum and arctic Falco peregrinus tundrius subspecies is not substantiated, as individuals from these subspecies are historically indistinguishable genetically. Bayesian clustering analyses demonstrate that contemporary genetic differentiation between these two subspecies is mainly due to changes within F. p. anatum (specifically the southern F. p. anatum populations). Despite expectations and a variety of tests, no genetic bottleneck signature is found in the identified populations; in fact, many contemporary indices of diversity are higher than historical values. These results are rationalized by the promptness of the recovery and the possible introduction of new genetic material.

AB In this study, we have examined several physiological, biochemical and morphological features of Buddleja davidii plants growing at 1300 m above sea level (a.s.l.) and 3400 m a.s.l., respectively, to identify coordinated changes in leaf properties in response to reduced CO2 partial pressure (P-a). Our results confirmed previous findings that foliar delta C-13, photosynthetic capacity and foliar N concentration on a leaf area basis increased, whereas stomatal conductance (g(s)) decreased with elevation. The net CO2 assimilation rate (A(max)), maximum rate of electron transport (J(max)) and respiration increased significantly with elevation, although no differences were found in carboxylation efficiency of Rubisco (V-cmax). Consequently, also the J(max) to V-cmax ratio was significantly increased by elevation, indicating that the functional balance between Ribulose- 1,5-biphosphate (RuBP) consumption and RuBP regeneration changes as elevation increases. Our results also indicated a homeostatic response Of CO2 transfer conductance inside the leaf (mesophyll conductance, g(m)) to increasing elevation. In fact, with elevation, g(m) also increased compensating for the strong decrease in g(m) and, thus, in the P-i (intercellular partial pressure Of CO2) to P-a ratio, leading to similar chloroplast partial pressure of CO2 (P-c) to P-a ratio at different elevations. Because there were no differences in V-cmax, also A measured at similar PPFD and leaf temperature did not differ statistically with elevation. As a consequence, a clear relationship was found between A and g(m), and between A and the sum of g(s) and g(m). These data suggest that the higher dry mass delta C-13 of leaves at the higher elevation, indicative of lower long-term P-c/P-a ratio, cannot be attributed to changes either in diffusional resistances or in carboxylation efficiency. We speculate that because temperature significantly decreases as the elevation increases, it dramatically affects CO2 diffusion and hence P-c/P-a and, consequently, is the primary factor influencing C-13 discrimination at high elevation.

AB To enrich the Hennigian internodal conception of species, a new formalization of the definition of the species concept is proposed. This rigorous definition allows for considerable unification of the various, and sometimes conflicting, techniques of species delimitation used in practice. First, the domain of such a definition is set out, namely, the set of all organisms on Earth, past, present, and future. Next, the focus is on the genealogical relationship among organisms, which provides the key to analysing the giant or global genealogical network (GGN) connecting all these organisms. This leads to the construction of an algorithm revealing the topological structure of the GGN, from families to lineages, ending up with a definition of species as equivalence classes of organisms corresponding to branches of the 'tree of life'. Such a theoretical definition of the species concept must be accompanied by various recognition criteria to be operational. These criteria are, for example, the ill-named 'biological species concepts', 'phylogenetic species concepts', etc., usually, but wrongly, presented as definitions of the species concept. Besides clarifying this disputed point, the definition in the present study displays the huge diversity of the scales (time-scale and population size) involved in actual species, thus explaining away the classical problems raised by previous attempts at defining the species concept (uniparental reproduction, temporal depth of species, and hybridization).

AB Aim To determine if the distributions of lizard species from Seasonally Dry Tropical Forest (SDTF) enclaves within the Cerrado biome in central Brazil are associated with the Tropical Seasonal Forests Region, a recently proposed phytogeographic unit of South America, corroborating the existence of a Pleistocenic Arc of SDTFs.
   Location SDTF remnants in the Parana River valley, municipality of Sao Domingos, Goias, Brazil.
   Methods Lizards were extensively sampled using haphazard sampling, funnel traps, and pitfall traps with drift fences during four expeditions. The composition of the SDTF lizard assemblage was compared with those from other South American phytogeographic regions (Caatinga, Cerrado, Chaco, Llanos, and the dry forests of Colombia and Bolivia), based on the literature and our own unpublished data.
   Results The SDTF lizard assemblage contained 20 species, including 11 species with extensive distributions among the regions considered, seven species shared exclusively with Cerrado localities, a single species shared exclusively with other SDTFs, and one endemic species. The presence of Lygodactylusklugei (Smith, Martin & Swain, 1977), presumably endemic to the Pleistocenic Arc formed by the Tropical Seasonal Forests Region, considerably extends the known distribution of this species, suggesting historical connections between Caatinga and Cerrado SDTF enclaves.
   Main conclusions The composition of the lizard assemblage in Cerrado SDTF enclaves seems to corroborate the recent proposal that the SDTF should be recognized as a phytogeographic unit (or dominium). The presence of disjunct populations and endemic species highlights the urgency of considering the uniqueness of the Parana River valley SDTFs and the importance of its conservation.

AB The development of methods to analyze habitat selection when resources are defined by several categories (e.g., vegetation types) is a topical issue in radio-tracking studies. The White and Garrott statistic, an extension of the widely used test of Neu et al., can be used to determine whether habitat selection is significant. As well, Manly's selection ratio, a particularly useful measure of resource selectivity by resource users, allows detection of the most strongly selected habitat types. However, when both the number of animals and types of habitat are large, the biologist often has to deal with an excessively large number of measures. In this paper we present a new method, the eigenanalysis of selection ratios, that generalizes these two common methods within the framework of eigenanalyses. This method undertakes an additive linear partitioning of the White and Garrott statistic, so that the difference between habitat use and availability is maximized on the first factorial axes. The eigenanalysis of selection ratios is therefore optimal in habitat selection studies. Although we primarily consider the case where the habitat availability is the same for all animals ( design II), we also extend this analysis to the case where the habitat availability varies from one animal to another ( design III). An application of this method is provided using radio-tracking data collected on 17 squirrels in five habitat types. The results indicate variability in habitat selection, with two groups of animals displaying two patterns of preference. This difference between the two groups is explained by the patch structure of the study area. Because this method is mainly exploratory, and therefore does not rely on any distributional assumption, we recommend its use in studies of habitat selection.

AB In recent works, methods have been proposed for applying phylogenetic models that allow for a general interdependence between the amino acid positions of a protein. As of yet, such models have focused on site interdependencies resulting from sequence-structure compatibility constraints, using simplified structural representations in combination with a set of statistical potentials. This structural compatibility criterion is meant as a proxy for sequence fitness, and the methods developed thus far can incorporate different site-interdependent fitness proxies based on other measurements. However, no methods have been proposed for comparing and evaluating the adequacy of alternative fitness proxies in this context, or for more general comparisons with canonical models of protein evolution. In the present work, we apply Bayesian methods of model selection-based on numerical calculations of marginal likelihoods and posterior predictive checks-to evaluate models encompassing the site-interdependent framework. Our application of these methods indicates that considering site-interdependencies, as done here, leads to an improved model fit for all data sets studied. Yet, we find that the use of pairwise contact potentials alone does not suitably account for across-site rate heterogeneity or amino acid exchange propensities; for such complexities, site-independent treatments are still called for. The most favored models combine the use of statistical potentials with a suitably rich site-independent model. Altogether, the methodology employed here should allow for a more rigorous and systematic exploration of different ways of modeling explicit structural constraints, or any other site-interdependent criterion, while best exploiting the richness of previously proposed models.

AB Indo-Pacific bottlenose (Tursiops aduncus) and humpback dolphins (Sousa chinensis) off the south coast of Zanzibar, East Africa, have been subject to both direct and indirect takes as well as disturbance from local dolphin tourism during the last decade. Meanwhile, little or no information on population parameters exists for these animals. In order to assess the anthropogenic threats, a study was conducted between 1999 and 2002 to determine population sizes, distribution, and behavior of these animals. Population sizes were calculated for each year using mark-recapture methods applied to photo-identification data. The estimates ranged between 136 and 179 for the bottlenose dolphins and between 58 and 65 for the humpback dolphins in the calculated 26 km(2) study area. Patterns in distribution and behavior were investigated using image and spatial statistic software on data from boat surveys. Analyses of spatial densities showed that both species concentrated their activities to smaller areas (2%-11.5%) within the study area. When the study results were considered in light of the anthropogenic threats, it was clear that immediate conservation measures were needed. This is critical if the negative impact on the species is to be minimized and the dolphins are to continue to represent a socioeconomic resource in the region.

AB This paper is the first of its kind in Indonesia where effects of artisanal fishing pressure from particular gear types shows an influence on the biomass of reef fish families measured by visual census. Surveys of reef fish communities and benthic variables at 36 fishing grounds, of varying fishing pressure, showed that Scaridae abundance was the factor most influencing fish community structure. The positive relationships between algal turf and reef fish variables and the negative relationships between hard coral cover and three reef fish variables (Scaridae biomass, herbivore biomass and fish species richness) suggests that substrate variables may be used to predict reef fish community variables and that herbivorous fish promote algal turfs at the expense of other benthos. Relationships between reef fish guilds and fishing pressure showed a strong negative impact of muro-ami and gill netting on seven families of reef fish. The strong influence of netting on Caesonidae and Lethrinidae biomass was consistent with the targeting of these families by these fishing methods in Karimunjawa. Both gillnets and muro-ami netting were also negatively correlated with invertivores, a trophic group consisting of a range of reef fish families in Karimunjawa. Although the low biomass of fish populations is likely associated with past and existing fishing practices, negative relationships between fishing pressure indices and reef fish biomass were consistent with the selectivity of families by different fishing gears in Karimunjawa. The implication for management is that both non-selective gears (netting) and selective fishing practices (e.g., handspear and speargun) are capable of modifying the structure of reef fish populations and require active management controls.

AB Sicyopterus lagocephahis is a Gobiidae Sicydiinae (Telcostei) thought to inhabit Indo-Pacific island rivers from Comoros Islands in the Indian Ocean to Australs Islands (French Polynesia) in the Pacific Ocean. Its biological cycle comprises a marine planctonic larval phase of several months allowing it to migrate from island to island, but the other species of the genus, with such a larval stage, have generally a more restricted range and are often endemic. To understand the organisation of a species with such a wide distribution, mtDNA cytochrome b sequences were amplified for 55 specimens of this genus covering most of its distribution range together with six close endemic species and other gobiids used as outgroups. The main result is the confirmation of the ubiquity of S. lagocephaltis that occurs over a range of 18,000 km in the Indian and Pacific Oceans. Two clades were identified within this species, one clustering most of French Polynesian haplotypes and the other clustering most of Mascarene (including Comoros) haplotypes. The overall pattern of distribution and phylogenetic relationship suggests that the lineages leading to endemic species originated earlier than S. lagocephalus. This latter seems to be a secondary migrant species, having colonised both Indian and Pacific Oceans with a few exceptions, situated at the border of the range (Madagascar, Marquesas, Rapa). According to the results, the phylogeny of the Sicyoplerus group, the age of the different lineages and the past history of the colonisation of the Indo-Pacific islands are discussed.

AB The cushion plant Azorella selago is widespread across the sub-Antarctic, and is considered a keystone species in the dominant fellfield vegetation. However, the impact of current changes in climate in the region (increasing temperature and declining rainfall) on this species is unknown. Here, the response of A. selago to reduced rainfall (a direct effect of climate change) and increased shading (a predicted indirect effect of increasing temperatures, via enhanced growth and wider distribution of more responsive competitors and epiphytes) was experimentally determined. Reduced rainfall increased stem mortality and accelerated autumnal senescence. Furthermore, under this treatment senescence was unequally distributed across individual plants, hypothesized to be a consequence of an interactive effect between rainfall and wind patterns. Shaded stems grew more, and carried larger leaves with lower trichome densities, than their exposed equivalents. As a result, shaded plants were less compact and their surface integrity reduced. The species' response to combined drying and shading was generally similar to its response to shading alone, suggesting that, at least over the short term, the indirect effects of climate change could be more severe than the direct effects. Thus, despite the species' slow growth rate and the short duration of the experiment, persistent direct and indirect effects were observed, both with potential longer-term consequences for A. selago populations. Climate change is, therefore, likely to impact negatively on this long-lived keystone species, with significant implications for the structure and functioning of fellfield systems.

AB The evolution of polyandry remains controversial. Various hypotheses that account for its evolution assume heritable variation in polyandry. We compared the frequency of female remating in 10 strains of the adzuki bean beetle, Callosobruchus chinensis, then made crosses between populations of high and low remating frequencies to investigate the mode of inheritance of polyandry. We found significant heritable variation in polyandry between the strains. Lower levels of polyandry were found in populations derived from long-term laboratory cultures than in those from recently established ones, suggesting that a selection pressure favoured monandry in the laboratory cultures. F, offspring from reciprocal crosses between strains with high and low frequencies of female remating had frequencies similar to that of the strain with a high remating frequency, suggesting that polyandry is inherited with dominance in C. chinensis, unlike any other species reported to date. This study indicates that polyandry can evolve in response to selection in C. chinensis.

AB The carnivorous pitcher plant Sarracenia purpurea receives nutrients from both captured prey and atmospheric deposition, making it a good subject for the study of ecological stoichiometry and nutrient limitation. We added prey in a manipulative field experiment and measured nutrient accumulation in pitcher-plant tissue and pitcher liquid, as well as changes in plant morphology, growth, and photosynthetic rate. Prey addition had no effect on traditional measures of nutrient limitation (leaf morphology, growth, or photosynthetic rate). However, stoichiometric measures of nutrient limitation were affected, as the concentration of both N and P in the leaf tissue increased with the addition of prey. Pitcher fluid pH and nitrate concentration did not vary among treatments, although dissolved oxygen levels decreased and ammonia levels increased with prey addition. Ratios of N:P, N:K, and K:P in pitcher-plant tissues suggest that prey additions shifted these carnivorous plants from P limitation under ambient conditions to N limitation with the addition of prey.

AB Covarion models of molecular evolution allow the rate of evolution of a site to vary through time. There are few simple and effective tests for covarion evolution, and consequently, little is known about the presence of covarion processes in molecular evolution. We describe two new tests for covarion evolution and demonstrate with simulations that they perform well under a wide range of conditions. A survey of covarion evolution in sequenced plastid genomes found evidence of covarion drift in at least 26 out of 57 genes. Covarion evolution is most evident in first and second codon positions of the plastid genes, and there is no evidence of covarion evolution in third codon positions. Therefore, the significant covarion tests are likely due to changes in the selective constraints of amino acids. The frequency of covarion evolution within the plastid genome suggests that covarion processes of evolution were important in generating the observed patterns of sequence variation among plastid genomes.

AB The present study was performed to investigate the adjustment of the constituents of the light and dark reactions of photosynthesis to the natural growth irradiance in the leaves of an overstorey species, Betula pendula Roth, a subcanopy species Tilia cordata P. Mill., and a herb Solidago virgaurea L. growing in a natural plant community in Jarvselja, Estonia. Shoots were collected from the site and properties of individual leaves were measured in a laboratory, by applying a routine of kinetic gas exchange and optical measurements that revealed photosystem II (PSII), photosystem I (PSI), and cytochrome b(6)f densities per leaf area and the distribution of excitation (or chlorophyll, Chl) between the two photosystems. In parallel, N, Chl and ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase (Rubisco) content was measured from the same leaves. The amount of N in photosynthetic proteins was calculated from the measured contents of the components of the photosynthetic machinery. Non-photosynthetic N was found as the residual of the budget. Growth in shade resulted in the decrease of leaf dry mass to a half of the DW in sun leaves in each species, but the total variation, from the top to the bottom of the canopy, was larger. Through the whole cross-section of the canopy, leaf dry weight (DW) and Rubisco content per area decreased by a factor of four, N content by a factor of three, but Chl content only by a factor of 1.7. PSII density decreased by a factor of 1.9, but PSI density by a factor of 3.2. The density of PSI adjusted to shade to a greater extent than the density of PSII. In shade, the distribution of N between the components of the photosynthetic machinery was shifted toward light-harvesting proteins at the expense of Rubisco. Non-photosynthetic N decreased the most substantially, from 54% in the sun leaves of B. pendula to 11% in the shade leaves of T. cordata. It is concluded that the redistribution of N toward light-harvesting Chl proteins in shade is not sufficient to keep the excitation rate of a PSII centre invariant. Contrary to PSII, the density of PSI - the photosystem that is in immediate contact with the carbon assimilation system - shade-adjusts almost proportionally with the latter, whereas its Chl antenna correspondingly increases. Even under N deficiency, a likely condition in the natural plant community, a substantial part of N is stored in non-photosynthetic proteins under abundant irradiation, but much less under limiting irradiation. At least in trees the general sequence of down-regulation due to shade adjustment is the following: (1) non-protein cell structures and non-photosynthetic proteins; (2) carbon assimilation proteins; (3) light reaction centre proteins, first PSI; and (4) chlorophyll-binding proteins.

AB The Canterbury Plains in the eastern South Island is one of the most modified regions of New Zealand with less than 2% of indigenous vegetation cover remaining. The critically endangered ground beetle Holcaspis brevicula Butcher, a local endemic known only from a small area in that region, is thought to be threatened by the loss and fragmentation of the formerly widespread forest and shrubland habitat. Previously, only the two type specimens, both male, were known to science. From 2000-2005, we conducted a survey for H. brevicula, using pitfall traps and active searching, in four of the largest remnants of the once extensive low forest and shrubland of kanuka, Kunzea ericoides, each covering less than 20 ha. In addition we conducted extensive trapping in an adjacent 7000 ha plantation forest of exotic Pinus radiata, in grassland and pasture areas, exotic shrubland, and in the nearest mountain beech (Nothofagus solandri var. cliffortioides) forest in the foothills of the Southern Alps. A total of 8658 carabids representing 47 species were collected over 57 494 trap-days, including five specimens of H. brevicula, all found in the pine plantation. A search of all major New Zealand collections for this species revealed three additional specimens, bringing the overall total of known specimens to ten, all of which were collected in this plantation forest. We propose that the exotic plantation forest inadvertently provides an important substitute habitat for this forest carabid, whereas the few small and fragmented native kanuka remnants appear to be insufficient to maintain populations of this species.

AB Understanding the evolution of polyandry (mating with multiple males) is a major issue in the study of animal breeding systems. We examined the adaptive significance of polyandry in Drosophila melanogaster, a species with well-documented costs of mating in which males generally cannot force copulations. We found no direct fitness advantages of polyandry. Females that mated with multiple males had no greater mean fitness and no different variance in fitness than females that mated repeatedly with the same male. Subcomponents of reproductive success, including fecundity, egg hatch rate, larval viability, and larval development time, also did not differ between polyandrous and monogamous females. Polyandry had no affect on progeny sex ratios, suggesting that polyandry does not function against costly sex-ratio distorters. We also found no evidence that polyandry functions to favor the paternity of males successful in precopulatory sexual selection. Experimentally controlled opportunities for precopulatory sexual selection had no effect on postcopulatory sperm precedence. Although these results were generally negative, they are supported with substantial statistical power and they help narrow the list of evolutionary explanations for polyandry in an important model species.

AB The Holoarctic termite genus Reticulitermes is widely distributed in Europe. A new Reticulitermes species, R. sp. nov, was recently found in France and Italy. Its phylogenetic position was investigated using a 743-bp fragment of mitochondrial 16S rRNA-ND1 genes and 382-bp of the nuclear ITS2 region. Phylogenies for these sequences were estimated by neighbor-joining, maximum-parsimony and maximum-likelihood analysis. The results strongly supported a relationship between R. sp. nov. and the termite species from the eastern Mediterranean area including Reticulitermes balkanensis from the Balkans, Reticulitermes lucifugus from Turkey and Reticulitermes clypeatus from Israel. The hypothesis of a relationship between R. sp. nov. and the Japanese Reticulitermes speratus was rejected by parametric bootstrap. The current distribution of R. sp. nov. could be linked to postglacial colonization routes between Balkan refuge and northern regions. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The role of competition in regulating reef fish populations has been controversial. Here, we test the effect of intraspecific competition on the spatial distribution and social organisation of Gobiodon histrio, an obligate coral-dwelling goby that inhabits the branching coral Acropora nasuta. At Lizard Island (Great Barrier Reef), social groups of G. histrio consisted of either a single individual or a breeding pair and occupied 98% of A. nasuta colonies, indicating that corals are a limiting resource. Furthermore, there was a positive relationship between fish size and coral size, with small, single G. histrio mostly occupying small corals (< 15 to 20 cm diameter) and larger paired fish occupying large corals (> 15 to 20 cm diameter). A manipulative experiment involving small and large corals demonstrated that this positive relationship between fish size and habitat size was due to size-based competition for large corals. Small and large G. histrio exhibited a similar preference for large corals (using large corals in approximately 80% of trials), but small fish were usually excluded from large corals in the presence of a larger fish. Small fish were more likely to use large corals in the presence of a single adult (38% of trials) than in the presence of an adult pair (8% of trials), suggesting that small fish may be able to enter a large coral following the loss of one individual in a breeding pair. The presence of a threshold coral size for the formation of breeding pairs means that an individual's ability to compete for large corals will influence its reproductive success.

AB The effects of supplementary ultraviolet-B (UV-B) radiation on the changes in synthesis and degradation of ribulose -1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) and light-harvesting chlorophyll a /b binding protein of PSII (LHCII) were examined, as well as mRNA levels for small and large subunits of Rubisco (rbcS and rbcL , respectively) and LHCII (cab ) with leaf age in UV-sensitive rice (Norin 1) and UV-resistant rice (Sasanishiki). Both Rubisco and LHCII were actively synthesized until the leaf had fully expanded, and then decreased with increasing leaf age. Synthesis of Rubisco, but not LHCII, was significantly suppressed by UV-B in Norin 1. The degradation of Rubisco was enhanced by UV-B around the time of leaf maturation in the two cultivars. The levels of rbcS and rbcL were reduced by UV-B at the early stages after leaf emergence in both cultivars. Cab transcripts were first present at high levels in the two cultivars, but drastically decreased due to UV-B treatment immediately after leaf emergence in Norin 1. It was shown that synthesis and degradation of Rubisco and LHCII greatly changed with leaf age: Rubisco synthesis was significantly suppressed by supplementary UV-B radiation at the transcription step during the early leaf stages. It was also suggested that the difference in UV-B sensitivity in Rubisco synthesis between the two rice cultivars might be due to specific suppression both transcriptionally and post-transcriptionally.

AB In situ photosynthetic nitrogen-use efficiency (PNUE, photosynthetic capacity per unit leaf nitrogen) was investigated in species that commonly distributed at different altitudes (600-3700 m above sea level) on Mount Kinabalu. Photosynthetic nitrogen-use efficiency was lower in species at higher altitudes, with a mean PNUE at 3700 m being one-third as large as that at 600 m. This difference in PNUE was larger than that explained by the biochemical response to lower air pressures only. Across altitudes a negative correlation between C-13 abundance (delta(13)C) and PNUE was found. Species at higher altitudes tended to have higher delta(13)C, suggesting that they had a lower conductance for CO2 diffusion from the air to chloroplasts. The lower conductance might be responsible for the lower PNUE in species at higher altitudes. Although leaf nitrogen content per unit area tended to be higher at higher altitudes, it did not seem to contribute to increasing photosynthetic rates. Thus, the idea that a higher nitrogen content at higher altitudes is a compensation for a lower PNUE was not supported. In contrast to the large difference in PNUE among altitudes, PNUE tended to converge within a narrow range among species growing at the same altitude.

AB Recent technical advances allow straightforward access to genetic information directly drawn from DNA. The present article highlights the suitability of high variation molecular genetic markers, such as microsatellites, for studies relevant to amphibian conservation. Molecular markers appear particularly useful for i) measuring local gene flow and migration, ii) assigning individuals to their most likely population of origin, iii) measuring effective population size through the between-generation comparison of allele frequencies, and iv) detecting past demographic bottlenecks through allele frequency distortions. We demonstrate the use of some newly developed analytical tools on newt (Triturus sp.) microsatellite data, discuss practical aspects of using microsatellites for amphibians, and outline potential future research directions.

AB The potential enhancement of root growth and nodulation in vegetable soybean (AGS190) was studied with application of Azospirillum brasilense (Sp7) and A. lipoferum (CCM3863) co-inoculated with two Bradyrhizobium japonicum strains (TAL 102 and UPMR48). Significant root growth stimulation and nodulation were observed in Azospirillum as well as during its co-inoculation with Bradyrhizobium. Nodule formation is linked with the initiation of new roots; nodules were almost absent even in Bradyrhizobium inoculated plant due to the absence of new roots development in clipped rooted seedlings. Total root length, root number, specific root length, root dry matter, root hair development and shoot dry matter were significantly increased by Azospirillum alone and its co-inoculum. Co-inoculated plants significantly influenced the number of nodules and its fresh weight. A. brasilense seemed to perform better in root growth and nodule development compared to A. lipoferum.

AB We illustrate the use of Faith's 'Phylogenetic Diversity' measure to compare the phylogeographic structure of two bird species with patterns of avian endemism across six mountains in Cameroon and Equatorial Guinea. The Mountain Greenbul and Cameroon Blue-headed Sunbird showed phylogeographic patterns that together defined three biogeographic regions: Bioko, Mt. Cameroon, and the northern mountains of Cameroon. In contrast, the distributions of endemic species were largely a function of geographical distance, with close mountains sharing more endemic species than distant mountains. Moreover, for both species, populations on Mt. Cameroon were distinctive with respect to the ecologically relevant character bill size. Our results, while preliminary, illustrate the utility of a comparative approach for identifying geographical regions that harbour evolutionarily distinct populations and caution against using only the distributional patterns of endemics to prioritize regions for conservation. Results show that patterns of endemism may not be concordant with patterns of phylogenetic diversity nor morphological variation in a character important in fitness. While incorporation of additional species from unrelated taxa will be necessary to draw definitive conclusions about evolutionarily distinct regions, our preliminary results suggest a conservation approach for the Afromontane region of the Gulf of Guinea that would: (i) emphasize protection of both Bioko and Mt. Cameroon, thereby maximizing preservation of within-species phylogenetic and morphologic diversity; (ii) emphasize protection within the northern mountains to further conserve intraspecific phylogenetic diversity and maximize protection of endemic species.

AB Rooting is frequently the most precarious step in any phylogenetic analysis. Outgroups can become useless for rooting if they are too distantly related to the ingroup. Specifically, little attention has been paid to scenarios where outgroups have evolved different nucleotide frequencies from the ingroup. We investigate one empirical example that arose seeking to determine the phylogenetic relationship between the sat tons and the willistoni groups of Drosophila (subgenus Sophophora). We have analyzed 2085 coding nucleotides from the xanthine dehydrogenase (Xdh) gene in 14 species, 6 from the saltans group and 8 from the willistoni group. We adopt a two-step strategy: (1) we investigate the phylogeny without outgroups, rooting the network by the midpoint method; (2) we reinvestigate the rooting of this phylogeny using predefined outgroups in both a parsimony- and a model-based maximum-likelihood framework. A satisfactory description of the substitution process along the Xdh region calls for six substitution types and substitution rate variation among codon positions. When the ingroup sequences are considered alone, the phylogeny obtained using this description corroborates the known relationships derived from anatomical criteria. Inclusion of the outgroups makes the root unstable, apparently because of differences between ingroups and outgroups in the substitution processes; these differences are better accounted for by a simplified model of evolution than by more complex, realistic descriptions of the substitution process.

AB Broccoli is resistant to Verticillium dahliae infection and does not express wilt symptoms. Incorporation of broccoli residues reduces soil populations of V. dahliae. The effects of broccoli residue were tested on the colonization of roots by V. dahliae, plant growth response, and disease incidence of both broccoli and cauliflower in soils with different levels of Ct dahliae inoculum and with or without fresh broccoli residue amendments. The three soils included a low-Verticillium soil, a high-Verticillium soil, and a broccoli-rotation soil (soil from a field after two broccoli crops) with an average of 13, 38, and below-detectable levels of micro-sclerotia per g of soil, respectively. Cauliflower planes in broccoli-amended high-Verticillium soil had significantly (P less than or equal to 0.05) lower wilt incidence and severity than did plants in unamended soil. An immunohistochemical staining assay utilizing a monoclonal antibody specific to V. dahliae was used to determine colonization of the root cortex. Despite the absence of wilt symptoms, broccoli roots were colonized by V. dahliae. In high-Verticillium soil, the broccoli residue amendment caused a marked reduction in colonization rate of V. dahliae per unit of inoculum on both cauliflower and broccoli roots. In addition to its detrimental effects on the viability of microsclerotia in soil, broccoli residue may also have an inhibitory effect on the root-colonizing potential of surviving microsclerotia.

AB Tiger quells, Dasyurus maculatus, are the largest carnivorous marsupials still extant on the mainland of Australia and occupy an important ecological niche as top predators and scavengers. Two allopatric subspecies are recognized, D.m. gracilis in north Queensland, and D.m. maculatus in the southeast of the mainland and Tasmania. D.m. gracilis is considered endangered while D.m. maculatus is listed as vulnerable to extinction; both subspecies are still in decline. Phylogeographical subdivision was examined to determine evolutionarily significant units (ESUs) and management units (MUs) among populations of tiger quells to assist in the conservation of these taxa. Ninety-three tiger quells from nine representative populations were sampled from throughout the species range. Six nuclear microsatellite loci and the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region (471 bp) were used to examine ESUs and MUs in this species. We demonstrated that Tasmanian tiger quells are reciprocally monophyletic to those from the mainland using mtDNA analysis, but D.m. gracilis was not monophyletic with respect to mainland D.m. maculatus. Analysis of microsatellite loci also revealed significant differences between the Tasmanian and mainland tiger quells, and between D.m. gracilis and mainland D.m. maculatus. These results indicate that Tasmanian and mainland tiger quells form two distinct evolutionary units but that D.m. gracilis and mainland D.m. maculatus are different MUs within the same ESU. The two marker types used in this study revealed different male and female dispersal patterns and indicate that the most appropriate units for short-term management are local populations. A revised classification and management plan are needed for tiger quells, particularly in relation to conservation of the Tasmanian and Queensland populations.

AB Relationships among the 18-19 species of spinetaiIs of the genus Cranioleuca are difficult to establish. Attempts based on traditional taxonomic characters have failed because of a high degree of homoplasy. Most morphological characters vary independently, producing leap-frog patterns of variation along the Eastern Brazilian Andean track, and behavior and vocalizations vary little. We use mtDNA sequence data from the cyt b and ND2 genes in an attempt to clarify relationships within the genus. We show (i) that Cranioleuca represents a recent burst of speciation and (ii) that a set of species thought by Maijer and Fjelds (a) over circle (1997) to form a natural group is in fact a paraphyletic assemblage which also includes humid forest species with different pigmentations and vocalizations. However, synapomorphic variation in the sequences is not sufficient to unambiguously resolve the relationships within the genus. Several species (C. baroni, C. antisiensis, C. pyrrhophia, C. albiceps) show more than one haplotype, without any obvious correlation between genetic and geographic or morphological variation, and the different species do not always show reciprocal monophyly in haplotype diversity. Nevertheless, low genetic differentiation characterizes not only allopatric taxa but also some forms which are essentially sympatric, supporting species rank for the former. Our data suggest a recent diversification and proliferation possibly linked to Pleistocene climatic variation and its consequent vegetational shifts, at least in the Andean species.

AB A theoretical analysis of the concept of recruitment limitation leads to the conclusion that most populations should be regarded as jointly limited by recruitment and interactions between individuals after recruitment. The open nature of local marine systems does not permit avoidance of density-dependent interactions; it simply may make them more difficult to detect. Local populations consisting of settled organisms may not experience density-dependent interactions under some circumstances, but the entire species population consisting of the collection of local populations and their planktonic larvae must have density-dependent dynamics. Any local population of settled individuals can escape density dependence if sufficient density dependence occurs among planktonic larvae or within other local populations. Common conceptions of density dependence are too narrow leading too often to the conclusion that it is absent from a system. It is equally wrong to expect that density-dependent interactions after settlement determine local population densities independently of recruitment. Special circumstances allowing density dependence to act strongly and quickly are needed before density dependence can neutralize the effects of recruitment. Recruitment limitation and density-dependent interactions therefore should not be regarded as alternatives but as jointly acting to determine the densities of marine benthic populations. Moreover, the interaction between fluctuating recruitment and density dependence is potentially the most interesting feature of recruitment limitation. For example, this interaction may be an important diversity-maintaining mechanism for marine systems.

AB We describe sequence variation in the mitochondrial control region and its nuclear homolog in three species and seven subspecies of guillemots (Cepphus spp.). Nuclear homologs of the 5' end of the control region were found in all individuals. Nuclear sequences were similar to 50% divergent from their mitochondrial counterparts and formed a distinct phylogenetic clade; the mitochondrial-nuclear introgression event must have predated the radiation of Cepphus. As in other vertebrates, the guillemot control region has a relatively conserved central block flanked by hypervariable 5' and 3' ends. Mean pairwise interspecific divergence values among control regions were lower than those in other birds. All individuals were heteroplasmic for the number of simple tandem nucleotide repeats (A(n)C) at the 3' end of the control region. Phylogenetic analyses suggest that black guillemots are basal to pigeon and spectacled guillemots, but evolutionary relationships among subspecies remain unresolved, possibly due to incomplete lineage sorting. Describing molecular variation in nuclear homologs of mitochondrial genes is of general interest in phylogenetics because, if undetected, the homologs may confound interpretations of mitochondrial phylogenies.

AB Lack of evidence that sponge aquaculture can produce sustainable supply of target metabolite for industrial or pharmaceutical use is constraining commercial development. Experiments to determine aquaculture feasibility examined the influence of environmental factors and explant characteristics on the growth and survivorship of three morphologically distinct sponge species - Psammocinia hawere, a massive cup-shape fibrous sponge, Raspailia agminata, a thickly encrusting siliceous sponge and Raspailia topsenti, a branching digitate siliceous sponge. A variety of explant types were cultured at different exposures, depths and seasons. P-hawere explants transplanted to deeper water in winter demonstrated highest growth and survivorship. This was attributed to a relatively lower intensity of UV radiation and cooler water temperatures which promoted fast pinacoderm healing. Growth and survivorship increased with increasing explant size and with proportion of intact pinacoderm. R-agiminata explants demonstrated the highest growth rates, perhaps a function of the encrusting and flexible morphology. Highest growth and survivorship were obtained in sheltered locations. Within each species, ratio of body size to wound size and overall size of the wounds inflicted, would greatly influence survival, but with respect to temperate rocky reef sponges, this study suggests that encrusting and amorphous sponges have the greatest potential for success in aquaculture.

AB We examined mitochondrial control-region haplotype diversity and allelic frequency distributions for three polymorphic microsatellite loci in 541 coastal Oncorhynchus mykiss collected from six habitats associated with different levels of human activity and ocean access in southern California. Extensive urbanization, climatic unpredictability, and the accelerated rate of decline in anadromous fish suggested a probable loss of genetic diversity in this area due to habitat fragmentation, geographic isolation, and population bottlenecks. Unexpectedly high levels of genetic diversity were found in southern California populations of O. mykiss. Haplotype diversity (H-S) was highest in anadromous fish (H-S = 0.74) and lowest in the Whale Rock Hatchery trout (H-S = 0.32). The proportion of variation attributable to population differentiation among habitat groups (G(ST)) was 10%. Haplotype frequencies showed a close relationship between anadromous steelhead and resident rainbow trout from closed habitats (D-ST = 0.03). Combined microsatellite allelic diversity (at loci Omy77, Omy207, and Ssa289) was highest in rainbow trout from closed habitats (88%), and lowest in Whale Rock Hatchery fish (29%). Greatest microsatellite distance (delta mu = 17.1) was between anadromous steelhead and reservoir rainbow trout, and closest identity (delta mu = 1.8) was among rainbow trout from closed habitats, hatchery rainbow trout, and reservoir rainbow trout. Analysis of genetic distance measures for both molecular markers showed that considerations of life history patterns and freshwater habitats that retain ocean access remain important factors in the preservation of the unique genetic diversity found in southern California coastal O. mykiss.

AB 1. Habitat partitioning has been extensively studied in terrestrial plant communities. By comparison, few studies have examined habitat partitioning in riverine macrophyte communities. Riverine environments are often highly heterogeneous with respect to current speed, depth, bottom sediment fertility and other biologically important properties. Thus, the potential for habitat partitioning in riverine macrophyte communities is great.
   2. The objective of this study was to investigate how, or if, macrophyte species are differentially distributed with respect to abiotic gradients in a large river in central British Columbia, Canada.
   3. A survey of macrophyte biomass and associated measures of current speed, depth and sediment texture showed that coexistence occurred both with and without habitat partitioning.
   4. Coexistence in the absence of habitat partitioning was depicted by Potamogeton gramineus, Potamogeton berchtoldii, Myriophyllum exalbescens, Callitriche hermaphroditica and Potamogeton pectinatus such that they had a minimum and average niche overlap (NO) of 65% and 84%, respectively, for all measured abiotic variables. Similarly, the spatial niche of E. canadensis was close to that of Ceratophyllum demersum and M. exalbescens.
   5. While several taxa seemed to occupy the same spatial niche, some taxa were distinguished from one another in terms of the types of microhabitats they utilized. Mosses, for example, were often the only occupants of sites having current speeds greater than 0.6 m s(-1) and substrates of bare rock. Ranunculus aquatilis was most abundant at sites having current speeds between 0.4 and 0.6 m s(-1) whereas most other taxa were restricted to slower waters. Habitat partitioning across depth contours, which occurred between several taxa, was most evident between P. pectinatus and C. demersum (NO=17%), C. hermaphroditica and C. demersum (NO=3%), C. demersum and P. richardsonii (NO=19%) and C. hermaphroditica and E. canadensis (NO=29%).

AB Maize (Zea maps L.) in the early season in no-till (NT), compared with conventional tillage (CT), has reduced dry matter due to cooler temperatures near the seed, in spite of increased plant P absorption caused by more effective mycorrhizae in the less-disturbed soil. We grew maize under NT and CT in a soil with 1.6 mg kg(-1) NaHCO3--extractable P, adding 0, 25, 50, or 100 kg P ha(-1). A rotary cultivator (ROTO) soil-disturbance treatment gave plots more severe disturbance than CT, and a no-till hand-plant (NTHP) treatment gave plots with minimal soil disturbance. Early season P uptake and mycorrhizal colonization Here stimulated in the NT and NTHP treatments. The reverse was true for shoot dry mass. Early season responses to tillage treatments were the same at each of the fertilizer rates. Yields increased with increasing fertilization. At all rates of P, yields with the CT and ROTO treatments were similar to each other, as were yields with the NT and NTHP treatments. At low soil-P fertility, NT and CT gave similar yields. However, at and above 50 kg P ha(-1), yields in CT exceeded those in NT by 1000 kg ha(-1). We expect that under P-limiting conditions, NT could give increases in yield over CT, or similar yields could be achieved in NT and CT but at lower soil-P availability in NT, but only if the early season growth depression in NT can be overcome.

AB Partitioning of nitrogen among species was determined in a stand of a tall herbaceous community. Total amount of nitrogen in the aboveground biomass was 261 mmol Nm(-2), of which 92% was in three dominant species (Phragmites, Calamagrostis and Carer) and the rest was in the other eight subordinate species. Higher nitrogen concentrations per unit leaf area (n(L)) with increasing photosynthetically active photon flux density (PPFD) were observed in all species except for three short species. The changes in n(L) within species were mainly explained by the different nitrogen concentrations per unit leaf mass, while the differences in n(L), between species were explained by the different SLM (leaf mass per unit leaf area). Photon absorption per unit leaf nitrogen (Phi(N)) was determined for each species. If photosynthetic activity was proportional to photon absorption, Phi(N) Should indicate in situ PNUE (photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency). High Phi(N) of Calamagrostis (dominant) resulted from high photon absorption per unit leaf area (Phi(area)), whereas high Phi(N) of Scutellaria (subordinate) resulted from low n(L) although its Phi(area) was low. Species with cylinder-like ''leaves'' (Juncus and Equisetum) had low Phi(N), which resulted from their high n(L). Light-saturated CO2 exchange rates per unit leaf area (CER) and per unit leaf nitrogen (potential PNUE) were determined in seven species. Species with high CER and high n(L) (Phragmites, Carex and Juncus) had low potential PNUE, while species with low CER and low N-L showed high potential PNUE. NUE (ratio of dry mass production to nitrogen uptake) was approximated as a reciprocal of plant nitrogen concentration. In most species, three measures of nitrogen use efficiency (NUE, Phi(N) and potential PNUE) showed strong conformity. Nitrogen use efficiency was high in Calamagrostis and Scutellaria, intermediate in Phragmites and relatively low in Carex. Nitrogen use efficiency of subordinate species was as high as or even higher than that of dominant species, which suggests that growth is co-limited by light and nitrogen in the subordinate species.

ID RELATIVE GROWTH
AB Growth and morphological characteristics of four weed and two crop species were analyzed to determine how small-seeded weeds can compete with large-seeded crops despite the initial size disadvantage. Small-seeded weeds had higher relative growth rates because of increased percentages of biomass devoted to leaves. This morphological scheme was achieved primarily through a reduction in the percentage of biomass devoted to roots. Yet, small-seeded weeds were able to develop larger mean plant root lengths as a result of having both roots of smaller diameter and higher rates of root length increase.

AB (1) High-density populations of Ocimum basilicum L. were grown in sand culture at three nutrient levels to investigate patterns of self-thinning in stands grown over a range of nutrient supply. (2) Populations of Ocimum at each of three nutrient levels showed self-thinning with different biomass-density relationships (thinning lines) for each level. The lines for the stands at the two lower nutrient levels lay below that followed by the stands grown at the high level. Thus competition was more intense in the stands grown at low nutrient levels, when compared at a common plant mass. However, because thinning proceeded fastest in the stands grown at high nutrient supply, competition at a common time was most intense in these stands. (3) It is proposed that the mechanism underlying intensified competition (irrespective of rate of development) is the extent of overlap of resource depletion zones to achieve given plant mass. If this overlap increases at lower resource levels to achieve a given plant mass, competition will intensify at the lower resource levels. However, the rate at which overlap develops at each resource level will determine the intensity of competition when stands are compared in time. (4) Plants of Ocimum from stands grown at lower nutrient levels tended to have less radial extension of the canopy for a given height, and to be shorter and have less radial extension for a given shoot weight. Thus they packed their shoot weight into a smaller canopy volume plant-1 than plants at high nutrient levels. If canopy packing had determined the relative positions of thinning lines, populations grown at low nutrient levels would have followed higher thinning lines than those at high levels. (5) Biomass packing, when measured at the population level, showed the reverse trend, i.e. it was lower in the stands at low nutrient levels. This occurred because of the wider spacing between plants in these stands than in the high-resource stands at a given biomass level. Canopy interactions between plants grown at low nutrient levels were less than in plants grown at high nutrient levels. Thus the major determinant of plant spacing in the stands at low nutrient levels was below rather than above ground. (6) Plants competing for nutrients can increase uptake by increasing the absorbing power of the root, and/or by growing more root. Root and root hair measurements failed to detect any morphological evidence of increased absorbing power in the plants grown at low nutrient levels. (7) Plants at the two lower nutrient levels grew relatively more root (weight and length than those at the high nutrient level. Just under half of this root growth occurred in the top 16% of the soil volume. Root densities achieved were so high that conditions for mutual overlap of depletion zones for mobile nutrients were present. This is taken as evidence that increased overlap of nutrient uptake zones occurred at lower nutrient levels in order for plants to achieve a given mass.

AB Seedlings of Acacia auriculiformis A. Cunn. ex. Benth., Albizia lebbeck (L.) Benth., Gliricidia sepium (Jac.) Walp and Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) dc Wit. were inoculated with an ectomycorrhizal (Boletus suillus (L. ex. Fr.) or indigenous vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal (VAM) fungi in a low P soil. The plants were subjected to unstressed (well-watered) and drought-stressed (water-stressed) conditions. In Gliricidia and Leucaena, both mycorrhizal inoculations stimulated greater plant growth, P and N uptake compared to their non-mycorrhizal (NM) plants under both watering regimes. However, in Acacia and Albizia, these parameters were only stimulated by either ectomycorrhiza (Acacia) or VA mycorrhiza (Albizia). Growth reduction occurred as a result of inoculation with the other type of mycorrhiza. This was attributed to competition for carbon between Acacia and VA mycorrhizas and parasitic association between Albizia and ectomycorrhiza.
   Drought-stressed mycorrhizal and NM Leucaena, and drought-stressed mycorrhizal Acacia tolerated lower xylem pressure potentials and larger water losses than the drought-stressed mycorrhizal and NM Albizia and Gliricidia. These latter plants avoided drought by maintaining higher xylem pressure potentials and leaf relative water content (RWC). All the four leguminous plants were mycorrhizal dependent. The higher the mycorrhizal dependency (MD), the lower the drought tolerance expressed in terms of drought response index (DRI). The DRI may be a useful determinant of MD, as they are inversely related.

AB Dispersion, distribution, development and feeding incidence of larvae of the naked goby, Gobiosoma bosci (Lacepede), were examined for linkages between larval behavior while near the reef surface and later patterns of settlement and recruitment. Field sampling and experiments were conducted during the summers of 1988 and 1989 in the Flag Pond oyster reef along the western shore of the Chesapeake Bay near Camp Conoy, Maryland, USA. Results indicated that prior to settlement most demersal larvae aggregate in shoals and exhibit distinct microhabitat preferences on the reef. In a field experiment, larvae settled both during the day and at night. Dispersion at settlement was aggregated, suggesting that demersal shoaling influences settlement patterns in this species. The distribution of demersal larvae also indicated that larval swimming behavior is sufficiently strong to permit active control of position on reefs. Large demersal larvae settled rapidly when brought to the laboratory, but small larvae in demersal shoals appeared to require additional growth and morphological development prior to settlement. Development of the pelvic fins, used by juveniles and adults for perching on the substrate, may be a good indicator of competence to settle in this species. The adaptive significance of demersal shoaling by small larvae of the naked goby, and the fate of these larvae, remains perplexing because the low feeding rates found for larvae shoaling near the reef surface should slow or prevent the growth and development required prior to settlement. Observations made by other authors indicate that demersal shoaling and the use of water directly overlying reefs may be common behaviors of temperate and tropical reef fishes.

AB The filamentous fungal family Aspergillaceae contains >1,000 known species, mostly in the genera Aspergillus and Penicillium. Several species are used in the food, biotechnology, and drug industries (e.g., Aspergillus oryzae and Penicillium camemberti), while others are dangerous human and plant pathogens (e.g., Aspergitllus fumigatus and Penicillium digitatum). To infer a robust phylogeny and pinpoint poorly resolved branches and their likely underlying contributors, we used 81 genomes spanning the diversity of Aspergillus and Penicillium to construct a 1,668-gene data matrix. Phylogenies of the nucleotide and amino acid versions of this full data matrix as well as of several additional data matrices were generated using three different maximum likelihood schemes (i.e., gene-partitioned, unpartitioned, and coalescence) and using both site-homogenous and site-heterogeneous models (total of 64 species-level phylogenies). Examination of the topological agreement among these phylogenies and measures of internode certainty identified 11/78 (14.1%) bipartitions that were incongruent and pinpointed the likely underlying contributing factors, which included incomplete lineage sorting, hidden paralogy, hybridization or introgression, and reconstruction artifacts associated with poor taxon sampling. Relaxed molecular clock analyses suggest that Aspergillaceae likely originated in the lower Cretaceous and that the Aspergillus and Penicillium genera originated in the upper Cretaceous. Our results shed light on the ongoing debate on Aspergillus systematics and taxonomy and provide a robust evolutionary and temporal framework for comparative genomic analyses in Aspergillaceae. More broadly, our approach provides a general template for phylogenomic identification of resolved and contentious branches in densely genome-sequenced lineages across the tree of life.
   IMPORTANCE Understanding the evolution of traits across technologically and medically significant fungi requires a robust phylogeny. Even though species in the Aspergillus and Penicillium genera (family Aspergillaceae, class Eurotiomycetes) are some of the most significant technologically and medically relevant fungi, we still lack a genome-scale phylogeny of the lineage or knowledge of the parts of the phylogeny that exhibit conflict among analyses. Here, we used a phylogenomic approach to infer evolutionary relationships among 81 genomes that span the diversity of Aspergillus and Penicillium species, to identify conflicts in the phylogeny, and to determine the likely underlying factors of the observed conflicts. Using a data matrix comprised of 1,668 genes, we found that while most branches of the phylogeny of the Aspergillaceae are robustly supported and recovered irrespective of method of analysis, a few exhibit various degrees of conflict among our analyses. Further examination of the observed conflict revealed that it largely stems from incomplete lineage sorting and hybridization or introgression. Our analyses provide a robust and comprehensive evolutionary genomic roadmap for this important lineage, which will facilitate the examination of the diverse technologically and medically relevant traits of these fungi in an evolutionary context.

AB Quaternary (last 2.6 million years) botany involves studying plant megafossils (e.g. tree stumps), macrofossils (e.g. seeds, leaves), and microfossils (e.g. pollen, spores) preserved in peat bogs and lake sediments. Although megafossils and macrofossils have been studied since the late eighteenth century, Quaternary botany today is largely dominated by pollen analysis.
   Quaternary pollen analysis is just over 100 years old. It started primarily as a geological tool for correlation, relative dating, and climate reconstruction. In 1950 a major advance occurred with the publication by Knut Faegri and Johs Iversen of their Text-book of Modern Pollen Analysis which provided the foundations for pollen analysis as a botanical and ecological tool for studying past dynamics of biota and biotic systems. The development of radiocarbon dating in the 1950s freed pollen analysis from being a tool for relative dating. As a result of these developments, pollen analysis became a valuable implement in long-term ecology and biogeography.
   Selected contributions that Quaternary botany has made to ecology and biogeography since 1950 are reviewed. They fall into four general parts: (1) ecological aspects of interglacial and glacial stages such as location and nature of glacial-stage tree refugia and long-term soil development in glaciated and unglaciated areas; (2) biotic responses to Quaternary environmental change (spreading, extinction, persistence, adaptation); (3) ecological topics such as potential niches, the nature of vegetation, and tree and forest dynamics; and (4) its application to ecological topics such as human impact in tropical systems, conservation in a changing world, island palaeoecology, plant-animal interactions, and biodiversity patterns in time.
   The future of Quaternary botany is briefly discussed and 10 suggestions are presented to help strengthen it and its links with ecology and biogeography. Quaternary botany has much to contribute to ecology and biogeography when used in conjunction with new approaches such as ancient-DNA, molecular biomarkers, and multi-proxy palaeoecology.

AB Correlations among plant traits often reflect important trade-offs or allometric relationships in biological functions like carbon gain, support, water uptake, and reproduction that are associated with different plant organs. Whether trait correlations can be aggregated to "spectra" or "leading dimensions," whether these dimensions are consistent across plant organs, spatial scale, and growth forms are still open questions. To illustrate the current state of knowledge, we constructed a network of published trait correlations associated with the "leaf economics spectrum," "biomass allocation dimension," "seed dimension," and carbon and nitrogen concentrations. This literature-based network was compared to a network based on a dataset of 23 traits from 2,530 individuals of 126 plant species from 381 plots in Northwest Europe. The observed network comprised more significant correlations than the literature-based network. Network centrality measures showed that size traits such as the mass of leaf, stem, below-ground, and reproductive tissues and plant height were the most central traits in the network, confirming the importance of allometric relationships in herbaceous plants. Stem mass and stem-specific length were "hub" traits correlated with most traits. Environmental selection of hub traits may affect the whole phenotype. In contrast to the literature-based network, SLA and leaf N were of minor importance. Based on cluster analysis and subsequent PCAs of the resulting trait clusters, we found a "size" module, a "seed" module, two modules representing C and N concentrations in plant organs, and a "partitioning" module representing organ mass fractions. A module representing the plant economics spectrum did not emerge. Synthesis. Although we found support for several trait dimensions, the observed trait network deviated significantly from current knowledge, suggesting that previous studies have overlooked trait coordination at the whole-plant level. Furthermore, network analysis suggests that stem traits have a stronger regulatory role in herbaceous plants than leaf traits.

AB Increased global agricultural output since the 1990s has been largely driven by innovations that raised the efficiency of use of labour, land, capital and other inputs-referred to as total factor productivity (TFP) growth. Yet debates over the future of farming still weigh heavily on models of agricultural land use and socioecological trade-offs along traditional (partial factor productivity) growth paths of 'intensification' or 'extensification'. Overlooking the role of TFP in the evolution of global agriculture not only obscures the changing drivers of productivity growth but also misses vital linkages with agricultural sustainability and farming system resilience. We describe two pathways for growth-technology-based and ecosystem-based-and link these in a heuristic framework that emphasizes sustainability and resilience outcomes in farming systems. Interdisciplinary research is urgently needed to empirically examine the dynamic interplay of TFP growth, farming system sustainability and resilience. Such insights will help to transform TFP growth as metric into actionable efforts on farms and beyond.

AB In seasonally dry environments, critical zone drainage provides base flow that sustains river ecosystems. The extent of wetted channels and magnitude of base flow throughout the network, however, are rarely documented, and no general theory currently exists enabling the prediction of these key ecosystem properties. We conducted channel surveys in early and late summers of 2012, 2014, and 2015 in four headwater drainage networks (2.8-17.0 km(2), in the Franciscan Formation of the Eel River (Northern California)), two of which are underlain by the Coastal Belt (argillite and inter-bedded sandstone) and two of which are underlain by the Central Belt (sheared argillaceous-matrix, meta-sedimentary melange). In all networks, stationary springs controlled the extent of flow. Though surveyed during a period of multiyear drought, the two adjacent Coastal Belt networks remained flowing throughout late-summer months, sustained by drainage from groundwater stored in thick weathered bedrock above fresh, impermeable bedrock. Flow magnitudes, however, decreased and surface flows became increasingly discontinuous, largely due to infiltration into thick gravel deposits on the channel bed. Only 23 km away, in the Central Belt melange, channel flow ceased early in the summer because the thin critical zone (typically <3 m) stored little water. All late-summer flowing water initiated from deep-rooted sandstone blocks and terminated a short distance downslope. Our findings suggest that lithology and critical zone development exert primary controls on wetted channel extent. Given similar annual precipitation, nearby watersheds can have dramatically different summer wetted channel networks that result in fundamentally different aquatic ecosystems.

AB Soil aggregates provide microhabitats for nematodes and microorganisms, but how nematodes and microbial community interactively drive the dynamics of soil organic carbon (SOC) pool remains unclear. Here, we examined the relationships between bacterivorous nematodes, microbial community, and the sizes and turnover rates of three SOC pools in a red soil under four fertilization regimes. The abundance and community composition of nematode and bacterial communities were examined within aggregate fractions, including large macroaggregates (LMA), small macroaggregates (SMA), and microaggregates (MA). The sizes of SOC pools in soil aggregates increased with decreasing aggregate size, while the turnover rates of SOC pools followed the opposite trend. The ratios of bacteria to fungi (B/F) and Gram-positive to Gram-negative bacteria (GP/GN) were higher in the MA fraction than in the SMA and LMA fractions. The assemblages of bacterivorous nematodes in the LMA fraction were significantly different from those in the MA and SMA fractions, primarily because of the higher abundance of the dominant genus Protorhabditis. Results of structural equation modelling indicated that the ratios of B/F and GP/GN showed stronger positive correlations with the sizes and turnover rates of SOC pools in the MA fraction compared with the LMA fraction. Conversely, bacterivores exhibited indirect relationships with the sizes and turnover rates of SOC pools through the B/F ratio in the SMA and LMA fractions. Taken together, these results highlight the functional role of nematodes and microbial community in controlling SOC pool dynamics at the aggregate scale.

AB Species' differences in the stringency of stomatal control of plant water potential represent a continuum of isohydric to anisohydric behaviours. However, little is known about how quasi-steady-state stomatal regulation of water potential may relate to dynamic behaviour of stomata and photosynthetic gas exchange in species operating at different positions along this continuum. Here, we evaluated kinetics of light-induced stomatal opening, activation of photosynthesis and features of quasi-steady-state photosynthetic gas exchange in 10 woody species selected to represent different degrees of anisohydry. Based on a previously developed proxy for the degree of anisohydry, species' leaf water potentials at turgor loss, we found consistent trends in photosynthetic gas exchange traits across a spectrum of isohydry to anisohydry. More anisohydric species had faster kinetics of stomatal opening and activation of photosynthesis, and these kinetics were closely coordinated within species. Quasi-steady-state stomatal conductance and measures of photosynthetic capacity and performance were also greater in more anisohydric species. Intrinsic water-use efficiency estimated from leaf gas exchange and stable carbon isotope ratios was lowest in the most anisohydric species. In comparisons between gas exchange traits, species rankings were highly consistent, leading to species-independent scaling relationships over the range of isohydry to anisohydry observed.

AB Aim: To explore the scale dependence of relationships between novel measures of geodiversity and species richness of both native and alien vascular plants.
   Location: Great Britain.
   Time period: Data collected 1995-2015.
   Major taxa: Vascular plants.
   Methods: We calculated the species richness of terrestrial native and alien vascular plants (6,932 species in total) across the island of Great Britain at grain sizes of 1 km(2) (n = 219,964) and 100 km(2) (n = 2,121) and regional extents of 25-250 km diameter, centred around each 100-km(2) cell. We compiled geodiversity data on landforms, soils, hydrological and geological features using existing national datasets, and used a newly developed geomorphometric method to extract landform coverage data (e.g., hollows, ridges, valleys, peaks). We used these as predictors of species richness alongside climate, commonly used topographic metrics, land-cover variety and human population. We analysed species richness across scales using boosted regression tree (BRT) modelling and compared models with and without geodiversity data.
   Results: Geodiversity significantly improved models over and above the widely used topographic metrics, particularly at smaller extents and the finer grain size, and slightly more so for native species richness. For each increase in extent, the contribution of climatic variables increased and that of geodiversity decreased. Of the geodiversity variables, automatically extracted landform data added the most explanatory power, but hydrology (rivers, lakes) and materials (soil, superficial deposits, geology) were also important.
   Main conclusions: Geodiversity improves our understanding of, and our ability to model, the relationship between species richness and abiotic heterogeneity at multiple spatial scales by allowing us to get closer to the real-world physical processes that affect patterns of life. The greatest benefit comes from measuring the constituent parts of geodiversity separately rather than one combined variable (as in most of the few studies to date). Automatically extracted landform data, the use of which is novel in ecology and biogeography, proved particularly valuable in our study.

AB 1. Overgrazing has resulted in widespread decline in biodiversity and ecosystem functioning in grasslands world-wide in recent decades. However, few studies have examined the patterns and thresholds of grazing-induced changes in community structure and ecosystem functioning along a grazing gradient and based on species-level responses and plant functional traits.
   2. To identify the thresholds of grazing intensity (GI) at both species and community levels, we conducted a grazing manipulation experiment with seven levels of GI (0-9 sheep ha(-1)) and two topographies (flat vs. slope) in a typical steppe. Four plant functional traits were measured, including specific leaf area (SLA), plant height, leaf nitrogen content (LNC) and stem: leaf ratio.
   3. The threshold of GI that significantly altered community composition was at 3.75 sheep ha(-1) for the flat system and 3.0 sheep ha(-1) for the slope system. For both flat and slope systems, the threshold GI for changes in primary productivity was at 3.0 sheep ha(-1), beyond which the productivity decreased substantially.
   4. At the species level, the abundances of common species, most of which are perennial grasses, declined at moderate grazing intensities (3.0-4.5 sheep ha(-1)). The abundances of most rare species, which are perennial forbs, declined at low grazing intensities (1.5-3 .0 sheep ha(-1)). SLA and LNC are good predictors of species-level responses to grazing. Low SLA and high LNC species are negatively affected by high GI, while high SLA and low LNC species are little affected by grazing. The negative effect of GI on species' abundance was greater in the slope system than in the flat system.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Our results indicate that the structural and functioning thresholds of grazing intensity depend on plant traits and species composition, which is mediated by topographic location. These findings, integrating plant functional traits and threshold approaches, have important implications for determining sustainable grazing intensity in grassland management and biodiversity conservation in semi-arid regions.

AB Global climate change is likely to constrain low latitude range edges across many taxa and habitats. Such is the case for NE Atlantic marine macroalgal forests, important ecosystems whose main structuring species is the annual kelp Saccorhiza polyschides. We coupled ecological niche modelling with simulations of potential dispersal and delayed development stages to infer the major forces shaping range edges and to predict their dynamics. Models indicated that the southern limit is set by high winter temperatures above the physiological tolerance of overwintering microscopic stages and reduced upwelling during recruitment. The best range predictions were achieved assuming low spatial dispersal (5 km) and delayed stages up to two years (temporal dispersal). Reconstructing distributions through time indicated losses of similar to 30% from 1986 to 2014, restricting S. polyschides to upwelling regions at the southern edge. Future predictions further restrict populations to a unique refugium in northwestern Iberia. Losses were dependent on the emissions scenario, with the most drastic one shifting similar to 38% of the current distribution by 2100. Such distributional changes might not be rescued by dispersal in space or time (as shown for the recent past) and are expected to drive major biodiversity loss and changes in ecosystem functioning.

AB The assessment of the genetic structuring of biodiversity is crucial for management and conservation. For species with large effective population sizes a low number of markers may fail to identify population structure. A solution of this shortcoming can be high-throughput sequencing that allows genotyping thousands of markers on a genome-wide approach while facilitating the detection of genetic structuring shaped by selection. We used Genotyping-by-Sequencing (GBS) on 176 individuals of the endemic East Atlantic peacock wrasse (Symphodus tinca), from 6 locations in the Adriatic and Ionian seas. We obtained a total of 4,155 polymorphic SNPs and we observed two strong barriers to gene flow. The first one differentiated Tremiti Islands, in the northwest, from all the other locations while the second one separated east and south-west localities. Outlier SNPs potentially under positive selection and neutral SNPs both showed similar patterns of structuring, although finer scale differentiation was unveiled with outlier loci. Our results reflect the complexity of population genetic structure and demonstrate that both habitat fragmentation and positive selection are on play. This complexity should be considered in biodiversity assessments of different taxa, including non-model yet ecologically relevant organisms.

AB Driver's stop-or-run behavior at signalized intersection has become a major concern for the intersection safety. While many studies were undertaken to model and predict drivers' stop-or-run (SoR) behaviors including Yellow-Light-Running (YLR) and Red-Light Running (RLR) using traditional statistical regression models, a critical problem for these models is that the relative influences of predictor variables on driver's SoR behavior could not be evaluated. To address this challenge, this research proposes a new approach which applies a recently developed data mining approach called gradient boosting logit model to handle different types of predictor variables, fit complex nonlinear relationships among variables, and automatically disentangle interaction effects between influential factors using high-resolution traffic and signal event data collected from loop detectors. Particularly, this research will first identify a series of related influential factors including signal timing information, surrounding traffic information, and surrounding drivers' behaviors using thousands drivers' decision events including YLR, RLR, and first-to-stop (FSTP) extracted from high-resolution loop detector data from three intersections. Then the research applies the proposed data mining approach to search for the optimal prediction model for each intersection. Furthermore, a comparison was conducted to compare the proposed new method with the traditional statistical regression model. The results show that the gradient boosting logit model has superior performance in terms of prediction accuracy. In contrast to other machine learning methods which usually apply 'black box' procedures, the gradient boosting logit model can identify and rank the relative importance of influential factors on driver's stop-or-run behavior prediction. This study brings great potential for future practical applications since loops have been widely implemented in many intersections and can collect data in real time. This research is expected to contribute to the improvement of intersection safety significantly. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB At a proximal level, the physiological impacts of global climate change on ectothermic organisms are manifest as changes in body temperatures. Especially for plants and animals exposed to direct solar radiation, body temperatures can be substantially different from air temperatures. We deployed biomimetic sensors that approximate the thermal characteristics of intertidal mussels at 71 sites worldwide, from 1998-present. Loggers recorded temperatures at 10-30 min intervals nearly continuously at multiple intertidal elevations. Comparisons against direct measurements of mussel tissue temperature indicated errors of similar to 2.0-2.5 degrees C, during daily fluctuations that often exceeded 15 degrees-20 degrees C. Geographic patterns in thermal stress based on biomimetic logger measurements were generally far more complex than anticipated based only on 'habitat-level' measurements of air or sea surface temperature. This unique data set provides an opportunity to link physiological measurements with spatially-and temporally-explicit field observations of body temperature.

AB The socio-cultural assessment of ecosystem services has been proposed as a promising tool for eliciting people's preferences towards ecosystem services. Despite an increasing integration of the socio-cultural perspective in ecosystem service research, little knowledge exists about linkages between landscape and the socio-cultural values people assign to ecosystem services. This paper combines a socio-cultural valuation approach with the use of landscape pictures to analyse and compare people's perceived importance of the provisioning, regulating, and cultural ecosystem service categories across three landscape types (i.e. larch meadows, spruce forests, and hay meadow). A survey with 470 tourists visiting the region of South Tyrol (Italy) was conducted to link people's perceived importance to their socio-demographic background and to the landscape types explored. The results show that regulating ecosystem services are preferred over provisioning and cultural services, whereby environmental awareness is found to be more influential than formal education levels regarding the perceived importance of regulating services. The results further demonstrate that cultural background is an important driver in determining people's perceived importance of cultural services. The underlying landscape types, however, exert an even stronger influence on people's socio-cultural valuation of ecosystem service categories. This finding suggests that the focus of most ecosystem services assessments on the study area as a whole risks mistakenly attributing differences in people's socio-cultural values to socio-demographic characteristics only. A better knowledge of the spatial integration of socio-cultural values, however, could help with anticipating the consequences of changes in the landscape and provide better guidance for future landscape planning.

AB With the aim to embed ecology more forcefully into decision-making, the concept of Ecosystems Services (ES) has gained significant ground amongpolicy-makers and researchers. The increasing recognition of the importance of urban green areas for the quality of life in growing cities has led proponents of ES approaches to argue for an uptake of the approach in urban environmental decision-making. However, the ES approach has been criticized for standing too much at a distance from local communities and their day-to-day practices and for insufficiently taking into account the potential trade-offs between different qualities or preferences. In this paper we argue that other concepts, doing other work, need to be added to the debate about futures of urban governance and research. Biocultural diversity is suggested as one such alternative concept. By its emphasis On diversity, biocultural diversity can account for the many ways in which people live with green areas in the urban landscape, acknowledges the different knowledges this involves, and can reveal conflicts and ambivalence that may be at stake. This sets up for a reflexive, transdisciplinary research process that questions and contextualizes knowledge and worldviews including those of researchers. A reflexive, transdisciplinary research, then, is a productive catalyst for forms of reflexive urban governance that recognise and respond to this diversity and provide platforms for contestation.

AB The size of animal home ranges often varies inversely with population density among populations of a species. This fact has implications for population monitoring using spatially explicit capture-recapture (SECR) models, in which both the scale of home-range movements sigma and population density D usually appear as parameters, and both may vary among populations. It will often be appropriate to model a structural relationship between population-specific values of these parameters, rather than to assume independence. We suggest re-parameterizing the SECR model using k(p) = sigma(p) D-p, where k(p) relates to the degree of overlap between home ranges and the subscript p distinguishes populations. We observe that k(p) is often nearly constant for populations spanning a range of densities. This justifies fitting a model in which the separate k(p) are replaced by the single parameter k and sigma(p) is a density-dependent derived parameter. Continuous density-dependent spatial variation in sigma may also be modelled, using a scaled non-Euclidean distance between detectors and the locations of animals. We illustrate these methods with data from automatic photography of tigers Panthera tigris across India, in which the variation is among populations, from mist-netting of ovenbirds Seiurus aurocapilla in Maryland, USA, in which the variation is within a single population over time, and from live-trapping of brushtail possums Trichosurus vulpecula in New Zealand, modelling spatial variation within one population. Possible applications and limitations of the methods are discussed. A model in which k(p) is constant, while density varies, provides a parsimonious null model for SECR. The parameter k of the null model is a concise summary of the empirical relationship between home-range size and density that is useful in comparative studies. We expect deviations from this model, particularly the dependence of k(p) on covariates, to be biologically interesting.

AB 1. A longstanding goal of ecology and conservation biology is to understand the environmental and biological controls of forest succession. However, the patterns and mechanisms that guide successional trajectories, especially within tropical forests, remain unclear.
   2. We collected leaf functional trait and abiotic data across a 110-year chronosequence within a tropical dry forest in Costa Rica. Focusing on six key leaf functional traits related to resource acquisition and competition, along with measures of forest stand structure, we propose a mechanistic framework to link species composition, community trait distributions and forest structure. We quantified the community-weighted trait distributions for specific leaf area, leaf dry matter concentration, leaf phosphorus concentration, leaf carbon to nitrogen ratio and leaf stable isotopic carbon and nitrogen. We assessed several prominent hypotheses for how these functional measures shift in response to changing environmental variables (soil water content, bulk density and pH) across the chronosequence.
   3. Increasingly, older forests differed significantly from younger forests in species composition, above-ground biomass and shifted trait distributions. Early stages of succession were uniformly characterized by lower values of community-weighted mean specific leaf area, leaf stable nitrogen isotope and leaf phosphorus concentration. Leaf dry matter concentration and leaf carbon to nitrogen ratio were lower during earlier stages of succession, and each trait reached an optimum during intermediate stages of succession. The leaf carbon isotope ratio was the only trait to decrease linearly with increasing stand age indicating reduced water use efficiency in older forests. However, in contrast with expectations, community-weighted trait variances did not generally change through succession, and when compared to null expectations were lower than expected.
   4. The observed directional shift in community-weighted mean trait values is consistent with the 'productivity filtering' hypothesis where a directional shift in water and light availability shifts physiological strategies from 'slow' to 'fast'. In contrast with expectations arising from niche based ecology, none of the community trait distributions were over-dispersed. Instead, patterns of trait dispersion are consistent with the abiotic filtering and/or competitive hierarchy hypotheses.

AB Hypervolumes are used widely to conceptualize niches and trait distributions for both species and communities. Some hypervolumes are expected to be convex, with boundaries defined by only upper and lower limits (e.g., fundamental niches), while others are expected to be maximal, with boundaries defined by the limits of available space (e.g., potential niches). However, observed hypervolumes (e.g., realized niches) could also have holes, defined as unoccupied hyperspace representing deviations from these expectations that may indicate unconsidered ecological or evolutionary processes. Detecting holes in more than two dimensions has to date not been possible. I develop a mathematical approach, implemented in the hypervolume R package, to infer holes in large and high-dimensional data sets. As a demonstration analysis, I assess evidence for vacant niches in a Galapagos finch community on Isabela Island. These mathematical concepts and software tools for detecting holes provide approaches for addressing contemporary research questions across ecology and evolutionary biology.

AB The success of river restoration was estimated using the ecosystem services approach. In eight pairs of restored-unrestored reaches and floodplains across Europe, we quantified provisioning (agricultural products, wood, reed for thatching, infiltrated drinking water), regulating (flooding and drainage, nutrient retention, carbon sequestration) and cultural (recreational hunting and fishing, kayaking, biodiversity conservation, appreciation of scenic landscapes) services for separate habitats within each reach, and summed these to annual economic value normalized per reach area. We used locally available data and literature, did surveys among inhabitants and visitors, and used a range of economic methods (market value, shadow price, replacement cost, avoided damage, willingness-to-pay survey, choice experiment) to provide final monetary service estimates. Total ecosystem service value was significantly increased in the restored reaches (difference 1400 +/- A 600 a,not signA ha(-1) year(-1); 2500 - 1100, p = 0.03, paired t test). Removal of one extreme case did not affect this outcome. We analysed the relation between services delivered and with floodplain and catchment characteristics after reducing these 23 variables to four principal components explaining 80% of the variance. Cultural and regulating services correlated positively with human population density, cattle density and agricultural N surplus in the catchment, but not with the fraction of arable land or forest, floodplain slope, mean river discharge or GDP. Our interpretation is that landscape appreciation and flood risk alleviation are a function of human population density, but not wealth, in areas where dairy farming is the prime form of agriculture.

AB Amphibians and reptiles are experiencing serious declines, with the number of threatened species and extinctions growing rapidly as the modern biodiversity crisis unfolds. For amphibians, the panzootic of chytridiomycosis is a major driver. For reptiles, habitat loss and harvesting from the wild are key threats. Cryopreservation and other assisted reproductive technologies (ARTs) could play a role in slowing the loss of amphibian and reptile biodiversity and managing threatened populations through genome storage and the production of live animals from stored material. These vertebrate classes are at different stages of development in cryopreservation and other ARTs, and each class faces different technical challenges arising from the separate evolutionary end-points of their reproductive biology. For amphibians, the generation of live offspring from cryopreserved spermatozoa has been achieved, but the cryopreservation of oocytes and embryos remains elusive. With reptiles, spermatozoa have been cryopreserved in a few species, but no offspring from cryopreserved spermatozoa have been reported, and the generation of live young from AI has only occurred in a small number of species. Cryopreservation and ARTs are more developed and advanced for amphibians than reptiles. Future work on both groups needs to concentrate on achieving proof of concept examples that demonstrate the use of genome storage and ARTs in successfully recovering threatened species to increase awareness and support for this approach to conservation.

AB Climate extremes and their physical impacts - including droughts, fires, floods, heat waves, storm surges and tropical cyclones - are important structuring forces in riverine ecosystems. Climate change is expected to increase the future occurrence of extremes, with potentially devastating effects on rivers and streams. We synthesise knowledge of extremes and their impacts on riverine ecosystems in Australia, a country for which projected changes in event characteristics reflect global trends. Hydrologic extremes play a major structuring role in river ecology across Australia. Droughts alter water quality and reduce habitat availability, driving organisms to refugia. Extreme floods increase hydrological connectivity and trigger booms in productivity, but can also alter channel morphology and cause disturbances such as hypoxic blackwater events. Tropical cyclones and post-cyclonic floods damage riparian vegetation, erode stream banks and alter water quality. Cyclone-induced delivery of large woody debris provides important instream habitat, although the wider ecological consequences of tropical cyclones are uncertain. Wildfires destroy catchment vegetation and expose soils, increasing inputs of fine sediment and nutrients to streams, particularly when followed by heavy rains. Research on the impacts of heat waves and storm surges is scarce, but data on temperature and salinity tolerances, respectively, may provide some insight into ecological responses. We identify research gaps and hypotheses to guide future research on the ecology of extreme climate events in Australia and beyond. A range of phenomenological, experimental and modelling approaches is needed to develop a mechanistic understanding of the ecological impact of extreme events and inform prediction of responses to future change.

AB AimStudies of fire activity along environmental gradients have been undertaken, but the results of such studies have yet to be integrated with fire-regime analysis. We characterize fire-regime components along climate gradients and a gradient of human influence.
   LocationWe focus on a climatically diverse region of north-western North America extending from northern British Columbia, Canada, to northern Utah and Colorado, USA.
   MethodsWe used a multivariate framework to collapse 12 climatic variables into two major climate gradients and binned them into 73 discrete climate domains. We examined variation in fire-regime components (frequency, size, severity, seasonality and cause) across climate domains. Fire-regime attributes were compiled from existing databases and Landsat imagery for 1897 large fires. Relationships among the fire-regime components, climate gradients and human influence were examined through bivariate regressions. The unique contribution of human influence was also assessed.
   ResultsA primary climate gradient of temperature and summer precipitation and a secondary gradient of continentality and winter precipitation in the study area were identified. Fire occupied a distinct central region of such climate space, within which fire-regime components varied considerably. We identified significant interrelations between fire-regime components of fire size, frequency, burn severity and cause. The influence of humans was apparent in patterns of burn severity and ignition cause.
   Main conclusionsWildfire activity is highest where thermal and moisture gradients converge to promote fuel production, flammability and ignitions. Having linked fire-regime components to large-scale climate gradients, we show that fire regimes - like the climate that controls them - are a part of a continuum, expanding on models of varying constraints on fire activity. The observed relationships between fire-regime components, together with the distinct role of climatic and human influences, generate variation in biotic communities. Thus, future changes to climate may lead to ecological changes through altered fire regimes.

AB Estimates of molecular genetic variation are often used as a cheap and simple surrogate for a population's adaptive potential, yet empirical evidence suggests they are unlikely to be a valid proxy. However, this evidence is based on molecular genetic variation poorly predicting estimates of adaptive potential rather than how well it predicts true values. As a consequence, the relationship has been systematically underestimated and the precision with which it could be measured severely overstated. By collating a large database, and using suitable statistical methods, we obtain a 95% upper bound of 0.26 for the proportion of variance in quantitative genetic variation explained by molecular diversity. The relationship is probably too weak to be useful, but this conclusion must be taken as provisional: less noisy estimates of quantitative genetic variation are required. In contrast, and perhaps surprisingly, current sampling strategies appear sufficient for characterising a population's molecular genetic variation at comparable markers.

AB Great efforts have been made to control soil erosion by restoring plant communities in degraded ecosystems world-wide. However, soil erosion has not been substantially reduced mainly because current restoration strategies lead to large areas of mono-specific vegetation, which are inefficient in reducing soil erosion because of their simple canopy and root structure. Therefore, an advanced understanding of how community functional composition affects soil erosion processes, as well as an improved restoration scheme to reduce soil erosion, is urgently needed. We investigated the effect of community functional composition on soil erosion in restored semi-arid grasslands on the Loess Plateau of China. Community functional composition of 16 restored grasslands was quantified by community-weighted mean (CWM) and functional diversity (FD) trait values, which were calculated from nine plant functional traits of thirteen locally dominant plant species. Species richness and evenness were also measured. Soil erosion rates were measured using standard erosion plots. The multimodel inference approach was used to estimate the direction and the relative importance of these biodiversity indices in reducing soil erosion. A robust and strong negative effect of functional divergence (FDiv) on soil erosion was found. The prevalence of particular trait combinations can also decrease soil erosion. The greatest control over soil erosion was exerted when the community mean root diameter was small and the root tensile strength was great.Synthesis and applications: These findings imply that community functional diversity plays an important role in reducing soil erosion in semi-arid restored grasslands. This means that current restoration strategies can be greatly improved by incorporating community functional diversity into restoration design. We propose a trait-based restoration framework for reducing soil erosion, termed SSM' (Screening-Simulating-Maintaining). SSM aims to translate the target of community functional diversity into community assemblages that can be manipulated by practitioners. Based on this framework, a comprehensive procedure, highlighting functional diversity as the primary concern in determining optimal community assemblages, was developed to meet the pressing need for more effective restoration strategies to reduce soil erosion.

AB The process of invasion and the desire to predict the invasiveness (and associated impacts) of new arrivals has been a focus of attention for ecologists over centuries. The volunteer recording community has made unique and inspiring contributions to our understanding of invasion biology within Britain. Indeed information on non-native species (NNS) compiled within the GB Non-Native Species Information Portal (GB-NNSIP) would not have been possible without the involvement of volunteer experts from across Britain. Here we review examples of ways in which biological records have informed invasion biology. We specifically examine NNS information available within the GB-NNSIP to describe patterns in the arrival and establishment of NNS providing an overview of habitat associations of NNS in terrestrial, marine and freshwater environments. Monitoring and surveillance of the subset of NNS that are considered to be adversely affecting biodiversity, society or the economy, termed invasive non-native species (INNS), is critical for early warning and rapid response. Volunteers are major contributors to monitoring and surveillance of INNS and not only provide records from across Britain but also underpin the system of verification necessary to confirm the identification of sightings. Here we describe the so-called alert system' which links volunteer experts with the wider recording community to provide early warning of INNS occurrence. We highlight the need to increase understanding of community and ecosystem-level effects of invasions and particularly understanding of ecological resilience. Detailed field observations, through biological recording, will provide the spatial, temporal and taxonomic breadth required for such research. The role of the volunteer recording community in contributing to the understanding of invasion biology has been invaluable and it is clear that their expertise and commitment will continue to be so.(c) 2015 The Linnean Society of London.

AB Background The cost-benefit model for the evolution of botanical carnivory provides a conceptual framework for interpreting a wide range of comparative and experimental studies on carnivorous plants. This model assumes that the modified leaves called traps represent a significant cost for the plant, and this cost is outweighed by the benefits from increased nutrient uptake from prey, in terms of enhancing the rate of photosynthesis per unit leaf mass or area (AN) in the microsites inhabited by carnivorous plants.
   Scope This review summarizes results from the classical interpretation of the cost-benefit model for evolution of botanical carnivory and highlights the costs and benefits of active trapping mechanisms, including water pumping, electrical signalling and accumulation of jasmonates. Novel alternative sequestration strategies (utilization of leaf litter and faeces) in carnivorous plants are also discussed in the context of the cost-benefit model.
   Conclusions Traps of carnivorous plants have lower AN than leaves, and the leaves have higher AN after feeding. Prey digestion, water pumping and electrical signalling represent a significant carbon cost (as an increased rate of respiration, RD) for carnivorous plants. On the other hand, jasmonate accumulation during the digestive period and reprogramming of gene expression from growth and photosynthesis to prey digestion optimizes enzyme production in comparison with constitutive secretion. This inducibility may have evolved as a cost-saving strategy beneficial for carnivorous plants. The similarities between plant defence mechanisms and botanical carnivory are highlighted.

AB Loss of biodiversity impacts ecosystem functions, such as carbon (C) cycling. Soils are the largest terrestrial C reservoir, containing more C globally than the biotic and atmospheric pools together. As such, soil C cycling, and the processes controlling it, has the potential to affect atmospheric CO2 concentrations and subsequent climate change. Despite the growing evidence of links between plant diversity and soil C cycling, there is a dearth of information on whether similar relationships exist between soil biodiversity and C cycling. This knowledge gap occurs even though there has been increased recognition that soil communities display high levels of both taxonomic and functional diversity and are key drivers of fluxes of C between the atmosphere and terrestrial ecosystems. Here, we used meta-analysis and regression analysis to quantitatively assess how soil biodiversity affects soil C cycling pools and processes (i.e., soil C respiration, litter decomposition, and plant biomass). We compared the response of process variables to changes in diversity both within and across groups of soil organisms that differed in body size, a grouping that typically correlates with ecological function. When studies that manipulated both within-and across-body size group diversity were included in the meta-analysis, loss of diversity significantly reduced soil C respiration (-27.5%) and plant tissue decomposition (-18%) but did not affect above- or belowground plant biomass. The loss of within-group diversity significantly reduced soil C respiration, while loss of across-group diversity did not. Decomposition was negatively affected both by loss of within-group and across-group diversity. Furthermore, loss of microbial diversity strongly reduced soil C respiration (-41%). In contrast, plant tissue decomposition was negatively affected by loss of soil faunal diversity but was unaffected by loss of microbial diversity. Taken together, our findings show that loss of soil biodiversity strongly impacts on soil C cycling processes, and highlight the importance of diversity across groups of organisms (e.g, primary consumers and secondary decomposers) for maintaining full functionality of C cycle processes. However, our understanding of the complex relationships between soil biodiversity and C cycling processes is currently limited by the sheer number of methodological concerns associated with these studies, which can greatly overestimate or underestimate the impact of soil biodiversity on soil C cycling, challenging extrapolation to natural field settings. Future studies should attempt to further elucidate the relative importance of taxonomic diversity (species numbers) versus functional diversity.

AB Natural systems harbor complex interactions that are fundamental parts of ecology and evolution. These interactions challenge our inclinations and training to seek the simplest explanations of patterns in nature. Not least is the likelihood that some complex processes might be missed when their patterns look similar to predictions for simpler mechanisms. Along these lines, theory and empirical evidence increasingly suggest that environmental, ecological, phenotypic, and genetic processes can be tightly intertwined, resulting in complex and sometimes surprising eco-evolutionary dynamics. The goal of this review is to temper inclinations to unquestioningly seek the simplest explanations in ecology and evolution, by recognizing that some eco-evolutionary outcomes may appear very similar to purely ecological, purely evolutionary, or even null expectations, and thus be cryptic. We provide theoretical and empirical evidence for observational biases and mechanisms that might operate among the various links in eco-evolutionary feedbacks to produce cryptic patterns. Recognition that cryptic dynamics can be associated with outcomes like stability, resilience, recovery, or coexistence in a dynamically changing world provides added impetus for finding ways to study them.

AB As species' geographic ranges and ecosystem functions are altered in response to climate change, there is a need to integrate biodiversity conservation approaches that promote natural adaptation into land use planning. Successful conservation will need to embrace multiple climate adaptation approaches. but to date they have not been conveyed in an integrated way to help support immediate conservation planning and action in the face of inherent spatial uncertainty about future conditions. Instead, these multiple approaches are often conveyed as competing or contradictory alternatives, when in fact, they are complementary. We present a framework that synthesizes six promising spatially explicit adaptation approaches for conserving biodiversity. We provide guidance on implementing these adaptation approaches and include case studies that highlight how biodiversity conservation can be used in planning. We conclude with general guidance on choosing appropriate climate adaptation approaches to amend for conservation planning.

AB Recent years have seen a rapid expansion of the model space explored in statistical phylogenetics, emphasizing the need for new approaches to statistical model representation and software development. Clear communication and representation of the chosen model is crucial for: (i) reproducibility of an analysis, (ii) model development, and (iii) software design. Moreover, a unified, clear and understandable framework for model representation lowers the barrier for beginners and nonspecialists to grasp complex phylogenetic models, including their assumptions and parameter/variable dependencies. Graphical modeling is a unifying framework that has gained in popularity in the statistical literature in recent years. The core idea is to break complex models into conditionally independent distributions. The strength lies in the comprehensibility, flexibility, and adaptability of this formalism, and the large body of computational work based on it. Graphical models are well-suited to teach statistical models, to facilitate communication among phylogeneticists and in the development of generic software for simulation and statistical inference. Here, we provide an introduction to graphical models for phylogeneticists and extend the standard graphical model representation to the realm of phylogenetics. We introduce a new graphical model component, tree plates, to capture the changing structure of the subgraph corresponding to a phylogenetic tree. We describe a range of phylogenetic models using the graphical model framework and introduce modules to simplify the representation of standard components in large and complex models. Phylogenetic model graphs can be readily used in simulation, maximum likelihood inference, and Bayesian inference using, for example, Metropolis-Hastings or Gibbs sampling of the posterior distribution.

AB Forest die-off caused by mountain pine beetle (MPB; Dendroctonus ponderosa) is rapidly transforming western North American landscapes. The rapid and widespread death of lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) will likely have cascading effects on biodiversity. One group particularly prone to such declines associated with MPB are ectomycorrhizal fungi, symbiotic organisms that can depend on pine for their survival, and are critical for stand regeneration. We evaluated the indirect effects of MPB on above- (community composition of epigeous sporocarps) and belowground (hyphal abundance) occurrences of ectomycorrhizal fungi across 11 forest stands. Along a gradient of mortality (0-82% pine killed), macromycete community composition changed; this shift was driven by a decrease in the species richness of ectomycorrhizal fungi. Both the proportion of species that were ectomycorrhizal and hyphal length in the soil declined with increased MPB-caused pine mortality; 70% in stands without MPB attacks. The rapid range expansion of a native insect results not only in the widespread mortality of an ecologically and economically important pine species, but the effect of MPB may also be exacerbated by the concomitant decline of fungi crucial for recovery of these forests.

AB Background: The avian Order Passeriformes is an enormously species-rich group, which comprises almost 60% of all living bird species. This diverse order is believed to have originated before the break-up of Gondwana in the late Cretaceous. However, previous molecular dating studies have relied heavily on the geological split between New Zealand and Antarctica, assumed to have occurred 85-82 Mya, for calibrating the molecular clock and might thus be circular in their argument.
   Results: This study provides a time-scale for the evolution of the major clades of passerines using seven nuclear markers, five taxonomically well-determined passerine fossils, and an updated interpretation of the New Zealand split from Antarctica 85-52 Mya in a Bayesian relaxed-clock approach. We also assess how different interpretations of the New Zealand-Antarctica vicariance event influence our age estimates. Our results suggest that the diversification of Passeriformes began in the late Cretaceous or early Cenozoic. Removing the root calibration for the New Zealand-Antarctica vicariance event (85-52 Mya) dramatically increases the 95% credibility intervals and leads to unrealistically old age estimates. We assess the individual characteristics of the seven nuclear genes analyzed in our study. Our analyses provide estimates of divergence times for the major groups of passerines, which can be used as secondary calibration points in future molecular studies.
   Conclusions: Our analysis takes recent paleontological and geological findings into account and provides the best estimate of the passerine evolutionary time-scale currently available. This time-scale provides a temporal framework for further biogeographical, ecological, and co-evolutionary studies of the largest bird radiation, and adds to the growing support for a Cretaceous origin of Passeriformes.

AB Threats to species from commercial fishing are rarely identified until species have suffered large population declines, by which time remedial actions can have severe economic consequences, such as closure of fisheries. Many of the species most threatened by fishing are caught in multispecies fisheries, which can remain profitable even as populations of some species collapse. Here we show for multispecies fisheries that the biological and socioeconomic conditions that would eventually cause species to be severely depleted or even driven extinct can be identified decades before those species experience high harvest rates or marked population declines. Because fishing effort imposes a common source of mortality on all species in a fishery, the long- term impact of a fishery on a species is predicted by measuring its loss rate relative to that of species that influence the fishery's maximal effort. We tested our approach on eight Pacific tuna and billfish populations, four of which have been identified recently as in decline and threatened with overfishing. The severe depletion of all four populations could have been predicted in the 1950s, using our approach. Our results demonstrate that species threatened by human harvesting can be identified much earlier, providing time for adjustments in harvesting practices before consequences become severe and fishery closures or other socioeconomically disruptive interventions are required to protect species.

AB Invasion ecology has much advanced since its early beginnings. Nevertheless, explanation, prediction, and management of biological invasions remain difficult. We argue that progress in invasion research can be accelerated by, first, pointing out difficulties this field is currently facing and, second, looking for measures to overcome them. We see basic and applied research in invasion ecology confronted with difficulties arising from (A) societal issues, e.g., disparate perceptions of invasive species; (B) the peculiarity of the invasion process, e.g., its complexity and context dependency; and (C) the scientific methodology, e.g., imprecise hypotheses. To overcome these difficulties, we propose three key measures: (1) a checklist for definitions to encourage explicit definitions; (2) implementation of a hierarchy of hypotheses (HoH), where general hypotheses branch into specific and precisely testable hypotheses; and (3) platforms for improved communication. These measures may significantly increase conceptual clarity and enhance communication, thus advancing invasion ecology.

AB A great deal has been published in the scientific literature regarding the effects of wind energy development and operation on volant (flying) wildlife including birds and bats, although knowledge of how to mitigate negative impacts is still imperfect. We reviewed the peer-reviewed scientific literature for information on the known and potential effects of utility-scale wind energy development and operation (USWEDO) on terrestrial and marine non-volant wildlife and found that very little has been published on the topic. Following a similar review for solar energy we identified known and potential effects due to construction and eventual decommissioning of wind energy facilities. Many of the effects are similar and include direct mortality, environmental impacts of destruction and modification of habitat including impacts of roads, and offsite impacts related to construction material acquisition, processing and transportation. Known and potential effects due to operation and maintenance of facilities include habitat fragmentation and barriers to gene flow, as well as effects due to noise, vibration and shadow flicker, electromagnetic field generation, macro- and micro-climate change, predator attraction, and increased fire risk. The scarcity of before-after-control-impact studies hinders the ability to rigorously quantify the effects of USWEDO on non-volant wildlife. We conclude that more empirical data are currently needed to fully assess the impact of USWEDO on non-volant wildlife. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Vector-based risk assessment is a powerful and efficient management approach for nonindigenous species (NIS). By managing a vector, an entire assemblage of associated NIS is simultaneously considered. The majority of current risk assessment frameworks have been conducted for a single, or selected few, target species and thus are not useful for managing vectors transporting a large number of potentially unknown species. Here we develop a predictive framework to assess relative invasion risk for a vector (ballast water) transporting an unknown species assemblage, using the Canadian Arctic as a case study. Ballast water discharge is a known high-risk vector globally, but its magnitude in the Arctic has not been well characterized. Our framework determined relative invasion risks between different transit pathways by quantifying the probability of NIS successfully transiting all stages of the invasion process and the magnitude of consequences of introduction to those ports. Churchill, Manitoba was ranked at 'higher' invasion risk via ballast water discharged by international merchant vessels than any other recipient port studied. The overall pattern of ballast water discharge suggests that water originating from coastal domestic sources carried by international merchant vessels may be important for dispersal of NIS. In addition, ballast-mediated NIS are more likely to arrive to the Hudson Bay region during summer months. These results can be useful for developing prevention and early detection programs for the region. Our risk assessment framework is not limited to ballast water and could be applied to other vectors for effective management of NIS.

AB The small (2- to 7-kg) leopard cat (Prionailurus bengalensis) is the most common cat species in Asia. Although it occurs in a wide range of habitats and seems to adapt well to anthropogenic habitat changes, surprisingly little is known about this species in the wild. All studies have focused on protected areas, although a large proportion of Southeast Asian forests are timber concessions. During this study, we used large camera-trapping data sets (783 records of 124 individuals) from 3 commercially used forests to investigate consequences of different logging regimes on density and habitat associations of the leopard cat. We applied spatial capture recapture models accounting for the location of camera-traps (on or off road) to obtain estimates of leopard cat density. Density was higher in the 2 more disturbed forest reserves ((X) over bar = 12.4 individuals/100 km(2) +/- 1.6 SE and 16.5 +/- 2 individuals/100 km(2)) than in the sustainably managed forest (9.6 +/- 1.7 individuals/100 km(2)). Encounter rates with off-road traps were only 3.6-9.1% of those for on-road traps. Occupancy models, which accounted for spatial autocorrelation between sampling sites by using a conditional autoregressive model, revealed that canopy closure and ratio of climax to pioneer trees had a significantly negative impact on leopard cat occurrence. Our results confirm that the leopard cat is doing well in modified landscapes and even seems to benefit from the opening of forests. With such flexibility the leopard cat is an exception among tropical rain-forest carnivores.

AB Atlantic heaths are semi-natural habitats of high biodiversity interest which once covered large areas of the Atlantic Region. Nowadays these heathlands are dramatically reduced in many countries although they still cover wide areas in the north-west Iberian Peninsula, especially in the poorest and most socially marginal areas that are frequently affected by wildfires. We review the role of livestock grazing as a sustainable management strategy for heathlands in Europe. We have worked on a generalized conceptual framework for the management of a resource of nutritional and environmental value by drawing together evidence from studies of the livestock and the community ecology of grazed plants and the associated fauna. Key factors that influence grazing impact, such as type of livestock (animal species and breed) and their management are discussed. Goats thrive better than sheep, and horses than cattle, when heathland vegetation is the predominant resource available. Regardless of the type of livestock species managed, the low nutritive value of this vegetation hinders the maintenance of productive groups of suckler dams with offspring through the grazing season. The nutritional requirements of livestock can be met by adding improved pasture areas to heathlands. Under that strategy, sheep have the best productive performance and cattle the poorest. Management of mixed flocks with goats can lead to a more efficient use of vegetation, improve productivity and develop a patchier habitat which supports a richer associated fauna. Overall the results indicate that the sustainability of livestock grazing in these marginal lands will be achieved if they are managed effectively according to the available vegetation and their effects on the biodiversity.

   PREDICTION
AB Variations in area burnt by fire are governed by four processes: biomass growth, availability to burn, fire weather and ignitions. Insight into these how these processes are shaped by biophysical and human influences is required to underpin the development of effective management strategies. Patterns of natural and arson ignitions were examined within the densely populated Sydney region of south-eastern Australia to determine the extent to which management can alter the risk of ignition. Arson ignitions were more likely on ridges in association with human infrastructure, i.e. roads and houses. Lightning ignitions also occurred more frequently on ridges, but at greater distances from human infrastructure. These patterns are consistent with those reported in studies from forested regions in the northern hemisphere. Fuel age had a variable effect with lightning more likely in older fuels (>25 years) and arson more likely in younger fuels (<10 years). Probability of both ignition types increased under more severe fire weather. Climate change is predicted to increase the severity of fire weather and is therefore likely to result in an increase in ignition frequency in the Sydney Basin. Urban expansion is also likely to have significant effects on ignitions and resultant risks to people and property via an increase in the probability of arson ignitions.

AB Over a 2 year period, we compared the soil biological functioning (SBF) of Cerrado physiognomies ranging from grassland-savannic to forest formations, sampling in the middle of the dry and rainy seasons.
   Soil samples were collected at two depths (0 to 5 cm and 5 to 20 cm) under the following physiognomies: Campo Sujo, Cerrado Ralo, Cerrado sensu stricto, Cerrado and Mata de Galeria. The SBF was represented by the simultaneous analyses of microbial biomass carbon, soil basal respiration and the activity of enzymes linked to the C, P and S cycles (beta-glucosidase, acid phosphatase and arylsulfatase, respectively).
   The results demonstrated that Cerrado physiognomies are a major determinant of SBF patterns. The forest-like physiognomies (Mata de Galeria and Cerrado) presented the highest biomass and activity compared to the grassland (Campo Sujo) and savanna physiognomies (Cerrado Ralo and Cerrado sensu stricto). These differences were more evident in the topsoil layer (0 to 5 cm), and the seasonal effect on the SBF of the Mata de Galeria and Cerrado was more pronounced than on the other physiognomies.
   These results provide a benchmark for evaluating changes in SBF and related processes in Cerrado areas due to shifts toward agriculture and cattle production.

AB Roadways are increasingly recognized as common points of entry for non-native species into natural habitats in mountainous areas. Studies were conducted within the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem from 2003 to 2007 to evaluate (1) landscape scale patterns of non-native plant richness along roadways, and (2) local scale factors influencing native and non-native plant richness and cover, and surrogate non-native plant (SNP) emergence in an invaded habitat. At the landscape scale, non-native plant richness decreased with increased elevation and increased distance from the road, and was positively correlated to the proportion of plots with signs of disturbance. Non-native plant richness also varied by habitat type: sagebrush steppe had the highest and alpine the lowest. At the local scale, in sagebrush steppe, SNP emergence was negatively associated with increased distance from the road, and percent cover of litter was positively associated with SNP emergence. The proportion of non-native plant cover and richness decreased, while the proportion of native cover and native species richness increased with distance from road. Our study suggests that landscape scale variables such as elevation and habitat type influence non-native plant success, and that while local conditions adjacent to the road may be favorable for non-native plants, factors which vary at the local scale can also effect non-native plant establishment away from the roadside. This highlights the need for studies to evaluate multiple scales when assessing patterns and processes driving non-native plant invasions, and suggests that sagebrush steppe may be resistant to invasion as long as it remains undisturbed.

AB Bed bugs (Cimex lectularius L.) are a resurgent pest worldwide and infestations within the United States are increasing at a rapid rate. Because of the physical and psychological discomfort inflicted by their blood feeding habits, and allergies and secondary infections associated with bites, bed bugs are recognized as a significant public health problem. Although bed bug infestations are spreading and becoming more prevalent, we have a poor understanding of their dispersal patterns and sources of infestation. To help fill this gap, we conducted a genetic study of 21 bed bug infestations from the eastern United States, nearly all of which came from single rooms within residences. We genotyped samples comprised of 8-10 individuals per infestation at nine polymorphic microsatellite loci. Despite high genetic diversity across all infestations, with 5-17 alleles per locus (mean = 10.3 alleles per locus), we found low genetic diversity (1-4 alleles per locus) within all but one of the infestations. These results suggest that nearly all the studied infestations were started by a small propagule possibly consisting of a singly mated female and/or her progeny, or a female mated with multiple males that were highly related to her. All infestations were strongly genetically differentiated from each other (mean pairwise F ST between populations = 0.68) and we did not find strong evidence of a geographic pattern of genetic structure, indicating infestations located in closer proximity to each other were nearly as genetically differentiated as those located hundreds of kilometers away. The high level of genetic diversity across infestations from the eastern United States together with the lack of geographically organized structure is consistent with multiple introductions into the United States from foreign sources.

AB This paper compares the historic German discourse on forest functions with the current international debate on ecosystem services and analyzes the factors that may have triggered or inhibited the development and the institutionalization of both underlying concepts and subordinate debates. Ultimately, this comparison aims at drawing conclusions for the present debate on the currently negotiated REDDplus mechanism which can be considered as a major effort to upscale payments for environmental services.
   Both discourses show some remarkable similarities - despite their diverging spatial foci, cultural backgrounds, and eras of origin. Similarities include the utilitarian concepts of nature used, the functions or services considered, and the ongoing challenge of valuing and monetizing them. However, there are also fundamental differences in regard to property rights and assumptions on the harmony of forest functions, respectively apparent and potential trade-offs between different ecosystem services for which the current discourse promotes market-based governance approaches as the mean of choice to balance competing interests of stakeholders.
   In terms of current policy debates as on REDDplus, the focus on one particular ecosystem service - here the mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions - shows significant analogies to the historic forest functions discourse in which timber production was seen as the main function that inherently ensures the delivery of all other functions. With regard to the considerable risks resulting for biodiversity and other ecosystem services from such a mono-functional focus we argue that any market-based approach to REDDplus should be accompanied by comprehensive international and national regulatory policies and foster the implementation of effective safeguards.

AB Literature data are reviewed on the origin, distribution, economic benefits and impacts of common carp Cyprinus carpio L. in the Mediterranean region. Despite the ubiquity of domesticated and feral forms, wild populations of the genetically pure ancestor are still found in confined areas of Thrace and Northern Anatolia, and possibly in eastern parts of Greece. Introductions and translocations throughout the region from at least Roman times have been driven by a combination of historical, economic and cultural motives, which have contributed to the spread of the species into many freshwater systems. Although impacts have been either documented or suspected in most areas of distribution, and intervention by biomanipulation successfully implemented in some water bodies, there is a compelling need for more focused research in more vulnerable areas characterised by drier/warmer and overall more unpredictable climate conditions, which appear to favour successful common carp population dynamics. In contrast to large-scale (i.e. country-wide) control measures, likely to prove unfeasible because of the intrinsically high costs associated and/or loss of revenue from sport fishing and fisheries activities, localised (integrated) management actions, followed by post-intervention monitoring, are likely to benefit targeted water bodies for increased amenity and restoration value.

AB Climate change is expected to alter disturbance regimes with profound effects on the structure and dynamics of ecological communities. In many regions, climate models forecast shifts in precipitation patterns that will exacerbate droughts in rivers and streams, yet ecological impacts on freshwater ecosystems remain poorly understood. We report the results of a stream mesocosm experiment designed to test the effect of drought on the resilience of replicate macroinvertebrate communities, via direct manipulation of flows. Drying disturbances applied at high (monthly) and low (quarterly) frequency over 21-months had contrasting effects on the structure and temporal dynamics of the communities. Macroinvertebrates were resilient to low-frequency disturbance, sustaining abundant and diverse communities, which developed over experimental time. By comparison, high-frequency disturbance exceeded the capacity for recovery, skewing community structure, and generated relatively impoverished, static assemblages dominated by fewer species. Species responses ranged from extirpation to irruption, with smaller short-lived taxa (<= 1 generation per year), notably chironomids and worms, replacing larger taxa with longer life cycles (>= 1 generation per year). This research provides one of the first experimental tests of resilience to drought in aquatic ecosystems.

AB Various factors constrain the existence and development of inland fishes and fisheries, such as pollution, habitat degradation, alien invasive species, local user conflicts, low social priority and inadequate research and funding. In many cases, however, degradation of the environment and loss of aquatic habitat are the predominant concerns for the conservation of freshwater aquatic biota. The need for concerted effort to prevent and reduce environmental degradation, as well as protection of freshwater fishes and fisheries as renewable common pool resources or entities in their own right, are the greatest challenges facing the conservation of fishes in inland waters. Unfortunately, traditional conservation practices such as regulation of exploitation, protected areas and habitat restoration have failed to arrest the alarming increase in number of threatened freshwater fish species worldwide. This paper examines the shifting paradigm of fisheries management from rule-based regulation, through fishery enhancement towards the ecosystem approach to fisheries, with reference to inland waters, and how the emerging concept of ecosystem services coupled with traditional fish conservation management practices, institutional restructuring and integrated management planning should provide a more sustainable thrust to formulation and promotion of fish conservation initiatives.

AB Leposoma is a conspicuous component of leaf litter herpetofauna of South and Central American rainforests. The 15 bisexual and one parthenogenetic species are allocated to the parietale and scincoides groups based on morphology. Phylogenetic analyses of 1830 bp (mtDNA + nuclear) were performed on 63 specimens of four species from Amazonian and Panamanian rainforests, and six species and one undescribed form from the Atlantic Forest. Different methods of tree reconstruction were explored, with Anotosaura vanzolinia and Colobosauroides cearensis as outgroups. The monophyly of the parietale and scincoides groups is strongly supported. Contrary to previous hypotheses suggesting a recent contact between Atlantic and Amazon forests, our estimates point to an initial split in Miocene. The position of Leposoma baturitensis, endemic to relictual forests in the semiarid Caatingas northeastern Brazil, and its divergence from the remaining species of the Atlantic Forest, suggests an ancient isolation with no indication of a secondary contact with forests of the eastern coast. Our data do not permit unambiguous assignment of parental species of the unisexual Leposoma percarinatum or the mechanism involved in the origin of parthenogenesis, but revealed two highly divergent diploid and triploid lineages within L percarinatum, indicating that the unisexuals represent a species complex.

AB Edaphic fauna contributes to important ecosystem functions in grassland soils such as decomposition and nutrient mineralization. Since this functional role is likely to be altered by global change and associated shifts in plant communities, a thorough understanding of large scale drivers on below-ground processes independent of regional differences in soil type or climate is essential. We investigated the relationship between abiotic (soil properties, management practices) and biotic (plant functional group composition, vegetation characteristics, soil fauna abundance) predictors and feeding activity of soil fauna after accounting for sample year and study region. Our study was carried out over a period of two consecutive years in 92 agricultural grasslands in three regions of Germany, spanning a latitudinal gradient of more than 500 km. A structural equation model suggests that feeding activity of soil fauna as measured by the bait-lamina test was positively related to legume and grass species richness in both years. Most probably, a diverse vegetation promotes feeding activity of soil fauna via alterations of both microclimate and resource availability. Feeding activity of soil fauna also increased with earthworm biomass via a pathway over Collembola abundance. The effect of earthworms on the feeding activity in soil may be attributed to their important role as ecosystem engineers. As no additional effects of agricultural management such as fertilization, livestock density or number of cuts on bait consumption were observed, our results suggest that the positive effect of legume and grass species richness on the feeding activity in soil fauna is a general one that will not be overruled by regional differences in management or environmental conditions. We thus suggest that agri-environment schemes aiming at the protection of belowground activity and associated ecosystem functions in temperate grasslands may generally focus on maintaining plant diversity, especially with regard to the potential effects of climate change on future vegetation structure.

AB Protecting native biodiversity against alien invasive species requires powerful methods to anticipate these invasions and to protect native species assumed to be at risk. Here, we describe how species distribution models (SDMs) can be used to identify areas predicted as both suitable for rare native species and highly susceptible to invasion by alien species, at present and under future climate and land-use scenarios. To assess the condition and dynamics of such conflicts, we developed a combined predictive modelling (CPM) approach, which predicts species distributions by combining two SDMs fitted using subsets of predictors classified as acting at either regional or local scales. We illustrate the CPM approach for an alien invader and a rare species associated with similar habitats in northwest Portugal. Combined models predict a wider variety of potential species responses, providing more informative projections of species distributions and future dynamics than traditional, non-combined models. They also provide more informative insight regarding current and future rare-invasive conflict areas. For our studied species, conflict areas of highest conservation relevance are predicted to decrease over the next decade, supporting previous reports that some invasive species may contract their geographic range and impact due to climate change. More generally, our results highlight the more informative character of the combined approach to address practical issues in conservation and management programs, especially those aimed at mitigating the impact of invasive plants, land-use and climate changes in sensitive regions.

AB Question: What is the effect of climate change on tree species abundance and distribution in the Italian peninsula?
   Location: Italian peninsula.
   Methods: Regression tree analysis, Random Forest, generalized additive model and geostatistical methods were compared to identify the best model for quantifying the effect of climate change on tree species distribution and abundance. Future potential species distribution, richness, local colonization, local extinction and species turnover were modelled according to two scenarios (A2 and B1) for 2050 and 2080.
   Results: Robust Random Forest proved to be the best statistical model to predict the potential distribution of tree species abundance. Climate change could lead to a shift in tree species distribution towards higher altitudes and a reduction of forest cover. Pinus sylvestris and Tilia cordata may be considered at risk of local extinction, while the other species could find potential suitable areas at the cost of a rearrangement of forest community composition and increasing competition.
   Conclusions: Geographical and topographical regional characteristics can have a noticeable influence on the impact of predicted climate change on forest ecosystems within the Mediterranean basin. It would be highly beneficial to create a standardized and harmonized European forest inventory in order to evaluate, at high resolution, the effect of climate change on forest ecosystems, identify regional differences and develop specific adaptive management strategies and plans.

   WHALES
AB The ecology and status of Risso's dolphins Grampus griseus worldwide are poorly known. In the Mediterranean Sea, modern field studies of cetaceans only began in the late 1980s and this has resulted in rapid advances in knowledge of some species, but not Risso's dolphin. This paper reviews available information on the distribution and ecology of Risso's dolphins in the Mediterranean and identifies factors that may negatively affect them in this region. Risso's dolphins occur in continental slope waters throughout the Mediterranean basin and around many of the region's offshore islands and archipelagos. No synoptic estimate of abundance is available for the Mediterranean region, but densities and overall numbers are low in comparison to some other small odontocetes. Diet consists primarily of cephalopods, with a clear preference for mesopelagic squid. The principal known threat to populations in the Mediterranean is entanglement in pelagic drift gillnets. Other potential problems for Risso's dolphins in the Mediterranean include noise disturbance and ingestion of plastic debris. Conservation actions to mitigate the risk of entanglement in fishing gear are likely to benefit Risso's dolphins; specifically, the existing driftnet ban in EU waters should be strictly enforced and extended to the high seas and to waters under non-EU State jurisdiction. More and better data are needed on abundance, distribution, movements, population dynamics and trends in Risso's dolphin populations, and better information on threats (e.g. bycatch in fishing gear) is needed to inform conservation efforts.

AB Worldwide ecosystems are modified by human activities and climate change. To be able to predict future changes, it is necessary to understand their respective role on population dynamics. Among the most threatened species are top predators because of their position in the food web. Albatross populations are potentially affected by both human activities, especially longline fisheries, and climatic fluctuations. Based on long-term data (1985-2006), we conducted through a comparative approach a demographic analysis (adult survival and breeding success) on four albatross species breeding on the Indian Ocean sub-Antarctic Islands to assess the relative impact of climate and fisheries during and outside the breeding season. The study revealed that adult survival of almost all species was not affected by climate, and therefore probably canalized against climatic variations, but was negatively affected by tuna longlining effort in three species. Breeding success was affected by climate, with contrasted effects between species, with Southern Oscillation Index having an impact on all species but one. Differences in demographic responses depended on the foraging zone and season. In order to predict population trajectories of seabirds such as albatrosses, our results show the importance of assessing the relative influence of fishing and climate impacts on demography.

We studied the effect of forest road distance on plant understory diversity at 20 sites in young and adult oak stands in a French lowland forest with a long history of management and road construction. All vascular and bryophyte species were collected at five distances ranging from the road verge to 100 m into the adjacent forest stand. We analysed species composition, individual species response, a priori life-history traits response - life form, habitat preference and dispersal mode - and environmental indicator values in relation to road distance and stand age. Plant composition strongly differed between road verge and forest interior habitats. The main road effect extended less than 5 m into the forest stand. A third habitat was detected at the forest-road edge resulting from the road effect on light and soil conditions, and from edge-specific topography. Non-forest species were almost absent from the forest interior. In contrast, many bryophytes and several vascular plants kept away from the road. We identified a posteriori six species groups that better explained the variability of plant response profiles than a priori life-history traits. Plant response to road distance was also dependent on stand age: some species colonised from the road into the forest interior in young stands following regeneration cutting, while other species displayed the reverse pattern in adult stands once canopy closed above the forest road. Even if the depth of forest road effect measured in lowland managed stands was narrow, building of a new forest road has non-negligible effects on plant population dynamics. Forest managers should take into account the impacts of roads on biodiversity, since the expected intensification of silviculture in response to global changes is set to accentuate the effect of forest roads. We recommend further study on the role of dispersal by vehicles (i.e. agestochory) in road effects. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Aim
   Climatic factors are known to influence species distributions. However, elucidating the underlying mechanisms is challenging because direct and indirect effects of climatic and non-climatic factors are correlated. In the absence of this covariation and at fine-grain resolutions the direct effect of climate via physiological constraints should be stronger on the distributions of ectothermic organisms. So far, no comprehensive study has explicitly tested the influence of climate on species distributions by quantitatively comparing ectothermic and endothermic vertebrates.
   Location
   Peninsular Spain.
   Methods
   Presence-absence data of native terrestrial vertebrates in Peninsular Spain were modelled using generalized additive models to disentangle the influence of climate and other contemporary correlated factors (topography and plant cover). We performed partial regressions to partition the deviance explained by climatic and non-climatic effects into independent and shared components. We compared the independent contributions of climatic and non-climatic effects between ectothermic and endothermic vertebrates, and among mammals, birds, reptiles and amphibians.
   Results
   After reducing the covariation with non-climatic factors, climate explained a greater proportion of deviance in ectotherms than in endotherms. Also, the contribution of temperature was highest for reptiles, and the contribution of precipitation was highest for amphibians, after extracting their overlaps with precipitation and temperature, respectively. The contribution of topography and plant cover remained high for birds after extracting the overlap with climate.
   Main conclusions
   Our results are consistent with the prediction that, at fine resolutions, the direct influence of climate (via physiological constraints) on range distributions is stronger in ectothermic vertebrates. Also, at least for birds, indirect effects of climate (via plant productivity) and other habitat characteristics remained relatively important once their covariation with climate was reduced. This study shows that controlling the direct effects of climate by their indirect effects and/or other correlated factors, combined with comparisons among functional groups, can be a useful approach to elucidate causal links with the spatial patterns of organisms.

AB As the climate warms, many species are showing altered phenology patterns, potentially disrupting synchrony between interacting species. Recent studies have documented disrupted synchrony in plant-herbivore and predator-prey interactions. However, studies investigating climate-related asynchrony in host-parasitoid interactions and exploring the relative responses of interacting hosts and parasitoids to climate change are lacking. This is an important gap in knowledge given the ubiquity of insect parasitoids and their importance in influencing the abundance and dynamics of their hosts. In the threatened marsh fritillary butterfly Euphydryas aurinia (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae) and its specialized parasitoid, Cotesia bignellii (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) phenological synchrony (and consequently population fluctuations) are thought to be weather-dependent. To assess the likely influence of climate and microenvironment change on synchrony between E. aurinia and C. bignellii, we experimentally manipulated the exposure of sensitive-stage host larvae and parasitoid pupae to temperature (ambient or elevated) and shading (shaded or unshaded) regimes. We also analysed a 20-year population dynamic dataset from the United Kingdom for E. aurinia to investigate whether population variations could be explained by interannual variations in the thermal and sunshine environment. Development times were affected significantly by the experimental temperature and shading treatments for E. aurinia but not for C. bignellii. However, the contrasting responses were insufficient to significantly affect host availability for parasitoids. In the field, thermal and sunshine conditions did not influence population fluctuations, and population variations across a large (UK-wide) scale were uncorrelated. Changes to the thermal and sunshine environment of the magnitude investigated in our experiment and within the range experienced by wild E. aurinia populations over the last 20-years thus seem unlikely to cause breakdown in host-parasitoid synchrony. We suggest that experiments investigating the mechanistic responses of interacting species to environmental change are needed to support the analysis and interpretation of observational data on species' phenology.

AB Pilot whales (Globicephala spp.) provide an interesting example of recently diverged oceanic species with a complex evolutionary history. The two species have wide but largely non-overlapping ranges. Globicephala melas (long-finned pilot whale; LFPW) has an antitropical distribution and is found in the cold-temperate waters of the North Atlantic and Southern Hemisphere, whereas Globicephala macrorhynchus (short-finned pilot whale; SFPW) has a circumglobal distribution and is found mainly in the tropics and subtropics. To investigate pilot whale evolution and biogeography, we analysed worldwide population structure using mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region sequences (up to 620 bp) from a variety of sources (LFPW = 643; SFPW = 150), including strandings in New Zealand and Tasmania, and whale-meat products purchased on the markets of Japan and Korea. Phylogenetic reconstructions failed to support a reciprocal monophyly of the two species, despite six diagnostic substitutions, possibly because of incomplete lineage sorting or inadequate phylogenetic information. Both species had low haplotype and nucleotide diversity compared to other abundant widespread cetaceans (LFPW, pi = 0.35%; SFPW, pi = 0.87%) but showed strong mtDNA differentiation between oceanic basins. Strong levels of structuring were also found at the regional level. In LFPW, phylogeographic patterns were suggestive either of a recent demographic expansion or selective sweep acting on the mtDNA. For SFPW, the waters around Japan appear to represent a centre of diversity, with two genetically-distinct forms, as well as a third population of unknown origin. The presence of multiple unique haplotypes among SFPW from South Japan, together with previously documented morphological and ecological differences, suggests that the southern form represents a distinct subspecies and/or evolutionary significant unit.

AB Niche theory is central to understanding how species respond geographically to climate change. It defines a species' realized niche in a biological community, its fundamental niche as determined by physiology, and its potential niche-the fundamental niche in a given environment or geographic space. However, most predictions of the effects of climate change on species' distributions are limited to correlative models of the realized niche, which assume that species are in distributional equilibrium with respect to the variables or gradients included in the model. Here, I present a mechanistic niche model that measures species' responses to major seasonal temperature gradients that interact with the physiology of the organism. I then use lethal physiological temperatures to parameterize the model for bird species in North and South America and show that most focal bird species are not in direct physiological equilibrium with the gradients. Results also show that most focal bird species possess broad thermal tolerances encompassing novel climates that could become available with climate change. I conclude with discussion of how mechanistic niche models may be used to (i) gain insights into the processes that cause species to respond to climate change and (ii) build more accurate correlative distribution models in birds and other species.

AB As climate change increasingly threatens biodiversity, identifying specific drivers of species loss as well as the attributes of species most vulnerable to climatic disturbances is a key challenge to ecologists and conservationists. Here we assess the effects of coral loss versus declines in structural complexity on obligate and facultative coral feeding butterflyfishes on coral reefs in the central and western Indian Ocean. In the inner Seychelles, the abundance of the obligate coral feeding group declined markedly in response to live coral mortality (r (2) = 0.48), but showed no further decline with respect to erosion of the physical matrix of the reef. Conversely, the facultative feeding group showed no decline in response to live coral loss, reflecting their feeding versatility; however they did decline in response to structural erosion of the reef framework (r (2) = 0.26). There were no significant changes in either obligate or facultative corallivore abundances at a reference location (Chagos archipelago), highlighting that butterflyfish populations are stable in the absence of habitat disturbance. While specialised coral dependant fishes are highly vulnerable to coral loss caused by climate-induced coral bleaching, the structural collapse of dead coral colonies may have significant, but more variable, impacts across a wide range of fishes. If conservation and mitigation planning are to be effective, there is a clear need to better understand the mechanisms of reef structural collapse and the dynamics of system recovery following large-scale disturbance.

AB 1. Relationships between the assemblage structure of stygobionts (i.e. obligate groundwater species) and habitat conditions in aquifers were explored in the French Jura based on 16 environmental variables and presence/absence data on stygobiotic species. The two data sets were simultaneously collected at a total of 269 sites.
   2. The study aimed to (i) identify the environmental factors determining the composition of stygobiotic assemblages at the regional scale; (ii) define the ecological preferences of the collected stygobiotic species along environmental gradients; and (iii) describe species assemblages occurring in similar habitats. These aims were pursued with a view to refine approaches to groundwater biodiversity assessment and sampling strategies.
   3. A large number of stygobionts (62 species) were collected using a stratified sampling design. The measured environmental variables explained 72% of the overall variability in stygobiotic assemblage structure. Determining factors were primarily geology (pore size) and dissolved oxygen concentration, and secondarily altitude and distance of sampling sites from areas glaciated during the Pleistocene. Water chemistry and land-cover variables had little influence on the composition of stygobiotic assemblages.
   4. Ecological preferences of stygobiotic species were bounded along environmental gradients using Outlying Mean Index (OMI) analysis. Apart from rare species (frequency < 0.01), most stygobionts had a tolerance index > 1, but residual tolerance observed in the most widespread species indicates sensitivity to other variables than those studied.
   5. Biodiversity hotspots mainly occurred in highly permeable geological formations such as karst and coarse alluvial environments with well oxygenated water situated between 200 and 500 m altitude. More intensive sampling of high-altitude sites is unlikely to yield additional species, but rare species may be found at low and mid altitudes and at sites far from the Wurm glaciers.

   Common carp (Cyprinus carpio L.) are a major freshwater invader and knowledge of their movements is important for planning control efforts. To investigate the movement patterns of common carp, radio-tags were implanted into 46 adult fish; 37 near a large floodplain wetland, the Barmah-Millewa forest, and 9 in the Murray River approximately 175 km upstream. Tagged fish were located every second week between August 1999 and March 2001. Common carp occupied total linear ranges (TLR) between 0.4 and 238 km (mean 30 +/- 61 km), with 25 fish (62.5%) occupying a TLR < 10 km. Two fish made large distance movements approximately 650 km downstream. Fish sex, the number of locations, time at large, or tagging location explained little variability (P > 0.05) in TLR. Monthly distance from release varied from 0.04 to 238 km (mean 15 +/- 44 km), and was not significantly related to river discharge and water temperature, but 29 of 31 (93.5%) fish tagged at Barmah moved from the Murray River into adjacent floodplain habitats upon flooding. Five fish (12.5%) moved large distances (> 127 km) upstream of the Barmah-Millewa forest. Fourteen fish (35%) showed site fidelity to within 20 m and usually occupied one or two home sites. Twenty-six fish (65%) showed site fidelity to within 100 m occupying up to five sites during the study period. Movement patterns of common carp were complex, and individuals exhibited different strategies, which is typical of invasive species. Efforts to control and potentially reduce common carp populations in regulated river-floodplain environments should target key floodplain access points and over-wintering habitats to reduce adult biomass, spawning and recruitment levels.

AB Both human-related and natural factors can affect the establishment and distribution of exotic species. Understanding the relative role of the different factors has important scientific and applied implications. Here, we examined the relative effect of human-related and natural factors in determining the richness of exotic bird species established across Europe. Using hierarchical partitioning, which controls for covariation among factors, we show that the most important factor is the human-related community-level propagule pressure (the number of exotic species introduced), which is often not included in invasion studies due to the lack of information for this early stage in the invasion process. Another, though less important, factor was the human footprint (an index that includes human population size, land use and infrastructure). Biotic and abiotic factors of the environment were of minor importance in shaping the number of established birds when tested at a European extent using 50 x 50 km(2) grid squares. We provide, to our knowledge, the first map of the distribution of exotic bird richness in Europe. The richest hotspot of established exotic birds is located in southeastern England, followed by areas in Belgium and The Netherlands. Community-level propagule pressure remains the major factor shaping the distribution of exotic birds also when tested for the UK separately. Thus, studies examining the patterns of establishment should aim at collecting the crucial and hard-to-find information on community-level propagule pressure or develop reliable surrogates for estimating this factor. Allowing future introductions of exotic birds into Europe should be reconsidered carefully, as the number of introduced species is basically the main factor that determines the number established.

AB Uniparental reproduction has often been regarded as advantageous for colonization. In pseudogamous apomicts, reproduction via single individuals requires self-pollination and consequently self-compatibility (SC) for production of viable seeds. SC and reproductive fitness have been studied in diploid and polyploid taxa of the Ranunculus auricomus complex via pollinator exclusion tests, assessment of seed set, and germination rates. Reproductive fitness of sexuals exceeds that of apomicts and of F-1 hybrids but may fluctuate more strongly between years than is the case in apomicts. Diploid sexual taxa and also their F-1 hybrids are completely self-incompatible (SI). Autopolyploid sexual cytotypes are also predominantly SI, which may have restricted their range expansion. The observed breakdown of SI in the rather widespread allohexaploid apomicts may be explained by initial partial SC inherited from semi-self-compatible ancestors and strong selection for SC genotypes. It is concluded that higher reproductive fitness of sexuals may help to maintain sexual populations when cross-pollination is available, whereas SC in apomicts may be advantageous in temporally and spatially unstable environments and also for colonization events. Results suggest that SC in connection with pseudogamous apomixis is an important factor for the observed distribution pattern of geographical parthenogenesis.

AB In this study we aimed to combine knowledge of the ecophysiology and genetics of European beech to assess the potential of this species to adapt to environmental change. Therefore, we performed field and experimental studies on the genetic and ecophysiological functioning of beech. This information was integrated through a coupled genetic-ecophysiological model for individual trees that was parameterized with information derived from our own studies or from the literature. Using the model, we evaluated the adaptive response of beech stands in two ways: firstly, through sensitivity analyses (of initial genetic diversity, pollen dispersal distance, heritability of selected phenotypic traits, and forest management, representing disturbances) and secondly, through the evaluation of the responses of phenotypic traits and their genetic diversity to four management regimes applied to 10 study plots distributed over Western Europe. The model results indicate that the interval between recruitment events strongly affects the rate of adaptive response, because selection is most severe during the early stages of forest development. Forest management regimes largely deter-mine recruitment intervals and thereby the potential for adaptive responses. Forest management regimes also determine the number of mother trees that contribute to the next generation and thereby the genetic variation that is maintained. Consequently, undisturbed forests maintain the largest amount of genetic variation, as recruitment intervals approach the longevity of trees and many mother trees contribute to the next generation. However, undisturbed forests have the slowest adaptive response, for the same reasons.
   Gene flow through pollen dispersal may compensate for the loss in genetic diversity brought about by selection. The sensitivity analysis showed that the total genetic diversity of a 2 ha stand is not affected by gene flow if the pollen distance distribution is varied from highly left-skewed to almost flat. However, a stand with a prevailing short-distance gene flow has a more pronounced spatial genetic structure than stands with equal short- and long-distance gene flows. The build-up of a spatial genetic structure is also strongly determined by the recruitment interval. Overall, the modelling results indicate that European beech has high adaptive potential to environmental change if recruitment intervals are short and many mother trees contribute to the next generation.
   The findings have two implications for modelling studies on the impacts of climate change on forests. Firstly: it cannot be taken for granted that parameter values remain constant over a time horizon of even a few generations - this is particularly important for threshold values subject to strong selection, like budburst, frost hardiness, drought tolerance, as used in species area models. Secondly: forest management should be taken into account in future assessments, as management affects the rate of adaptive response and thereby the response on trees and forests to environmental change, and because few forests are unmanaged. We conclude that a coupled ecophysiological and quantitative genetic tree model is a useful tool for such studies. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Current United States National Park Service (NPS) management is challenged to balance visitor use with the environmental and social consequences of automobile use. Wildlife populations in national parks are increasingly vulnerable to road impacts. Other than isolated reports on the incidence of road-related mortality, there is little knowledge of how roads might affect wildlife populations throughout the national park system. Researchers at the Western Transportation Institute synthesized information obtained from a system-wide survey of resource managers to assess the magnitude of their concerns on the impacts of roads on park wildlife. The results characterize current conditions and help identify wildlife-transportation conflicts. A total of 196 national park management units (NPS units) were contacted and 106 responded to our questionnaire. Park resource managers responded that over half of the NPS units' existing transportation systems were at or above capacity, with traffic volumes currently high or very high in one quarter of them and traffic expected to increase in the majority of units. Data is not generally collected systematically on road-related mortality to wildlife, yet nearly half of the respondents believed road-caused mortality significantly affected wildlife populations. Over one-half believed habitat fragmentation was affecting wildlife populations. Despite these expressed concerns, only 36% of the NPS units used some form of mitigation method to reduce road impacts on wildlife. Nearly half of the respondents expect that these impacts would only worsen in the next five years. Our results underscore the importance for a more systematic approach to address wildlife-roadway conflicts for a situation that is expected to increase in the next five to ten years.

AB Recent work has confirmed that genetic compatibility among mates can be an important determinant of siring success in sperm competition experiments and in free-ranging populations. Most of this work points towards mate choice of less related mates. However, there may also be the potential for mate choice for intermediate or even genetically similar mates to prevent outbreeding depression or hybridization with closely related taxa. We studied relatedness effects on post-copulatory gametic choice and/or sperm competition in an external fertilizer, Peron's tree frog (Litoria peronii), since external fertilizers offer exceptional control in order to test gametic interaction effects on probability of paternity and zygote viability. Sperm competition experiments were done blindly with respect to genetic relatedness among males and females. Thereafter, paternity of offspring was assigned using eight microsatellite loci. Three hybridization trials between L. peronii and a closely related sympatric species Litoria tyleri were also carried out. In the sperm competition trials, males that are more genetically similar to the female achieved higher siring success compared with less genetically similar males. The hybridization trials confirmed that the two species can interbreed and we suggest that the risk of hybridization may contribute to selection benefits for genetically more similar males at fertilization. To our knowledge, this study is the first to show evidence for post-copulatory selection of sperm from genetically more similar individuals within a natural population.

AB Disturbed habitats are often swiftly colonized by alien plant species. Human inhabited areas may act as sources from which such aliens disperse, while road verges have been suggested as corridors facilitating their dispersal. We therefore hypothesized that (i) houses and urban areas are propagule sources from which aliens disperse, and that (ii) road verges act as corridors for their dispersal. We sampled presence and cover of aliens in 20 plots (6 x 25 m) per road at 5-km intervals for four roads, nested within three localities around cities (n = 240). Plots consisted of three adjacent nested transects. Houses (n = 3,349) were mapped within a 5-km radius from plots using topographical maps. Environmental processes as predictors of alien composition differed across spatial levels. At the broadest scale road-surface type, soil type, and competition from indigenous plants were the strongest predictors of alien composition. Within localities disturbance-related variables such as distance from dwellings and urban areas were associated with alien composition, but their effect differed between localities. Within roads, density and proximity of houses was related to higher alien species richness. Plot distance from urban areas, however, was not a significant predictor of alien richness or cover at any of the spatial levels, refuting the corridor hypothesis. Verges hosted but did not facilitate the spread of alien species. The scale dependence and multiplicity of mechanisms explaining alien plant communities found here highlight the importance of considering regional climatic gradients, landscape context and road-verge properties themselves when managing verges.

AB There is an urgent and immediate need to address the excessive cost of large fires. Here, we studied large wildland fire suppression expenditures by the US Department of Agriculture Forest Service. Among 16 potential nonmanagerial factors, which represented fire size and shape, private properties, public land attributes, forest and fuel conditions, and geographic settings, we found only fire size and private land had a strong effect on suppression expenditures. When both were accounted for, all the other variables had no significant effect. A parsimonious model to predict suppression expenditures was suggested, in which fire size and private land explained 58% of variation in expenditures. Other things being equal, suppression expenditures monotonically increased with fire size. For the average fire size, expenditures first increased with the percentage of private land within burned area, but as the percentage exceeded 20%, expenditures slowly declined until they stabilised when private land reached 50% of burned area. The results suggested that efforts to contain federal suppression expenditures need to focus on the highly complex, politically sensitive topic of wildfires on private land.

AB The rarity of parthenogenesis, reproduction without sex, is a major evolutionary puzzle. To understand why sexual genetic systems are so successful in nature, we must understand why parthenogenesis sometimes evolves and persists. Here we use DNA sequence data to test for similarities in the tempo and mode of the evolution of parthenogenesis in a grasshopper and a lizard from the Australian desert. We find spectacular congruence between genetic and geographic patterns of parthenogenesis in these distantly related organisms. In each species, parthenogenesis evolved twice and appears to have expanded in parallel waves across the desert, suggesting a highly general selective force against sex.

AB Leptodactylus fuscus is a neotropical frog ranging from Panama to Argentina, to the east of the Andes mountains, and also inhabiting Margarita, Trinidad, and the Tobago islands. We performed phylogenetic analyses of 12S rRNA, 16S rRNA, tRNA-Leu, and ND1 mitochondrial (mt) DNA sequences from specimens collected across the geographic distribution of L. fuscus to examine two alternative hypotheses: (i) L. fuscus is a single, widely distributed species, or (ii) L. fuscus is a species complex. We tested statistically for geographic association and partitioning of genetic variation among mtDNA clades. The mtDNA data supported the hypothesis of several cryptic species within L. fuscus. Unlinked mtDNA and nuclear markers supported independently the distinctness of a 'northern' phylogenetic unit. In addition, the mtDNA data divided the southern populations into two clades that showed no sister relationship to each other, consistent with high differentiation and lack of gene flow among southern populations as suggested by allozyme data. Concordance between mtDNA and allozyme patterns suggests that cryptic speciation has occurred in L. fuscus without morphological or call differentiation. This study illustrates a case in which lineage splitting during the speciation process took place without divergence in reproductive isolation mechanisms (e.g. advertisement call in frogs), contrary to expectations predicted using a biological species framework.

AB We examined whether highway traffic volume changed the rates of movement (habitat permeability) for ten mammalian species in the central Canadian Rocky Mountains. Winter track count data were collected on four highways of varying traffic volume: the Trans-Canada Highway (TCH) (74,000 annual average daily traffic [AADT]) and 1A Highway (3,000 AADT) in Banff National Park and the Highway 40 (5,000 AADT) and Smith Dorrien Trail in Kananaskis Country (2,000 AADT). Permeability represented the ratio of road crossing tracks/km to tracks/km on transects adjacent to roads. We compared permeability at the community level and for carnivore and ungulate guilds, using a Kruskal-Wallis H-test. Traffic volume significantly reduced habitat permeability for the community (P 0.05). Pair-wise Kruskal-Wallis tests showed that habitat permeability was significantly reduced for carnivores at high traffic volume (P 0.008) and for ungulates at very high traffic volume (P 0.043). Cross-referencing with winter traffic counts, we found movement was impaired for carnivores when traffic ranged from 300 to 500 vehicles per day (VPD) and for ungulates between 500 and 5,000 VPD. Our results indicated that the TCH requires mitigation to restore habitat permeability for all species and yielded strong evidence that the Highway 40 is a priority for mitigation.

AB The present study was performed to investigate the adjustment of the rate parameters of the light and dark reactions of photosynthesis to the natural growth light in leaves of an overstorey species, Betula pendula Roth, a subcanopy species, Tilia cordata P. Mill., and a herb, Solidago virgaurea L., growing in a natural plant community in Jarvselja, Estonia. Shoots were collected from the site and individual leaves were measured in a laboratory applying a standardized routine of kinetic gas exchange, Chl fluorescence and 820 nm transmittance measurements. These measurements enabled the calculations of the quantum yield of photosynthesis and rate constants of excitation capture by photochemical and non-photochemical quenchers, rate constant for P700(+) reduction via the cytochrome b(6)f complex with and without photosynthetic control, actual maximum and potential (uncoupled) electron transport rate, stomatal and mesophyll resistances for CO2 transport, K-m(CO2) and V-m of ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase (Rubisco) in vivo. In parallel, N, Chl and Rubisco contents were measured from the same leaves. No adjustment toward higher quantum yield in shade compared with sun leaves was observed, although relatively more N was partitioned to the light-harvesting machinery in shade leaves (H. Eichelmann et al., 2004). The electron transport rate through the Cyt b(6)f complex was strongly down-regulated under saturating light compared with darkness, and this was observed under atmospheric, as well as saturating CO2 concentration. In vivo V-m measurements of Rubisco were lower than corresponding reported measurements in vitro, and the k(cat) per reaction site varied widely between leaves and growth sites. The correlation between Rubisco V-m and the photosystem I density was stronger than between V-m and the density of Rubisco active sites. The results showed that the capacity of the photosynthetic machinery decreases in shade-adjusted leaves, but it still remains in excess of the actual photosynthetic rate. The photosynthetic control systems that are targeted to adjust the photosynthetic rate to meet the plant's needs and to balance the partial reactions of photosynthesis, down-regulate partial processes of photosynthesis: excess harvested light is quenched non-photochemically; excess electron transport capacity of Cyt b(6)f is down-regulated by DeltapH-dependent photosynthetic control; Rubisco is synthesized in excess, and the number of activated Rubisco molecules is controlled by photosystem I-related processes. Consequently, the nitrogen contained in the components of the photosynthetic machinery is not used at full efficiency. The strong correlation between leaf nitrogen and photosynthetic performance is not due to the nitrogen requirements of the photosynthetic apparatus, but because a certain amount of energy must be captured through photosynthesis to maintain this nitrogen within a leaf.

Gaertn. in combination with gas exchange and carbon isotopic composition to estimate leaf water-use efficiency (WUE) and potential nitrogen-use efficiency (NUE). NaCl was not added to the control plants and the others were maintained at salinities of 15 and 30 parts per thousand (S-0, S-15, and S-30, respectively). Leaf succulence, sodium (Na), nitrogen (N), and chlorophyll (Chl) contents increased under salinity. Salinity had a negative impact on net photosynthetic rate P-N) and stomatal conductance (g(s)) at high and moderated irradiances. Potential NUE declined significantly (p<0.05) with salinity by 37 and 58 % at S-15 and S-30, respectively, compared to S-0 plants. Conversely, compared to S-0 plants, P-N/g(s) increased under saline conditions by 12% (S-15) and 50 % (S-30). Thus, VXE inferred from P-N/g(s) was consistent with salinity improved short-term WUE. Long-term leaf WUE was also enhanced by salinity as suggested by significantly increased leaf delta C-13 with salinity. Improved WUE under salinity explains the eco-physiological success of mangrove species under increasing salinity. Conversely, decline in NUE may pose a problem for L. racemosa under hyper-saline environments regardless of N availability.

AB Understanding the thermal physiology of tropical marine organisms has become an issue of major interest due to the potential impact of current global changes in temperature. In this study we report the effect of body size on the thermal tolerance ( as critical thermal maximum (CTMax) and minimum (CTMin)) of seven reef fish species from Gorgona Island ( tropical eastern Pacific Ocean). Within the studied species we found little variation in CTMax and CTMin among fishes ranging from juveniles to adults. This suggests that thermal tolerance of small tropical reef fishes is not significantly affected by differences in body size. The reduced intra-specific variation in thermal tolerance found in these species also suggests a limited capability to adapt to extreme thermal conditions and raises concerns regarding current global changes in temperature.

AB Here we examined correlations between needle nitrogen concentration ([N]) and photosynthetic responses of Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) seedlings to growth in elevated temperatures and atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations ([CO2]).
   Seedlings were grown in sunlit, climate-controlled chambers at ambient or ambient +3.5degreesC and ambient or ambient +180 mumol mol(-1) CO2 in a full factorial design. Photosynthetic parameters and needle [N] were measured six times over a 21-month period.
   Needle [N] varied seasonally, and accounted for 30-50% of the variation in photosynthetic parameters. Across measurement periods, elevated temperature increased needle [N] by 26% and light-saturated net photosynthetic rates by 17%. Elevated [CO2] decreased needle [N] by 12%, and reduced net photosynthetic rates measured at a common [CO2], maximum carboxylation activity (V-c,V-max) and electron transport capacity (J(max)), indicating photosynthetic acclimatization. Even so, elevated [CO2] enhanced net photosynthesis, and this effect increased with needle (N].
   These results suggest that needle [N] may regulate photosynthetic responses of Douglas-fir to climate change. Further, needle [N] may be altered by climate change. However, effects of elevated [CO2] on photosynthesis. may be similar across growth temperatures.

AB Methane (CH4) effluxes by paddy-culture rice (Oryza sativa L.) contribute about 16% of the total anthropogenic emissions. Since radiative forcing of CH4 at current atmospheric concentrations is 21 times greater on a per mole basis than that of carbon dioxide (CO2), it is imperative that the impact of global change on rice CH4 emissions be evaluated. Rice (cv. IR72) was planted in sunlit, closed-circulation, controlled-environment chambers in which CH4 efflux densities were measured daily. The CO2 concentration was maintained at either 330 or 660 mumol mol(-1). Air temperatures were controlled to daily maxima and minima of 32123, 35/26, and 38/29degreesC at each CO2 treatment. Emissions of CH4 each day were determined during a 4-h period after venting and resealing the chambers at 0800 h. Diurnal CH4 effluxes on 77, 98, and 119 d after planting (DAP) were obtained similarly at 4-h intervals. Emissions over four-plant hills and over flooded bare soil were measured at 53,63, and 100 DAP. Emissions were negligible before 40 DAP. Thereafter, emissions were observed first in high-CO2, high-temperature treatments and reached a sustained maximum efflux density of about 7 mg m(-2) h(-1) (0.17 g m(-2) d(-1)) near the end of the growing season. Total seasonal CH4 emission was fourfold greater for high-CO2, high-temperature treatments than for the low-CO2, low-temperature treatment, probably due to more root sloughing or exudates, since about sixfold more acetate was found in the soil at 71 DAP. Both rising CO2 and increasing temperatures could lead to a positive feedback on global warming by increasing the emissions of CH4 from rice.

AB Integrated synusial phytosociology combined with traditional measures of diversity is used to describe the structure of vascular vegetation diversity along the forested riparian landscape of the upper Oise valley (Belgium and France). The two dimensions (longitudinal and lateral) of the geomorphological complex are examined at four scales: synusia, phytocoenosis, tesela and catena. The results support the following hypotheses: (1) the environmental gradients observed, particularly the lateral ones, are very complex; (2) there is a clear lack of coupling between the tree, shrub and herb layers, which indicates a differential response to the underlying influence of environmental controls; (3) moderate flooding-induced disturbance enhances herb species richness; (4) stressful environments support a low plant species diversity but a high synusial richness; (5) natural factors (substrate, climate, disturbance) are more important at the synusia and phytocoenose scales, but (6) anthropogenic disturbances, mainly through forest and river management, are more important at the landscape level. By considering plant communities as structural-dynamic entities of ecosystems in a landscape context, integrated synusial phytosociology provides a basis for decomposing a complex system since the different hierarchical levels are both nested and thus strongly relational and process-based.

AB Iris haynei and I. atrofusca are two closely related narrow endemics distributed vicariously along an ecogeographical north-south gradient in Israel and the West Bank. To obtain baseline information of the taxonomic status, conservation and population history of these taxa, we investigated patterns of phenotypic variation and the partitioning of genetic variation within and among populations using dominant random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers. Multivariate (principal components analysis) and taxonomic distance analyses based on morphometric traits from eight populations revealed no unambiguous separation into two distinct groups. Results of genetic analyses for nine populations differed only slightly when either allele- or marker-based approaches were employed. Mean within-population diversity was high (0.258 for Nei's expected heterozygosity), but there was no significant relationship between genetic diversity and either population size or latitude. Although the range-wide estimate of G(ST) (approximate to0.20) revealed relatively high differentiation among populations this value was inflated because of a small, but significant, component of molecular variance among regions viz. taxa (approximate to5%). Limited long-distance dispersal capabilities in conjunction with a linearized habitat distribution are proposed to contribute to the approximate isolation by distance pattern observed. It also appears that extant populations are currently deviating from equilibrium conditions because of primary divergence of a formerly more widespread ancestral population. Given the absence of deep genetic and phenotypic subdivision among northern (I. haynei) vs. central/southern (I. atrofusca) populations, we argue for a revision of their species status. Nonetheless, we recommend conservation attention to these geographically differentiated segments as separate management units, which can be seen as an instructive example of incipient species formation.

AB We examined growth of recently settled juvenile red drum in salt marsh, seagrass, oyster reef, and on nonvegetated bottom areas in the Galveston Bay system of Texas (USA). We estimated growth using otolith microstructure from free-ranging fish collected in different habitat types and also measured growth of red drum in experimental enclosures where fish movement was restricted. Otolith growth was closely related to somatic growth in fish of 13 to 33 mm SL, and we used daily otolith increments from the last 10 d before capture as an indicator of growth following settlement into estuarine habitats. Growth rates of red drum captured at marsh, nonvegetated, and seagrass sites were not significantly different; no fish were collected on oyster reef. While reducing potential problems of a lagged response between otolith growth and somatic growth, the use of a 10 d growth period may have increased the likelihood of fish movement among habitats affecting our comparisons. The overall post-settlement growth rate of 0.45 mm d(-1) was similar to rates reported in the literature. Movement among habitat types was eliminated in experiments employing 24 solid-walled enclosures (60 cm diameter). Growth rates in enclosures over the 7 d experiment were 0.12 mm d(-1) in oyster reef, 0.21 mm d(-1) on nonvegetated bottom, 0.40 mm d(-1) in salt marsh, and 0.42 mm d(-1) in seagrass; rates in vegetated enclosures approximated natural growth rates. Significantly higher growth in marsh and seagrass enclosures suggests that growth potential for red drum may be highest in these vegetated areas. However, growth results in enclosures need to be evaluated carefully, because fish movement among habitat types may be important in these shallow estuarine systems.

AB Acid phosphatase activity (APA), labile P fractions and fine root growth were studied in an oak (Quercus pyrenaica Willd.) forest in the Sierra de Gata, in western central Spain. Soils in the region are acid and rich in organic matter, with low levels of extractable inorganic P but with a high proportion of organic P In such soils, the activity of phosphatase enzymes is likely to be important for the control of P mineralization and P cycling and, consequently, can affect the availability of P for plant uptake. The biomass of fine roots was about 25-fold that of leaf litter, demonstrating a high allocation of C resources to the root system in order to compensate for a low availability of soil nutrients. The study compared plots fertilized with triple superphosphate (100 kg P ha(-1)) to control (unfertilized) plots. Fertilizer application had no significant effect on APA and fine root density; however, there were significant differences in available and microbial P. Spatial and seasonal variations in the APA were related to plant root density and biotic demand. Seasonal differences in the APA may also be the consequence of changes in the amount of hydrolysable organic substrates at different times of the year.

AB Synechococcus was more abundant and had a greater biomass than Prochlorococcus at most inshore and mid-shelf sites in the central (17 degreesS) Great Barrier Reef (GBR), and at all shelf sites in the southern (20 degreesS) GBR. Significant Prochlorococcus populations were confined to mid- and outer-shelf sites with mixed or partially stratified water columns of greater oceanic character in the central GBR, where depth-weighted average Synechococcus and Prochlorococcus abundances were better correlated with salinity, shelf depth and chlorophyll a concentration, than with concentrations of NH4+, NOx- (i.e. NO2 + NO3-), or PO43-. Vertical gradients of normalized mean cellular red and orange fluorescence of Synechococcus and Prochlorococcus populations imply that vertical mixing rates were sufficiently low to allow these populations to photoacclimate at depth at shelf locations in the central GBR, but too great for substantial photoacclimation to be observed at sites in the southern GBR. The presence of Prochlorococcus populations at inshore sites in the central GBR in the absence of extensive intrusion events suggests that Prochlorococcus populations were actively, growing.

AB The ingrowth core method can be used to measure root gross growth (i.e. root production). A mesh bag filled with root free soil is buried into the root zone. After about 14 days, the bag is pulled out and root length inside the core can be determined. An objection against this method is the inability to obtain the same soil conditions inside the bag as outside, which can result in different root growth pattern in the ingrowth core compared to the bulk soil. To study this, mesh bags were buried in a stand of oilseed rape and were filled with soil at different nitrate, phosphate, moisture, and bulk density levels. Results showed that root growth was only influenced by a high nitrate content and a high soil density in the coes, which resulted in higher and lower root length densities (RLD), respectively. In a long-term ingrowth experiment similar root length densities in the cores and in the bulk soil were measured, indicating that there were no root growth enhancing or impeding conditions inside the ingrowth cores. The conclusion is drawn, that the ingrowth core method gives reliable results, provided the N content and the soil density inside the bags are to the bulk soil.

AB There appears to be widespread acceptance that for a population to persist, some demographic parameter must be density dependent at some place or time. In this paper, we question the veracity and heuristic value of treating this statement as a general principle of ecology. We also point out that some processes that have recently been defined as density dependent are, in fact, not. Taken in its original sense, density dependence implies a change in demographic rates based on biological (generally negative) feedback. Situations exist, however, in which demographic rates change in relation to density without negative biological feedback. For example, per capita recruitment in marine populations will decrease as local population size increases even as absolute numbers of arriving larvae do not change. The failure to separate these density-related processes from true density-dependent processes affects our understanding of population regulation and of the way in which the natural world functions. Furthermore, focusing solely on density-dependent processes and their role in population regulation neglects to address numerous density-independent processes like disturbance and climatic variation that may have important impacts in determining population size.

ID LINE-INTERCEPT METHODS; LENGTH
AB Measurement of relatively small (<100 m total length, <6 g fresh wt.) root systems has been simplified by image analysis, but measuring larger root systems remains time-consuming and inaccurate. Reliability of root estimation can be improved through identification of effective sampling methods. We devised a system for the collection of homogeneous root subsamples by air-stirring in water. We optimized the subsampling technique and used a scanner-based image analysis system to measure total root length, mean root diameter, and root surface area of three maize (Zea mays L.) genotypes with contrasting root morphologies: leafy reduced stature (LRS), leafy normal stature (LNS), and Pioneer 3905 (P3905), a commercial hybrid. Root length was determined for 957 subsamples. Confidence intervals were generated by software using the bootstrap resampling approach for optimizing sample size. Confidence intervals for mean estimates of each sample size were defined by ordering the evaluation function values from the smallest to the largest in a set of 5000 iterations. The lower and upper bounds of confidence intervals were also calculated using the standard procedure. This system allowed collection of homogeneous subsamples. Calculations showed that similar to 10% of total root volume should be analyzed for estimation of the entire root system to be accurate within 10%. Although unreplicated, these data suggest that maize genotypes with the leafy trait have greater root lengths (1.75 km for LRS, 2.37 km for LNS, and 0.49 km for conventional commercial hybrid P3905) and a greater proportion of fine roots than the nonleafy type.

AB The sequence evolution of the nuclear gene wingless was investigated among 34 representatives of three lepidopteran families (Riodinidae, Lycaenidae, and Nymphalidae) and four outgroups, and its utility for inferring phylogenetic relationships among these taxa was assessed. Parsimony analysis yielded a well-resolved topology supporting the monophyly of the Riodinidae and Lycaenidae, respectively, and indicating that these two groups are sister lineages, with strong nodal support based on bootstrap and decay indices. Although, wingless provides robust support for relationships within and between the riodinids and the lycaenids, it is less informative about nymphalid relationships. Wingless does not consistently recover nymphalid monophyly or traditional subfamilial relationships within the nymphalids, and nodal support for all but the most recent branches in this family is low. Much of the phylogenetic information in this data set is derived from first- and second-position substitutions. However third positions, despite showing uncorrected pairwise divergences up to 78%, also contain consistent signal at deep nodes within the family Riodinidae and at the node defining the sister relationship between the riodinids and lycaenids. Several hypotheses about how third-position signal has been retained in deep nodes are discussed. These include among-site rate variation, identified as a significant factor by maximum likelihood analyses, and nucleotide bias, a prominent feature of third positions in this data set. Understanding the mechanisms which underlie third-position signal is a first step in applying appropriate models to accommodate the specific evolutionary processes involved in each lineage.

AB Mating systems and sexual selection are assumed to be affected by the distribution of critical resources. We use observations of 312 mating aggregations to compare mate-searching success of male northern water snakes (Nerodia sipedon) in two marshes in which differences in mating substrate availability resulted in more than fourfold differences in female dispersion. Reproductive males had significantly larger home ranges where females were dispersed than where females were clumped. The number of females encountered by males increased significantly with male home range size where females were dispersed, and decreased significantly where females were clumped. Where females were clumped, males were more likely to encounter Other males when they located females. We found no evidence in either population that mate searching was energetically expensive or that males with relatively more energy had larger home ranges. However, males with greater fat reserves at the start of the season participated in more mating aggregations when females were dispersed, suggesting that fat reserves could affect a male's willingness to attempt mating or to persist in aggregations. When females were dispersed there was weak stabilizing selection acting to maintain male body size (beta=-0.14), but strong directional selection favoring larger (beta=0.50) and fatter (beta=0.37) males. Over 7 years, the intensity of selection favoring larger males varied substantially (beta=0.14-1.15), but that variation was not related to variation in the operational sex ratio. We found no evidence of directional selection on either body size (beta=0.05) or fat reserves (beta=0.10) of males when females were spatially clumped. Overall, the distribution of females had a pronounced effect on male behavior, on the factors that affected male success in locating females, and probably on the extent of sperm competition once females had been located.

AB The aim of the study was to measure hyphal P uptake by native arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi using a test system designed for field conditions. Phosphorus uptake by external hyphae of a native arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungal community was studied in the winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L, ev. Stava) crop of an organic cropping rotation. Mesh containers containing a soil of volume accessible only to external hyphae were buried in the ground. The soil inside these hyphal compartments (HCs) was labeled with P-32 to distinguish P taken up from inside the HCs from overall P uptake. As an additional control treatment, half of the HCs received the fungicide carbendazim [methyl benzimidazol 2-y carbamate] at a rate known to disrupt AM hyphal P uptake. Wheat tillers were harvested throughout the experimental period to monitor the time course of hyphal P uptake. final harvest was at plant maturity, at which time the HCs a ere excavated and the soil inside was analyzed for hyphal length, NaHCO3-extractable P and specific activity of the extracted P. External hyphae of the native AM fungi grew into the HCs without added carbendazim and took up substantial amounts of P. Addition of carbendazim at a rate known to inhibit hyphal P uptake resulted in no P uptake from inside those HCs. This is due to the design of the HCs used in this study, which successfully prevented P uptake by plant roots and root hairs from inside the HCs. The HCs are therefore well suited for field measurements of plant P uptake,ia external hyphae of the native MI fungi. Estimates for length-specific hyphal P uptake per unit time (37.8 +/- 5.2 fmol P m(-1) s(-1)) were similar to published estimates obtained in growth chamber studies with cultured isolates of AM fungi (1-430 fmol P m(-1) s(-1)). The results of this study demonstrate the considerable contribution of native Mi fungi to overall P uptake of field-grown winter wheat, even at typical field soil fertility levels (28 mu g NaHCO3-extractable P g(-1) soil).

AB Population genetic structure and the mating system were investigated in the endangered plant Lambertia orbifolia. This species is geographically restricted with two disjunct groups of populations. Twelve out of 19 allozyme loci were polymorphic and four were suitable for mating system studies. Levels of genetic variation within populations were comparable to other long-lived woody shrub endemics. Genetic divergence between population groups was very high (D = 0.252) and the F-ST over all populations was 0.441. Gene flow estimates within population groups were low even though the maximum geographical distance between any pair of populations is 15 km and could be attributed to the localized movement of bird pollinators. Mating system studies on four populations showed consistently low levels of outcrossing, compared with other Proteaceae. Correlations of outcrossed paternity were moderately high and all were significantly greater than zero. Values ranged from r(p) = 0.33, in the two largest and very dense populations, to the highest value of r(p) = 0.51 in a smaller low-density population. The current population genetic structure in L. orbifolia is probably the result of local extinction of intervening populations because of Pleistocene climatic change and increased aridity, and extended isolation of the two remnants. It is proposed that the phylogenetically distinct Narrikup population group be recognized as a separate conservation unit and be given high priority for conservation action.

AB Phylogenetic analyses of gene and protein sequences have led to two major competing views of the universal phylogeny, the evolutionary tree relating the three kinds of living organisms, Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya. In the first scheme, called "the archaebacterial tree," organisms of the same type are clustered together. In the second scenario, called "the eocyte tree," the archaeal phylum of Crenarchaeota is more closely related to eukaryotes than are other Archaea. A major property of the evolution of functional ribosomal and protein-encoding genes is that the rate of nucleotide and amino acid substitution varies across sequence sites. Here, using distance-based and maximum-likelihood methods, we show that universal phylogenies of ribosomal RNAs and RNA polymerases built by ignoring this variation are biased toward the archaebacterial tree because of attraction between long branches. In contrast, taking among-site rate variability into account gives support for the eocyte tree. (C) 1999 Academic Press.

AB A portion of the mitochondrial control region (494 bp) was sequenced in 106 great reed between populations in northern and western Europe whereas the sample from Greece differed significantly from the other European breeding populations. The lowest haplotype diversity was found near the distribution range limit in Sweden and in The Netherlands suggesting recent effects of bottlenecks/founder events in these areas. A neighbour-joining analysis of the different haplotypes placed the haplotypes into two distinctive clades, A and B. The divergence of the two clades was on average 1.29%. Accounting for the within clade variation suggested a divergence time between these lines approximately 70 000 years BP. The frequency of the two clades changed longitudinally across Europe with the A haplotype in the west and the B haplotype in the east. All birds from Kenya carried the B haplotype suggesting an origin of these birds east of Latvia/Greece. The long-term female effective population size was estimated to be 20 000 individuals, which is approximately 2% of current population size. (C) 1999 The Linnean Society of London.

AB The pupfishes of Death Valley (genus: Cyprinodon) are a classic example of rapid (post-Pleistocene) allopatric divergence with several populations exhibiting striking morphological, physiological, and behavioural differences. However, genetic changes accompanying or causing this divergence have been poorly resolved and/or difficult to detect. In order to investigate the phylogeography of the system and infer historical effective population sizes, mtDNA sequence variation was assessed within and among populations. In total, mtDNA D-loop sequences revealed 11 haplotypes among 278 individuals from 16 populations. Genetic diversity within populations was generally low (1-3 haplotypes per population) suggesting relatively small effective population sizes. Most variation occurred among populations, resulting in extensive genetic structure. The genealogical relationships of mtDNA haplotypes were determined by a combined phylogenetic analysis of both D-loop and ND2 sequences. These relationships revealed that the present distribution of haplotypes in Death Valley has probably resulted from stochastic, and in some cases, incomplete sorting of ancestral variation. The presence of highly diver gent haplotypes in some populations may indicate that ancestral population sizes were substantially larger, perhaps rivalling population sizes observed in contemporary coastal pupfish species. In contrast, other Death Valley populations of equal contemporary size appeared monomorphic suggesting historical genetic bottleneck events. The Death Valley pupfishes provide an important example of the limitations inherent in defining evolutionarily significant units (ESUs) for conservation purposes based on mtDNA sequence variation alone.

AB A combination of direct (mark-resight) and indirect genetic methods were used to investigate natal dispersal patterns and genetic population structure in a population of North American pikas, Ochotona princeps. Pikas are small lagomorphs found in talus habitat of alpine areas throughout western North America. Adult pikas are individually territorial and rarely disperse. I used multilocus DNA fingerprinting to identify the parents of juvenile animals. The settlement pattern of marked juveniles and the pattern of relatedness of pikas across the study site was then examined within the study area. Although juveniles born at the study site exhibited a philopatric settlement pattern, an isolation-by-distance analysis did not reveal clusters of highly related individuals within the population. The F-ST estimate suggests little genetic differentiation between populations 2 km apart, and average DNA fingerprinting band-sharing among adults was similar to values reported for outbred species. An average of 34% of the adult population was replaced each winter by immigrants. DNA fingerprinting band-sharing analysis suggests that these immigrants had dispersed short, intermediate, and long distances. These findings differ from earlier studies which used observations of marked animals only to characterize dispersal patterns. Direct observations of marked juveniles had documented a philopatric settlement pattern, little or no dispersal out of natal populations, and no direct evidence of long distance movement. Of the three major hypotheses proposed to explain the evolution of dispersal in birds and mammals, competition for resources, competition for mates, and inbreeding avoidance, the results of this study support a competition for resources hypothesis, where the key resource is territory.

AB Soil solution was obtained from potted rhizosphere or non-rhizosphere soils by water displacement or soil centrifugation. The pH of the displaced solutions was lower than that of bulk soils when solutions were obtained from non-rhizosphere soil, although it increased as plants grew. This increase probably reflected true changes in rhizosphere pH, generated by the uptake by plants of NO3-N. In contrast, the pH of soil centrifugates was usually close to that of the bulk soils, implying that buffering by colloids had occurred during sampling. Concentrations of elements in solutions from non-rhizosphere soil were similar for both methods when soils were incubated at ambient pCO(2). However, when non-rhizosphere soils were incubated at elevated pCO(2), displacement solutions had lower pH values, and much larger concentrations of elements, compared to soil centrifugates.
   Comparison of mass flow of elements versus actual plant uptake showed that Ca and Mg accumulated, while K, Zn and Cd were depleted from the rhizosphere. Displacement solutions showed this accumulation or depletion of the elements more clearly than soil centrifugates. These differences were attributed to the fact that, at constant soil moisture, the rhizosphere developed mainly in larger pores, which were sampled by displacement. With centrifugation, a mixture of pore sizes was sampled, so that rhizosphere solution was only obtained when all of the soil had become rhizosphere.
   Soil centrifugates obtained after 22 days of growth also contained higher concentrations of organic carbon than displacement solutions, indicating contamination due to the disruption of roots and/or micro-organisms. We conclude that water displacement is suitable for sampling solution from light to medium textured rhizosphere or non-rhizosphere soils and that soil centrifugation is only of limited suitability.

AB Root growth and development can affect N uptake. In turn, N additions may affect corn (Zea mays L.) root growth. Prolific (multiple ear) hybrids may need a more active root system to satisfy ear demand. To determine the extent of the effect of N fertilization on root growth in the field, three corn hybrids (Pioneer 3320, and prolific hybrids I202 x Mo17 and I117 x B73) were grown under fertilizer application rates of 56, 140, and 223 kg N ha(-1) to determine (i) whether application of N fertilizer stimulated root growth of corn in the zone of application in the field 20 d before silking, at silking, and at physiological maturity and (ii) whether prolific hybrids have enhanced root development before silking compared with nonprolific hybrids. Ah three hybrids were grown at a uniformly low plant-population density Root length density to a depth of 60 cm, averaged ol er hybrids, was 1302, 2238, and 1184 m plant(-1) in 1987, and 2195, 2833, and 3317 m plant(-1) in 1988 for the three sampling dates. There were few genotypic differences in root length density. Root weight averaged over hybrids was 20.4, 40.5, and 21.5 g plant(-1) in 1987, and 44.6, 61.7, and 58.9 g plant(-1) in 1988 for the three sampling times, respectively: Root weight at harvest declined as N application increased, but increased in response to N at two earlier sampling times. The second year of the study when rainfall was more plentiful than in the first year, root growth continued after silking for all hybrids. This coincided with higher yields. The data suggest that N stimulated root length in the area of application, without affecting total root length.

AB Seedlings of Ricinus communis L. cultivated in quartz sand were supplied with a nutrient solution containing either 0.2 mol m(-3) NO3- or 4.0 mol m(-3) NO3- as the nitrogen source to obtain insufficiently (low supply, nitrogen-limited) or well-fed plants (high supply, control). During the period between 41 and 51 d after sowing, the flows of C, N and inorganic ions between root and shoot were modelled on the basis of empirical observation and expressed on a fresh weight basis. With a low nitrate supply the biomass production was decreased while the root/shoot ratio was drastically increased and the water content in the shoot was slightly reduced. Nitrogen was transported in the xylem mainly in the form of nitrate in both treatments. However, in nitrate-limited plants the ratio of nitrate to total nitrogen was lower, indicating a higher fraction of whole-plant nitrate reduction occurring in the root. The spectrum of amino acids in phloem sap was changed due to N-limitation. Nitrate and cation uptake, as well as photosynthesis was strongly decreased in nitrate-limited plants. The partitioning of C, N and ions was shifted in favour of the root compared to well-fed plants. Transport of C, N, and cations in the xylem was decreased. Flows of ions and elements in the phloem were increased relative to uptake and xylem transport. In contrast, the chloride flows were nearly the same in low- and well-fed plants, pointing to a role of chloride as a compensating ion for nitrate.

AB Spinyhead blennies (Acanthemblemaria spinosa) and roughhead blennies (A. aspera) are planktivorous hole-dwelling fishes that live in dead coral skeletons. Both species are known to choose shelters high above the reef surface (although spinyheads displace roughheads downwards). To test the hypothesis that this preference is due to greater plankton availability in higher locations, fish were placed on artificial habitats located 15 cm and 100 cm above the surface of a natural reef. Both species experienced higher feeding rates, growth rates, and fecundities in high locations, and spinyhead rates generally exceeded roughhead rates at a given height. Under laboratory conditions, oxygen consumption by spinyheads was 1.6 times greater than that of roughheads and this corresponds well with the 1.8 ratio of feeding rates under controlled aquarium conditions. This information provides a partial explanation for the observed microhabitat distribution and resulting coexistence of these competing species: it is hypothesized that spinyheads have an advantage in agonistic interactions because of their higher metabolic rates, thus excluding roughheads from high sites, but that roughheads can persist at low sites because their lower metabolic rates result in lower food demands. A model is presented that predicts varying occurrences and vertical distributions of these species in locations with different zooplankton densities.

AB The responses of sour orange (SO) and Cleopatra mandarin (CM) to salt stress were studied because of the difference in their ability to accumulate Cl in the leaves.  Seedlings of these two citrus rootstocks were grown in fine sand under greenhouse conditions.  Salinity treatments were initiated by adding NaCl to half-strength Hoagland's solution to achieve final osmotic potentials of -0.10, -0.20, and -0.35 MPa.  The no-salt control treatment had an osmotic potential of -0.05 MPa.  Seedlings were harvested 6 months after starting NaCl treatments.
   No significant differences in growth, root hydraulic conductivity (RC), stomatal conductance, and evapotranspiration were detected between SO and CM.  However, all these variables were significantly reduced by NaCl.  At a relatively low salinity level (-0.10 MPa), shoot and root dry weights, stem cross-sectional area, total leaf area, and fibrous root length were reduced by 44-55%.  With all treatments, a positive linear relationship was found between RC and stomatal conductance.
   Significant differences between SO and CM were found in leaf succulence, specific leaf weight (SLW), Cl accumulation, and leaf chlorophyll content.  Sour orange seedlings accumulated higher amounts of Cl and had higher SLW and succulence but lower chlorophyll than CM seedlings.  At the first salinity level, chlorophyll was reduced by 56% in SO but only by 11% in CM.  The different responses to salt stress between the two rootstocks were mainly attributed to the known failure of SO to exclude Cl even at relatively low salinity levels.

AB Carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) are the primary elements involved in the growth and development of plants. The C:N ratio is an indicator of nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) and an input parameter for some ecological and ecosystem models. However, knowledge remains limited about the convergent or divergent variation in the C:N ratios among different plant organs (e.g., leaf, branch, trunk, and root) and how evolution and environment affect the coefficient shifts. Using systematic measurements of the leaf-branch-trunk-root of 2,139 species from tropical to cold-temperate forests, we comprehensively evaluated variation in C:N ratio in different organs in different taxa and forest types. The ratios showed convergence in the direction of change but divergence in the rate of change. Plants evolved toward lower C:N ratios in the leaf and branch, with N playing a more important role than C. The C:N ratio of plant organs (except for the leaf) was constrained by phylogeny, but not strongly. Both the change of C:N during evolution and its spatial variation (lower C:N ratio at midlatitudes) help develop the adaptive growth hypothesis. That is, plants with a higher C:N ratio promote NUE under strong N-limited conditions to ensure survival priority, whereas plants with a lower C:N ratio under less N-limited environments benefit growth priority. In nature, larger proportion of species with a high C:N ratio enabled communities to inhabit more N-limited conditions. Our results provide new insights on the evolution and drivers of C:N ratio among different plant organs, as well as provide a quantitative basis to optimize land surface process models.

AB To test the hitherto generally-accepted hypothesis that most aquatic macrophytes have broad world distributions, we investigated the global distribution, diversity and endemism patterns of 3457 macrophyte species that occur in permanent, temporary or ephemeral inland freshwater and brackish waterbodies worldwide. At a resolution of 10 x 10 degrees latitude x longitude, most macrophyte species were found to have narrow global distributions: 78% have ranges (measured using an approach broadly following the IUCN-defined concept "extent of occurrence") that individually occupy <10% of the world area present within the six global ecozones which primarily provide habitat for macrophytes. We found evidence of non-linear relationships between latitude and macrophyte alpha- and gamma-diversity, with diversity highest in sub-tropical to low tropical latitudes, declining slightly towards the Equator, and also declining strongly towards higher latitudes. Landscape aridity and, to a lesser extent, altitude and land area present per gridcell also influence macrophyte diversity and species assemblage worldwide. The Neotropics and Orient have the richest ecozone species-pools for macrophytes, depending on gamma-diversity metric used. The region around Brasilia/Goias (Brazil: gridcell 10-20 degrees S; 40-50 degrees W) is the richest global hotspot for macrophyte a-diversity (total species alpha-diversity, S-T: 625 species/gridcell, 350 of them Neotropical endemics). In contrast, the Sahara/Arabian Deserts, and some Arctic areas, have the lowest macrophyte alpha-diversity (S-T <20 species/gridcell). At ecozone scale, macrophyte species endemism is pronounced, though with a > 5-fold difference between the most species-rich (Neotropics) and species-poor (Palaearctic) ecozones. Our findings strongly support the assertion that small-ranged species constitute most of Earth's species diversity.

AB The recent extensive loss of biodiversity raises the question of whether organisms will adapt in time to survive the current era of rapid environmental change, and whether today's conservation practices and policies are appropriate. We review the benefits and risks of inter- and intraspecific hybridization as a conservation management tool aimed at enhancing adaptive potential and survival, with particular reference to coral reefs. We conclude that hybridization is underutilized and that many of its perceived risks are possibly overstated; the few applications of hybridization in conservation to date have already shown positive outcomes. Moreover, perceptions of potential risk change significantly when the focus of conservation is on preserving the adaptive potential of a species/population, instead of preserving the species in its original state. Further, we suggest that the uncertain legal status of hybrids as entities of protection can be costly to society and ecosystems, and that a legislative revision of hybrids and hybridization is overdue. We present a decision tree to help assess when and where hybridization can be a suitable conservation tool, and whether inter- or intraspecific hybridization is the preferred option.

AB Much uncertainty remains about traits linked with successful invasion - the establishment and spread of non-resident species into existing communities. Using a 20-year experiment, where 50 non-resident (but mostly native) grassland plant species were sown into savannah plots, we ask how traits linked with invasion depend on invasion stage (establishment, spread), indicator of invasion success (occupancy, relative abundance), time, environmental conditions, propagule rain, and traits of invaders and invaded communities. Trait data for 164 taxa showed that invader occupancy was primarily associated with traits of invaders, traits of recipient communities, and invader-community interactions. Invader abundance was more strongly associated with community traits (e.g. proportion legume) and trait differences between invaders and the most similar resident species. Annuals and invaders with high-specific leaf area were only successful early in stand development, whereas invaders with conservative carbon capture strategies persisted long-term. Our results indicate that invasion is context-dependent and long-term experiments are required to comprehensively understand invasions.

AB Functional traits are increasingly being used to predict extinction risks and range shifts under long-term climate change scenarios, but have rarely been used to study vulnerability to extreme climatic events, such as supraseasonal droughts. In streams, drought intensification can cross thresholds of habitat loss, where marginal changes in environmental conditions trigger disproportionate biotic responses. However, these thresholds have been studied only from a structural perspective, and the existence of functional nonlinearity remains unknown. We explored trends in invertebrate community functional traits along a gradient of drought intensity, simulated over 18 months, using mesocosms analogous to lowland headwater streams. We modelled the responses of 16 traits based on a priori predictions of trait filtering by drought, and also examined the responses of trait profile groups (TPGs) identified via hierarchical cluster analysis. As responses to drought intensification were both linear and nonlinear, generalized additive models (GAMs) were chosen to model response curves, with the slopes of fitted splines used to detect functional thresholds during drought. Drought triggered significant responses in 12 (75%) of the a priori-selected traits. Behavioural traits describing movement (dispersal, locomotion) and diet were sensitive to moderate-intensity drought, as channels fragmented into isolated pools. By comparison, morphological and physiological traits showed little response until surface water was lost, at which point we observed sudden shifts in body size, respiration mode and thermal tolerance. Responses varied widely among TPGs, ranging from population collapses of non-aerial dispersers as channels fragmented to irruptions of small, eurythermic dietary generalists upon extreme dewatering. Our study demonstrates for the first time that relatively small changes in drought intensity can trigger disproportionately large functional shifts in stream communities, suggesting that traits-based approaches could be particularly useful for diagnosing catastrophic ecological responses to global change.

AB With unfavourable climate changes and an increasing global population, there is a great need for more productive and stress-tolerant crops. As traditional methods of crop improvement have probably reached their limits, a further increase in the productivity of crops is expected to be possible using genetic engineering. The number of potential genes and metabolic pathways, which when genetically modified could result in improved photosynthesis and biomass production, is multiple. Photosynthesis, as the only source of carbon required for the growth and development of plants, attracts much attention is this respect, especially the question concerning how to improve CO2 fixation and limit photorespiration. The most promising direction for increasing CO2 assimilation is implementating carbon concentrating mechanisms found in cyanobacteria and algae into crop plants, while hitherto performed experiments on improving the CO2 fixation versus oxygenation reaction catalyzed by Rubisco are less encouraging. On the other hand, introducing the C-4 pathway into C-3 plants is a very difficult challenge.
   Among other points of interest for increased biomass production is engineering of metabolic regulation, certain proteins, nucleic acids or phytohormones. In this respect, enhanced sucrose synthesis, assimilate translocation to sink organs and starch synthesis is crucial, as is genetic engineering of the phytohormone metabolism. As abiotic stress tolerance is one of the key factors determining crop productivity, extensive studies are being undertaken to develop transgenic plants characterized by elevated stress resistance. This can be accomplished due to elevated synthesis of antioxidants, osmoprotectants and protective proteins. Among other promising targets for the genetic engineering of plants with elevated stress resistance are transcription factors that play a key role in abiotic stress responses of plants.
   In this review, most of the approaches to improving the productivity of plants that are potentially promising and have already been undertaken are described. In addition to this, the limitations faced, potential challenges and possibilities regarding future research are discussed.

AB Despite promises that healthy' marine systems show increased resilience, the effects of ecosystem management strategies on invasion success in marine systems is still unclear. We show that resistance to the invasive alga, Sargassum horneri, in a temperate reef system occurs through alternate mechanisms in different ecosystem states. In an old marine protected area (MPA), invasion of S. horneri was suppressed, likely due to competitive pressure from native algae, resulting from protection of urchin predators. In a nearby fished urchin barren, invasion of S. horneri was also suppressed, due to herbivory by urchins whose predators are fished. Within newer MPAs with intermediate levels of interacting species, S. horneri was abundant. Here, neither competition from native algae nor herbivory was sufficient to prevent invasion. We confirm that invasion in marine systems is complex and show that multiple mechanisms in single systems must be considered when investigating biotic resistance hypotheses.

AB Canopy photosynthesis (A(c)) describes photosynthesis of an entire crop field and the daily and seasonal integrals of A(c) positively correlate with daily and seasonal biomass production. Much effort in crop breeding has focused on improving canopy architecture and hence light distribution inside the canopy. Here, we develop a new integrated canopy photosynthesis model including canopy architecture, a ray tracing algorithm, and C-3 photosynthetic metabolism to explore the option of manipulating leaf chlorophyll concentration ([Chl]) for greater A(c) and nitrogen use efficiency (NUE). Model simulation results show that (a) efficiency of photosystem II increased when [Chl] was decreased by decreasing antenna size and (b) the light received by leaves at the bottom layers increased when [Chl] throughout the canopy was decreased. Furthermore, the modelling revealed a modest similar to 3% increase in A(c) and an similar to 14% in NUE was accompanied when [Chl] reduced by 60%. However, if the leaf nitrogen conserved by this decrease in leaf [Chl] were to be optimally allocated to other components of photosynthesis, both A(c) and NUE can be increased by over 30%. Optimizing [Chl] coupled with strategic reinvestment of conserved nitrogen is shown to have the potential to support substantial increases in A(c), biomass production, and crop yields.

AB 1. Population surveys are often used to estimate the density, abundance, or distribution of natural populations. Recently, model-based approaches to analyzing survey data have become popular because one can more readily accommodate departures from pre-planned survey routes and construct more detailed maps than one can with design-based procedures.
   2. Spatial models for population distributions (SMPDs) often make the implicit assumption that locations chosen for sampling and animal abundance at those locations are conditionally independent given modelled covariates. However, this assumption may be violated when survey effort is non-randomized, leading to preferential sampling.
   3. We develop a hierarchical statistical modelling framework for detecting and alleviating the biasing effects of preferential sampling in spatial distribution models fitted to count data. The approach works by specifying a joint model for population density and the locations selected for sampling, and specifying a dependent correlation structure between the two processes.
   4. Using simulation, we show that moderate levels of preferential sampling can lead to large (e.g. 40%) bias in estimates of animal density and that our modelling approach can considerably reduce this bias. In contrast, preferential sampling did not appear to bias inferences about parameters informing species-habitat relationships (i.e. slope parameters).
   5. We apply our approach to aerial survey counts of bearded seals (Erignathus barbatus) in the eastern Bering Sea. As expected, models with a preferential sampling effect led to lower abundance than those without. However, several lines of reasoning (better predictive performance, higher biological realism) led us to prefer models without a preferential sampling effect for this dataset.
   6. When population surveys break from traditional scientific survey design principles, ecologists should recognize the potentially biasing effects of preferential sampling when estimating population density or occurrence. Joint models, such as those described in this paper, can be used to test and correct for such biases. However, such models can be unstable; ultimately the best way to avoid preferential sampling bias is to incorporate design-based principles such as randomization and/or systematic sampling into survey design.

AB While community-weighted means of plant traits have been linked to mean environmental conditions at large scales, the drivers of trait variation within communities are not well understood. Local environmental heterogeneity ( such as microclimate variability), in addition to mean environmental conditions, may decrease the strength of environmental filtering and explain why communities support different amounts of trait variation. Here, we assess two hypotheses: first, that more heterogeneous local environments and second, that less extreme environments, should support a broader range of plant strategies and thus higher trait variation. We quantified drivers of trait variation across a range of environmental conditions and spatial scales ranging from sub-meter to tens of kilometers in montane and alpine plant communities. We found that, within communities, both environmental heterogeneity and environmental means are drivers of trait variation. However, the importance of each environmental factor varied depending on the trait. Our results indicate that larger-scale trait-climate linkages that hold across communities also apply at small spatial scales, suggesting that microclimate variation within communities is a key driver of community functional diversity. Microclimatic variation provides a potential mechanism for helping to maintain diversity in local communities and also suggests that small-scale environmental heterogeneity should be measured as a better predictor of functional diversity.

AB The major challenges of improving food security and biodiversity conservation are intricately linked. To date, the intersection of food security and biodiversity conservation has been viewed primarily through an agricultural "production lens"-for example, via the land sparing/sharing framework, or the concept of sustainable intensification. However, a productionist perspective has been criticized for being too narrow, and failing to consider other relevant factors, including policy, equity, and diversity. We propose an approach that conceptualizes rural landscapes as social-ecological systems embedded within intersecting multi-scalar processes. Based on such a framing, empirical research can be more clearly set in the context of system properties that may influence food security, biodiversity conservation, or both. We illustrate our approach through a description of contrasting agricultural systems within Brazil's Cerrado region. We emphasize the need for new empirical research involving systematic comparisons of social-ecological system properties in landscapes threatened by food insecurity and ecosystem degradation.

AB Semi-arid ecosystems play an important role in regulating the dynamics of the global terrestrial CO2 sink. These dynamics are mainly driven by increasing inter-annual precipitation variability. However, how ecosystem carbon processes respond to changes in precipitation is not well understood, due to a lack of substantial experimental evidence that combines increased and decreased precipitation treatments. This study, a 3-year field manipulation experiment with five precipitation levels conducted in a semi-arid steppe, examined the impacts of increased and decreased precipitation on ecosystem CO2 (GEP: gross ecosystem photosynthesis; ER: ecosystem respiration; NEE: net ecosystem CO2 exchange), water exchange (ET: evapotranspiration), and resource use efficiency (CUE: carbon use efficiency; WUE: water use efficiency). We found that decreased precipitation reduced ecosystem CO2, water exchange and resource use efficiency significantly, while increased precipitation did not cause significant influence on them. That is, they responded more sensitively to decreased precipitation. Soil water availability was the most important driver determining changes in GEP, ER and ET. Changes in NEE, CUE and WUE were predominately regulated by soil temperature. Photosynthesis at leaf and ecosystem levels showed significantly greater sensitivity to changed precipitation than respiration and ET, and therefore determined the trends of net carbon uptake and resource use efficiency. This study highlighted an asymmetric response of ecosystem carbon and water processes to altered precipitation. This is potentially important for improving our understanding of how possible future changes in precipitation will affect the carbon cycle. Taking this asymmetric response into consideration will inevitably reduce uncertainties in predicting the dynamics of the global carbon cycle.

AB The cumulative effects of increasing human use of the ocean and coastal zone have contributed to a rapid decline in ocean and coastal resources. As a result, scientists are investigating how multiple, overlapping stressors accumulate in the environment and impact ecosystems. These investigations are the foundation for the development of new tools that account for and predict cumulative effects in order to more adequately prevent or mitigate negative effects. Despite scientific advances, legal requirements, and management guidance, those who conduct assessments including resource managers, agency staff, and consultants continue to struggle to thoroughly evaluate cumulative effects, particularly as part of the environmental assessment process. Even though 45 years have passed since the United States National Environmental Policy Act was enacted, which set a precedent for environmental assessment around the world, defining impacts, baseline, scale, and significance are still major challenges associated with assessing cumulative effects. In addition, we know little about how practitioners tackle these challenges or how assessment aligns with current scientific recommendations. To shed more light on these challenges and gaps, we-undertook a comparative study on how cumulative effects assessment (CEA) is conducted by practitioners operating under some of the most well-developed environmental laws around the globe: California, USA; British Columbia, Canada; Queensland, Australia; and New Zealand. We found that practitioners used a broad and varied, definition of impact for CEA, which led to differences in how baseline, scale, and significance were determined. We also found that practice and science are not closely aligned and, as such, we highlight opportunities for managers, policy makers, practitioners, and scientists to improve environmental assessment.

AB AimWe propose and test a climate tolerance and trait choice hypothesis of urban macroecological variation in which strong filtering associated with low winter temperatures restricts urban biodiversity while weak filtering associated with warmer temperatures and irrigation allows dispersal of species from a global source pool, thereby increasing urban biodiversity.
   LocationTwenty cities across the USA and Canada.
   MethodsWe examined variation in tree community taxonomic diversity, origins and production of an aesthetic ecosystem service trait in a cross-section of urban field surveys. We correlated urban tree community composition indicators with a key climate restriction, namely mean minimum winter temperature, and evaluated alternative possible drivers: precipitation, summer maximum temperature, population size and the percentage of adults with a college education.
   ResultsSpecies accumulation curves differed substantially among cities, with observed richness varying from 22 to 122 species. Similarities in tree communities decreased exponentially with increases in climatic differences. Ordination of tree communities showed strong separation among cities with component axes correlated with minimum winter temperature and annual precipitation. Variation among urban tree communities in richness, origins and the provisioning of an aesthetic ecosystem service were all correlated with minimum winter temperature.
   Main conclusionsThe urban climate tolerance and trait choice hypothesis provides a coherent mechanism to explain the large variation among urban tree communities resulting from an interacting environment, species and human decisions. Reconciling the feedbacks between human decision making and biophysical limitations provides a foundation for an urban ecological theory that can better understand and predict the dynamics of other linked biotic communities, associated ecosystem dynamics and resulting services provided to urban residents.

AB Heavy browsing pressure from large ungulates is a multicontinent phenomenon that causes regeneration failure of many palatable tree species and induces important socioeconomic and ecological impacts in forest ecosystems. The development of forest management practices that address adequately this issue, however, remains scarce and challenging because (1) large herbivores are both a resource and a source of disturbance; (2) the management of forests and ungulate populations remains largely disconnected in practice; and (3) we still lack a good understanding of the role of critical factors, especially deer densities, vegetation attributes, and their interactions, on the magnitude of browsing damages on forest regeneration. We bring new insights into these challenging issues by critically reviewing the current methods used by managers and conservationists to mitigate deer impacts on forest regeneration, emphasizing the spatial scale at which these methods are undertaken. Specifically, we review management actions at multiple scales on both deer populations (e.g., hunting) and vegetation (e.g., silvicultural treatments) that are common to most deer-forest systems and, for that reason, deserve priority investigation. We identify strengths and limitations of current management actions and highlight the main research gaps. Based on this review, we propose a new integrated management scheme that explicitly addresses: (1) the integration and prioritization of management actions, (2) the development of adaptive management plans, and (3) the participation of stakeholders. Conflicting demands by different stakeholders have challenged the effectiveness of management strategies in deer-forest systems. To reverse this situation, we advocate for a shift of paradigm and the development of integrated strategies that (1) bridge the gap between management actions and the design of in situ experiments and (2) coordinate actions at multiple spatial scales on both deer populations and forests. We propose a new framework informed by key objectives and grounded in the adaptive management paradigm to support this transition, and suggest a research agenda for the next decade(s).

AB During a time of intensifying competition for land, Protected Areas (PAs) are coming under increasing pressure to justify their status. Positive local attitudes to a PA are a potentially important component of any such justification, especially in the developing world where human pressure on natural resources is often high. However, despite numerous studies our understanding of what drives positive attitudes to PAs is still exceedingly limited. Here, we review the literature on local attitudes towards PAs in developing countries. Our survey reveals a highly fragmented research area where studies typically lack an explicit conceptual basis, and where there is wide variation in choice of statistical approach, explanatory and response variables, and incorporation of contextual information. Nevertheless, there is a relatively high degree of concordance between studies, with certain variables showing strong associations with attitudes. We recommend that PA attitude researchers in developing countries adopt a more rigorous model building approach based on a clear conceptual framework and drawing on the extensive empirical literature. Such an approach would improve the quality of research, increase comparability, and provide a stronger basis to support conservation decision-making.

AB We provide improved biochemical assays for key carboxylases and decarboxylases involved in C-3 and C-4 photosynthesis. Together with leaf age-related changes in Rubisco activation, these measurements will improve photosynthetic modelling.Plants operating C-3 and C-4 photosynthetic pathways exhibit differences in leaf anatomy and photosynthetic carbon fixation biochemistry. Fully understanding this underpinning biochemical variation is requisite to identifying solutions for improving photosynthetic efficiency and growth. Here we refine assay methods for accurately measuring the carboxylase and decarboxylase activities in C-3 and C-4 plant soluble protein. We show that differences in plant extract preparation and assay conditions are required to measure NADP-malic enzyme and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (pH 8, Mg2+, 22 A degrees C) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (pH 7, > 2mM Mn2+, no Mg2+) maximal activities accurately. We validate how the omission of MgCl2 during leaf protein extraction, lengthy (> 1min) centrifugation times, and the use of non-pure ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP) significantly underestimate Rubisco activation status. We show how Rubisco activation status varies with leaf ontogeny and is generally lower in mature C-4 monocot leaves (45-60% activation) relative to C-3 monocots (55-90% activation). Consistent with their > 3-fold lower Rubisco contents, full Rubisco activation in soluble protein from C-4 leaves (< 5min) was faster than in C-3 plant samples (< 10min), with addition of Rubisco activase not required for full activation. We conclude that Rubisco inactivation in illuminated leaves primarily stems from RuBP binding to non-carbamylated enzyme, a state readily reversible by dilution during cellular protein extraction.

AB 1. Spread of alien species (AS) is a serious threat to marine habitats and analysis of principal descriptors of their occurrence is pivotal to set reliable conservation strategies. 2. In order to assess the susceptibility of marine habitats to biological invasions, a dataset was gathered of the occurrence of 3899 species from 29 phyla, taken from 93 marine sites located along the Italian coast in the period 2000-2012. 3. In total, 61 AS belonging to 11 phyla have been recorded. Invertebrates were the most represented (63%). Alien species were found in all the habitats examined (EUNIS, level 2), although they showed highest abundance in benthic habitats. Most of the AS were associated with a single EUNIS habitat, while some of them were present in more than one habitat. Trans-habitat occurrence suggests the potential invasiveness of AS. 4. According to statistical analysis, AS recorded could have been more numerous, since some of the marine habitats seemed to be still unsaturated. The model that best describes the spread of AS takes account of both native species richness (Rn) and EUNIS habitat type as explanatory variables. The number of observed AS was directly related to Rn and it was highest in rocky circalittoral and infralittoral habitats. 5. The results of this macro-ecological study focus on the importance of performing large-scale studies, since adopting ecosystem approaches to marine invasion management seems especially fruitful. 6. The results, moreover, highlight the importance of AS monitoring of different habitats, from those subjected to anthropogenic pressure, historically considered to be hubs of introduction of AS, to the most biologically rich and diverse marine habitats. Indeed, it is necessary to set monitoring strategies to detect the introduction, the distribution and persistence of AS over time. These recommendations are especially significant in the light of the strategic plans currently under formulation in Mediterranean countries with regard to AS monitoring.

AB Background: Drug treatments and vaccine designs against the opportunistic human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa have multiple issues, all associated with the diverse genetic traits present in this pathogen, ranging from multi-drug resistant genes to the molecular machinery for the biosynthesis of biofilms. Several candidate vaccines against P. aeruginosa have been developed, which target the outer membrane proteins; however, major issues arise when attempting to establish complete protection against this pathogen due to its presumably genotypic variation at the strain level. To shed light on this concern, we proposed this study to assess the P. aeruginosa pangenome and its molecular evolution across multiple strains.
   Results: The P. aeruginosa pangenome was estimated to contain more than 16,000 non-redundant genes, and approximately 15 % of these constituted the core genome. Functional analyses of the accessory genome indicated a wide presence of genetic elements directly associated with pathogenicity. An in-depth molecular evolution analysis revealed the full landscape of selection forces acting on the P. aeruginosa pangenome, in which purifying selection drives evolution in the genome of this human pathogen. We also detected distinctive positive selection in a wide variety of outer membrane proteins, with the data supporting the concept of substantial genetic variation in proteins probably recognized as antigens. Approaching the evolutionary information of genes under extremely positive selection, we designed a new Multi-Locus Sequencing Typing assay for an informative, rapid, and cost-effective genotyping of P. aeruginosa clinical isolates.
   Conclusions: We report the unprecedented pangenome characterization of P. aeruginosa on a large scale, which included almost 200 bacterial genomes from one single species and a molecular evolutionary analysis at the pangenome scale. Evolutionary information presented here provides a clear explanation of the issues associated with the use of protein conjugates from pili, flagella, or secretion systems as antigens for vaccine design, which exhibit high genetic variation in terms of non-synonymous substitutions in P. aeruginosa strains.

AB Floods and droughts are predicted to increase in intensity, duration and frequency in many future climate scenarios, yet long-term data that track before-and-after responses of natural communities remain scarce. We explored the impacts of a series of extreme events, including a particularly catastrophic flood, over 13years in the Glenfinish River in Ireland.
   Overall, seasonal cycles of absolute and relative abundance were the strongest temporal signal in the data, and the community as a whole was relatively persistent. At interannual scales, a core of c.15 taxa were present throughout most of the time series, which spanned >10 generations for most taxa, whereas extreme events had negligible or weak effects, with two notable exceptions. The catastrophic 1986 summer flood triggered a 10-fold decline in abundance: although most populations returned to their pre-disturbance state in <3years, some took up to a decade to recover. In 1988-1989, two contrasting extreme low-rainfall and storm events occurred within a year and were associated with far more marked compositional and functional shifts than were seen in the 1986 flood, although abundance was not so strongly affected.
   Contrasting extreme events that occur close to one another in time and/or at atypical times of year (e.g. floods in summer, when base flow is low) can have particularly strong effects, whereas at other times even the most extreme events may leave little longer-term footprint. Therefore, both the temporal context and the magnitude of events determine the biota's response.
   Effects of the events also varied across taxa and organisational levels: the more r-selected taxa (e.g. Chironomidae) were relatively unaffected compared with the larger, more K-selected taxa. Community-level responses were mostly driven by shifts in relative abundances, rather than species loss or turnover, and the functional diversity of species traits was more resilient still. The apparent stability in relative abundances of functional groups in the face of significant variation at the species level is suggestive of high functional redundancy, but without exhaustive further analyses using null-model approaches, this remains unproved. In turn, relatively high levels of redundancy and the reshuffling of species with similar traits could confer resilience in the face of all but the most extreme events.

AB Climate change has significant impacts on species' distributions and diversity patterns. Understanding range shifts and changes in richness gradients under climate change is crucial for conservation. The Tibetan Plateau, home to wild yak, chiru, and kiang, contains a biome with many endemic ungulates. It is highly sensitive to climate change and a region that merits particular attention with regard to the impacts of global climate change on its biomes. Maximum entropy approaches were used to estimate current and future potential distributions, in response to climate change, for 22 ungulate species. We used three general circulation (MK3, HADCM3, MIROC3_2-MED) and three emissions scenarios (B1, A1B, A2) to derive estimated future measurements of 14 environmental variables over three time periods (2020, 2050, 2080), and then modeled species distributions using these predicted environmental measurements for each time period under two dispersal hypotheses (full and zero, respectively). This resulted in a total of 6160 prediction models. We found that these ungulates, on average, may lose 30-50% of their distributional areas, depending on the dispersal scenarios. In addition, 55-68% of the ungulate species were predicted to become locally endangered under the different dispersal assumptions, 23-32% to become locally critically endangered, and 4-7 endemic species to become globally endangered. Furthermore, ungulate species ranges may experience average poleward shifts of; 300 km. We also predict west-to-east reductions in species richness: southeastern mountainous areas currently have the highest species richness, but are predicted to face the greatest diversity losses, whereas the northern areas are predicted to see increasing numbers of ungulate species in the 21st century. Our study indicates much more severe range reductions of ungulates on the Tibetan Plateau than those anticipated elsewhere in the world, and species richness patterns will change dramatically with climate change. For conservation, we suggest (1) securing existing protected areas, and (2) establishing new nature reserves to counterbalance climate change impacts.

AB A capacity to predict the effects of fire on biota is critical for conservation in fire-prone regions as it assists managers to anticipate the outcomes of different approaches to fire management. The task is complicated because species' responses to fire can vary geographically. This poses challenges, both for conceptual understanding of post-fire succession and fire management. We examine two hypotheses for why species may display geographically varying responses to fire. 1) Species' post-fire responses are driven by vegetation structure, but vegetation - fire relationships vary spatially (the dynamic vegetation' hypothesis). 2) Regional variation in ecological conditions leads species to select different post-fire ages as habitat (the dynamic habitat' hypothesis). Our case study uses data on lizards at 280 sites in a approximate to 100 000 km(2) region of south-eastern Australia. We compared the predictive capacity of models based on 1) habitat associations, with models based on 2) fire history and vegetation type, and 3) fire history alone, for four species of lizards. Habitat association models generally out-performed fire history models in terms of predictive capacity. For two species, habitat association models provided good discrimination capacity even though the species showed geographically varying post-fire responses. Our results support the dynamic vegetation hypothesis, that spatial variation in relationships between fire and vegetation structure results in regional variation in fauna-fire relationships. These observations explain how the widely recognised habitat accommodation' model of animal succession can be conceptually accurate yet predictively weak.

AB Aim We analyse how and why 'topoclimate' mapping methodologies improve on macroclimatic variables in modelling the distribution of biodiversity. Further, we consider the implications for climate change projections.
   Location Greater Hunter Valley region (c. 60,000 km(2)), New South Wales, Australia.
   Methods We fitted generalised linear models to 295 species of grasses and ferns at fine resolutions (< 50 m(2)) using (a) macroclimatic variables, interpolated from weather station data using altitude and location only, (b) topoclimatic variables, interpolated from field measurements using additional climate-forcing factors such as topography and canopy cover, and (c) both topoclimatic and macroclimatic variables. We conducted community-level analyses and examined the reasons for differences through single-species analyses. We projected species distributions under 0-3 degrees warming, comparing biodiversity loss predicted by topoclimate and macroclimate variables.
   Results At the community level, the topoclimatic variables explained significant variation (p < 0.002) in the distribution of both ferns and grasses not explained by macroclimatic variables, resulting in increases of 0.036-0.061 in the pseudo R-squared. Topoclimate performed better (as determined by AIC) than macroclimate for grass species living in cold extremes under topoclimate and most fern species. Models using topoclimatic temperature variables projected different locations of biodiversity loss/retention and in general projected substantially fewer species becoming critically endangered in the study region than models using macroclimatic temperature variables - in one scenario, topoclimate projected 10% of species becoming critically endangered where macroclimate projected 28%.
   Main Conclusions How climate variables are constructed has a significant effect on species distribution models and any subsequent climate change predictions. Misleading conclusions may result from models based on fine-resolution climate data if climate-forcing factors such as cold air drainage, topography and habitat have not been addressed in the climate mapping methodology.

AB Documenting patterns of published studies on the biodiversity of megadiverse countries can offer valuable insights on global biodiversity knowledge. Here, I present results from a bibliometric analysis of 5,264 indexed publications on biodiversity in Colombia published during the period 1990-2011 and gathered by searching the Web of Knowledge database. I classified studies into six overlapping subjects: taxa lists, new taxa, new records, conservation, genetic diversity, and other. Publications were also classified by geographic location and the taxonomic group studied. I found variation in the number of studies per year, which presented a long-term trend of increasing volume. The 31 continental departments of Colombia and both the Atlantic and the Pacific oceans were represented in the studies, which included 98 taxonomic classes from 47 phyla. However, there were strong biases in taxonomic, geographic, and subject coverage. For instance, 75 % of studies focused on animals; and the Atlantic Ocean showed the highest number of studies, followed by Antioquia and Valle del Cauca departments. Genetic diversity and conservation were the least-studied subjects. I also found that Colombian researchers and Colombian institutions have played an important role in documenting the country's outstanding biodiversity. However, Colombian biologists still prefer to publish in domestic or Latin American journals, which are mainly regional and have low international visibility. The patterns I present here can have important implications for optimizing and guiding research on Colombian biodiversity, and the paper concludes with some recommendations.

AB Background: Intraspecific genetic variation of African fauna has been significantly affected by pronounced climatic fluctuations in Plio-Pleistocene, but, with the exception of large mammals, very limited empirical data on diversity of natural populations are available for savanna-dwelling animals. Nothobranchius furzeri is an annual fish from south-eastern Africa, inhabiting discrete temporary savannah pools outside main river alluvia. Their dispersal is limited and population processes affecting its genetic structure are likely a combination of those affecting terrestrial and aquatic taxa. N. furzeri is a model taxon in ageing research and several populations of known geographical origin are used in laboratory studies. Here, we analysed the genetic structure, diversity, historical demography and temporal patterns of divergence in natural populations of N. furzeri across its entire distribution range.
   Results: Genetic structure and historical demography of N. furzeri were analysed using a combination of mitochondrial (partial cytochrome b sequences, 687 bp) and nuclear (13 microsatellites) markers in 693 fish from 36 populations. Genetic markers consistently demonstrated strong population structuring and suggested two main genetic groups associated with river basins. The split was dated to the Pliocene (>2 Mya). The northern group inhabits savannah pools across the basin of the intermittent river Chefu in south-western Mozambique and eastern Zimbabwe. The southern group (from southernmost Mozambique) is subdivided, with the River Limpopo forming a barrier (maximum divergence time 1 Mya). A strong habitat fragmentation (isolated temporary pools) is reflected in significant genetic structuring even between adjacent pools, with a major influence of genetic drift and significant isolation-by-distance. Analysis of historical demography revealed that the expansion of both groups is ongoing, supported by frequent founder effects in marginal parts of the range and evidence of secondary contact between Chefu and Limpopo populations.
   Conclusions: We demonstrated: (1) ancient (pre-Pleistocene) divergence between the two main N. furzeri lineages, their recent secondary contact and lack of reproductive isolation; (2) important genetic structuring attributed to the fragmented nature of their environment and isolation-by-distance, suggesting that dispersal is limited, occurs over short distances and is not directly associated with river routes; (3) an apparent role of the River Limpopo as a barrier to dispersal and gene flow.

AB Recent studies report that multifunctionality-the simultaneous provision of multiple ecosystem functions-in drylands depends on biodiversity. Others report that specific size distributions of vegetation patches indicate overall ecosystem health and function. Using a biocrust (micro-vegetation of mosses, lichens, and cyanobacteria) model system, and multivariate modeling, we determined the relative importance of biodiversity, patch-size distribution, and total abundance to nutrient cycling and multifunctionality. In most cases we explained at least 20%, and up to 65%, of the variation in ecosystem functions, and 42% of the variation in multifunctionality. Species richness was the most important determinant of C cycling, constituting an uncommonly clear link between diversity and function in a non-experimental field setting. Regarding C cycling in gypsiferous soils, we found that patch size distributions with a greater frequency of small to medium patches, as opposed to very small patches, were more highly functional. Nitrogen cycling was largely a function of biocrust cover in two soil types, whereas in gypsiferous soils, more central-tending patch size distributions were less functional with regards to N cycling. All three community properties were about equally important to multifunctionality. Our results highlight the functional role of biotic attributes other than biodiversity, and indicate that high cover and diversity, together with a particular patch-size distribution, must be attained simultaneously to maximize multifunctionality. The results also agree with trends observed with other terrestrial and aquatic communities that more biodiversity is needed to sustain multifunctionality compared to single functions considered independently.

AB In this paper we assess trade-offs between ecosystem services in a spatially explicit manner. From a supply side perspective, we estimate opportunity costs, which reflect in monetary terms the trade-offs between ecosystem services due to a marginal land use change. These are based on estimation of the frontier function, which gives the feasible bundles of ecosystem services that can be generated. For this, a two-stage semi-parametric method is applied and spatial data are used on agricultural revenues, cultural services, carbon sequestration and biodiversity for 18 Central and Eastern European countries. Based on the estimates, we assess which regions are most suitable for expanding any of the ecosystem services. Where opportunity costs are low, a further expansion of any of the ecosystem services is cost-effective. If areas are targeted carefully, joint improvement of several ecosystem services can be reached. If carbon sequestration levels are to be increased, it is best to focus on areas already having high sequestration levels because opportunity costs of carbon sequestration decrease with increasing sequestration levels. For biodiversity and cultural services the pattern is less clear as low opportunity cost were found both in areas rich and poor with these services. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Decomposition of plant residues is largely mediated by soil-dwelling microorganisms whose activities are influenced by both climate conditions and properties of the soil. However, a comprehensive understanding of their relative importance remains elusive, mainly because traditional methods, such as soil incubation and environmental surveys, have a limited ability to differentiate between the combined effects of climate and soil. Here, we performed a large-scale reciprocal soil transplantation experiment, whereby microbial communities associated with straw decomposition were examined in three initially identical soils placed in parallel in three climate regions of China (red soil, Chao soil, and black soil, located in midsubtropical, warm-temperate, and cold-temperate zones). Maize straws buried in mesh bags were sampled at 0.5, 1, and 2 years after the burial and subjected to chemical, physical, and microbiological analyses, e.g., phospholipid fatty acid analysis for microbial abundance, community-level physiological profiling, and 16S rRNA gene denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, respectively, for functional and phylogenic diversity. Results of aggregated boosted tree analysis show that location rather soil is the primary determining factor for the rate of straw decomposition and structures of the associated microbial communities. Principal component analysis indicates that the straw communities are primarily grouped by location at any of the three time points. In contrast, microbial communities in bulk soil remained closely related to one another for each soil. Together, our data suggest that climate (specifically, geographic location) has stronger effects than soil on straw decomposition; moreover, the successive process of microbial communities in soils is slower than those in straw residues in response to climate changes.

AB Invasive species are expected to cluster on the "high-return'' end of the leaf economic spectrum, displaying leaf traits consistent with higher carbon assimilation relative to native species. Intra-leaf nitrogen (N) allocation should support these physiological differences; however, N biochemistry has not been examined in more than a few invasive species. We measured 34 leaf traits including seven leaf N pools for five native and five invasive species from Hawaii under low irradiance to mimic the forest understory environment. We found several trait differences between native and invasive species. In particular, invasive species showed preferential N allocation to metabolism (amino acids) rather than photosynthetic light reactions (membrane-bound protein) by comparison with native species. The soluble protein concentration did not vary between groups. Under these low irradiance conditions, native species had higher light-saturated photosynthetic rates, possibly as a consequence of a greater investment in membrane-bound protein. Invasive species may succeed by employing a wide range of N allocation mechanisms, including higher amino acid production for fast growth under high irradiance or storage of N in leaves as soluble protein or amino acids.

AB 1.Effective management of aquatic fauna requires knowledge of the ways in which populations in different catchments and sub-catchments are connected. A powerful way to estimate this is using genetic markers, which provide information on the average amount of genetic connectivity among populations over generations. Although many studies of genetic connectivity have appeared in the literature, there are innumerable species that have not been studied. 2.This study explores whether it is possible to make broad generalisations about population connectivity, based on readily available information in the form of species life history and architecture of the aquatic habitat. 3.A number of models have been proposed to explain the pattern of connectivity shown by aquatic species with different life-history characteristics, for example, the stream hierarchy model, Isolation by Distance, the Death Valley Model, the headwater model and panmixia. 4.In this study, we propose a dichotomous key to assign species to different models of potential connectivity. The key is based on a few very simple questions about the life history of the species and the geographical arrangement of study sites. We then assessed the performance of the key with 109 data sets of Australian fish and macroinvertebrates, using genetic data to provide an estimate of realised connectivity. 5.The realised connectivity fitted the proposed potential connectivity model in over 70% of cases, and we suggest this might be a useful initial approach for managers where empirical data are lacking.

AB In an industrial/mining city, land use, ecosystem service values (ESVs) and local economy have a close relation. The study reported in this paper is conducive to optimising land use and to balancing ecosystem services and local economy. The aim is to provide useful information and advice for industrial/mining cities concerned with sustainable development. Wu'an, which is rich in mineral resources and an important energy supplier in Hebei Province, is selected as the study area. The ecosystem service value coefficients of industrial ecosystem and urban ecosystem are estimated adopting the cost method and applied to the city from 1996 to 2005. The temporal and spatial changes of the ESVs estimated within the entire ecosystem, sub-ecosystems and individual ecosystem services are analysed and discussed based on land use. The results show that land use in Wu'an had a great influence on the ESVs and especially the project of converting farmland into forests determined the entire ecosystem structure and functions. Additionally, the study shows the comparing relationships between ecosystem service values and local economy through various mathematical expressions. One significant relationship can be abstracted into an inverse curve (zone) under restrained conditions. The conclusions suggest that the rapid local economy development should build on a reasonable land use with emphasis on the high ecosystem services. Copyright (c) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Ninety alien species have been identified from British marine and brackish environments; of which 58 are established. Their arrival has been principally due to shipping and imported consignments of cultured species. The majority of alien species were initially reported from the English Channel, with many subsequently spreading northwards to the North or Celtic Seas. The majority of aliens in Britain originate from the North Pacific (N=35), followed by the North-west Atlantic (N=22). Additional alien species may be expected as a result of continued trade, port, and marina developments. Alterations in climate and extreme weather events are likely to result in future changes to the distribution of marine and brackish water alien species around the British coast.

AB Artificial propagation strategies often incur selection in captivity that leads to traits that are maladaptive in the wild. For propagation programs focused on production rather than demographic contribution to wild populations, effects on wild populations can occur through unintentional escapement or the need to release individuals into natural environments for part of their life cycle. In this case, 2 alternative management strategies might reduce unintended fitness consequences on natural populations: (1) reduce selection in captivity as much as possible to reduce fitness load (keep them similar), or (2) breed a separate population to reduce captive-wild interactions as much as possible (make them different). We quantitatively evaluate these 2 strategies with a coupled demographicgenetic model based on Pacific salmon hatcheries that incorporates a variety of relevant processes and dynamics: selection in the hatchery relative to the wild, assortative mating based on the trait under selection, and different life cycle arrangements in terms of hatchery release, density dependence, natural selection, and reproduction. Model results indicate that, if natural selection only occurs between reproduction and captive release, the similar strategy performs better. However, if natural selection occurs between captive release and reproduction, the different and similar strategies present viable alternatives to reducing unintended fitness consequences because of the greater opportunity to purge maladaptive individuals. In this case, the appropriate approach depends on the feasibility of each strategy and the demographic goal (e.g., increasing natural abundance, or ensuring that a high proportion of natural spawners are naturally produced). In addition, the fitness effects of hatchery release are much greater if hatchery release occurs before (vs. after) density-dependent interactions. Given the logistical challenges to achieving both the similar and different strategies, evaluation of not just the preferred strategy but also the consequences of failing to achieve the desired target is critical.

AB Reliable projections of future climate require land-atmosphere carbon (C) fluxes to be represented realistically in Earth system models (ESMs). There are several sources of uncertainty in how carbon is parameterised in these models. First, while interactions between the C, nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) cycles have been implemented in some models, these lead to diverse changes in land-atmosphere fluxes. Second, while the first-order parameterisation of soil organic matter decomposition is similar between models, formulations of the control of the soil physical state on microbial activity vary widely. For the first time, we address these sources of uncertainty simultaneously by implementing three soil moisture and three soil temperature respiration functions in an ESM that can be run with three degrees of biogeochemical nutrient limitation (C-only, C and N, and C and N and P). All 27 possible combinations of response functions and biogeochemical mode are equilibrated before transient historical (1850-2005) simulations are performed. As expected, implementing N and P limitation reduces the land carbon sink, transforming some regional sinks into net sources over the historical period. Meanwhile, regardless of which nutrient mode is used, various combinations of response functions imply a two-fold difference in the net ecosystem accumulation and a four-fold difference in equilibrated total soil C. We further show that regions with initially larger pools are more likely to become carbon sources, especially when nutrient availability limits the response of primary production to increasing atmospheric CO2. Simulating changes in soil C content therefore critically depends on both nutrient limitation and the choice of respiration functions.

AB In recent years, geographic information systems (GIS) have become a powerful tool for mapping and assessing the provision of ecosystem services within a landscape. GIS can help land managers and conservationists visualize spatial and temporal patterns and changes in ecosystem services and estimate the potential impact from projected changes in land use or management or climatic conditions on the provision of these services. The end-goal of ecosystem service assessment is usually to estimate marginal values of ecosystem services to inform decisions where trade-offs in ecosystem service provision will affect human well-being. Because our ability to estimate the provision of ecosystem services underlies our ability to estimate their societal values, the theoretical bases of GIS approaches and models for assessing ecosystem services need to be well understood before they are employed for decision-making purposes. This paper reviews GIS approaches and software developed for the assessment of ecosystem services and highlights their strengths and weaknesses in the context of different end uses.

AB Few studies have documented the impacts of habitat fragmentation on plant mating patterns together with fitness. Yet, these processes require urgent attention to better understand the impact of contemporary landscape change on biodiversity and for guiding native plant genetic resource management. We examined these relationships using the predominantly insect-pollinated Eucalyptus socialis. Progeny were collected from trees located in three increasingly disturbed landscapes in southern Australia and were planted out in common garden experiments. We show that individual mating patterns were increasingly impacted by lower conspecific density caused by habitat fragmentation. We determined that reduced pollen diversity probably has effects over and above those of inbreeding on progeny fitness. This provides an alternative mechanistic explanation for the indirect density dependence often inferred between conspecific density and offspring fitness.

AB In lichen symbiosis, fungal and algal partners form close associations, often codispersed by vegetative propagules. Due to the particular interdependence, processes such as colonization, dispersal or genetic drift are expected to result in congruent patterns of genetic structure in the symbionts. To study the population structure of an obligate symbiotic system in Europe, we genotyped the fungal and algal symbionts of the epiphytic lichen Lobaria pulmonaria at eight and seven microsatellite loci, respectively, and analysed about 4300 L. pulmonaria thalli from 142 populations from the species' European distribution range. Based on a centroid approach, which localizes centres of genetic differentiation with a high frequency of geographically restricted alleles, we identified the South ItalyBalkan region as the primary glacial refugial area of the lichen symbiosis. Procrustean rotation analysis and a distance congruence test between the fungal and algal population graphs indicated general concordance between the phylogeographies of the symbionts. The incongruent patterns found in areas of postglacial recolonization may show the presence of an additional refugial area for the fungal symbiont, and the impact that horizontal photobiont transmission and different mutation rates of the symbionts have on their genotypic associations at a continental scale.

AB Phytoplankton of eutrophic shallow lakes are frequently dominated by one species or species of the same functional group, resulting in species-pure algal assemblages. Knowledge of the structure of these assemblages is essential to understand their functioning; therefore, species and functional diversity were investigated in five sub-types of eutrophic shallow lake. Among the sub-types, astatic saline lakes and hypertrophic ponds had type-specific assemblages dominated by S-N and W0, W1 codons. The diversity of the phytoplankton in the sub-types was quite similar, except for the astatic saline lakes, which were characterised by lower values of both functional and species diversity. We found that both functional and species diversity were low when bloom-forming cyanobacteria (H1, S-N functional groups) became dominant. Dominance of other groups (J, Y, L-O and W1) did not coincide with decrease in species diversity. Analysis of the biovolume versus diversity relationships revealed that decrease in diversity might be expected at biovolume > 20 mm(3) l(-1) for shallow lakes.

AB Pest Risk Analyses (PRAs) are conducted worldwide to decide whether and how exotic plant pests should be regulated to prevent invasion. There is an increasing demand for science-based risk mapping in PRA. Spread plays a key role in determining the potential distribution of pests, but there is no suitable spread modelling tool available for pest risk analysts. Existing models are species specific, biologically and technically complex, and data hungry. Here we present a set of four simple and generic spread models that can be parameterised with limited data. Simulations with these models generate maps of the potential expansion of an invasive species at continental scale. The models have one to three biological parameters. They differ in whether they treat spatial processes implicitly or explicitly, and in whether they consider pest density or pest presence/absence only. The four models represent four complementary perspectives on the process of invasion and, because they have different initial conditions, they can be considered as alternative scenarios. All models take into account habitat distribution and climate. We present an application of each of the four models to the western corn rootworm, Diabrotica virgifera virgifera, using historic data on its spread in Europe. Further tests as proof of concept were conducted with a broad range of taxa (insects, nematodes, plants, and plant pathogens). Pest risk analysts, the intended model users, found the model outputs to be generally credible and useful. The estimation of parameters from data requires insights into population dynamics theory, and this requires guidance. If used appropriately, these generic spread models provide a transparent and objective tool for evaluating the potential spread of pests in PRAs. Further work is needed to validate models, build familiarity in the user community and create a database of species parameters to help realize their potential in PRA practice.

TI Weed Risk Assessment for Aquatic Plants: Modification of a New Zealand
   System for the United States
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID INVASIONS
AB We tested the accuracy of an invasive aquatic plant risk assessment system in the United States that we modified from a system originally developed by New Zealand's Biosecurity Program. The US system is comprised of 38 questions that address biological, historical, and environmental tolerance traits. Values associated with each response are summed to produce a total score for each species that indicates its risk of invasion. To calibrate and test this risk assessment, we identified 39 aquatic plant species that are major invaders in the continental US, 31 species that have naturalized but have no documented impacts (minor invaders), and 60 that have been introduced but have not established. These species represent 55 families and span all aquatic plant growth forms. We found sufficient information to assess all but three of these species. When the results are compared to the known invasiveness of the species, major invaders are distinguished from minor and non-invaders with 91% accuracy. Using this approach, the US aquatic weed risk assessment correctly identifies major invaders 85%, and non-invaders 98%, of the time. Model validation using an additional 10 non-invaders and 10 invaders resulted in 100% accuracy for the former, and 80% accuracy for the latter group. Accuracy was further improved to an average of 91% for all groups when the 17% of species with scores of 31-39 required further evaluation prior to risk classification. The high accuracy with which we can distinguish non-invaders from harmful invaders suggests that this tool provides a feasible, pro-active system for pre-import screening of aquatic plants in the US, and may have additional utility for prioritizing management efforts of established species.

AB Tephritid fruit flies, an important pest of horticulture worldwide, are increasingly targeted for control or eradication by large-scale releases of sterile flies of the same species. For each species treated, strains must be domesticated for mass rearing to provide sufficiently large numbers of individuals for releases. Increases in productivity of domesticated tephritid strains are well documented, but there have been few systematic studies of the genetic consequences of domestication in tephritids. Here, we used nine DNA microsatellite markers to monitor changes in genetic diversity during the early generations of domestication in replicated lines of the fruit fly Bactrocera tryoni (Froggatt) (Diptera: Tephritidae). The observed changes in heterozygosity and allelic richness were compared with the expected changes in heterozygosity generated by a stochastic simulation including genetic drift but not selection. The results showed that repeatable genetic bottlenecks occur in the early generations and that selection occurs in the later generations. Furthermore, using the same simulation, we show that there is inadvertent selection for increased productivity for the entire life on a mass-rearing colony, in addition to intentional selection for increased productivity. That additional selection results from the common practice of establishing the next generation of the breeding colony from a small proportion of one day's pupae collection (the pupal raffle). That selection occurs during all generations and acts only on fecundity variation. Practical methods to counter that unavoidable loss of genetic diversity during the domestication process in B. tryoni are discussed.

AB Wildlife management often hinges upon an accurate assessment of population density. Although undeniably useful, many of the traditional approaches to density estimation such as visual counts, livetrapping, or markrecapture suffer from a suite of methodological and analytical weaknesses. Rare, secretive, or highly mobile species exacerbate these problems through the reality of small sample sizes and movement on and off study sites. In response to these difficulties, there is growing interest in the use of non-invasive survey techniques, which provide the opportunity to collect larger samples with minimal increases in effort, as well as the application of analytical frameworks that are not reliant on large sample size arguments. One promising survey technique, the use of scat detecting dogs, offers a greatly enhanced probability of detection while at the same time generating new difficulties with respect to non-standard survey routes, variable search intensity, and the lack of a fixed survey point for characterizing non-detection. In order to account for these issues, we modified an existing spatially explicit, capturerecapture model for camera trap data to account for variable search intensity and the lack of fixed, georeferenced trap locations. We applied this modified model to a fisher (Martes pennanti) dataset from the Sierra National Forest, California, and compared the results (12.3?fishers/100?km2) to more traditional density estimates. We then evaluated model performance using simulations at 3 levels of population density. Simulation results indicated that estimates based on the posterior mode were relatively unbiased. We believe that this approach provides a flexible analytical framework for reconciling the inconsistencies between detector dog survey data and density estimation procedures.

AB Extreme, short-duration fluctuations caused by storage hydropower plant discharges or 'hydropeaking' occur when hydropower is used to cover the peak electrical loading conditions of a power network. The overall effects of hydropeaking can result in serious disturbances to the hydrologic regime, river morphology and the ecological condition of a river. In this study a transient, fuzzy logic based two-dimensional fish habitat model was used to investigate the stranding risk to juvenile European grayling (Thymallus thymallus) corresponding to different river morphologies. The stranding risk was simulated using two 24 hour discharge hydrographs in two alpine gravel bed river reaches. Both reaches were in close proximity to the hydropower plant outlet and were chosen due to their starkly contrasting morphological features. Spatially distributed stranding risk was determined based on a multi-step procedure which took into account the stationary habitat suitability, critical dewatering rates and flow depths. Although the number of reaches used in the investigation was limited in scope, clear distinctions with respect to the stranding risk were found. The reach with wider, flatter cross sections had a larger amount of stranding risk areas as compared to the reach with a steeply incised channel form. Stranding risk was found to be related to a specific set of changes in the discharge than to a particular rate of change or magnitude of the flow fluctuations. The temporal distribution of stranding risk was found to be almost identical for both reaches.

AB Plant invasions can have large effects on ecosystem services. Some plant invaders were introduced specifically to restore key services to ecosystems, and other invaders are having unintended, detrimental effects on services, such as the quantity and quality of water delivered, flood control, erosion control, and food production. Many ecosystem services are difficult to measure directly, and although there are extensive studies on plant invaders and ecosystem processes, a number of challenges prevent us from confidently extrapolating those processes as proxies for services. To extrapolate local, short-term measures of processes to ecosystem services, we must: (1) determine which processes are the key contributors to a service, (2) assess how multiple processes interact to provide a given service, (3) determine how vegetation types and species affect those processes, and (4) explicitly assess how ecosystem services and their controls vary over space and time, including reliance of ecosystem services on "hot spots" and "hot moments" and a minimum size of a vegetation type in the landscape. A given invader can have positive effects on some services and negative effects on others. It is important to consider that, in some systems, shifting environmental conditions may no longer support native species and that invasive species may be critical contributors to the resilience of ecosystem services.

AB Aim We use the Stramonita haemastoma species complex (Muricidae) to investigate the geographic scale of speciation in a marine snail with a long pelagic larval duration (PLD) of 2-3 months and, consequently, high dispersal potential. We aim to: (1) delimit species within Stramonita, (2) discover the phylogenetic relationship among them, (3) map their distributions, and (4) infer the age and likely cause of speciation events.
   Location Tropical intertidal of the Atlantic and eastern Pacific Oceans.
   Methods We use one nuclear and two mitochondrial genes to construct a molecular phylogeny of the S. haemastoma species complex. We first test the monophyly of the genus and of the species complex, and then use statistical methods to delimit species within the complex. We incorporate information from museum collections and the literature to map distributions and to look for diagnostic morphological traits. We use fossils to date our phylogeny.
   Results The genus Stramonita is monophyletic and restricted to the tropical and warm-temperate Atlantic and eastern Pacific oceans. The genus is composed of Stramonita delessertiana and six members of the S. haemastoma complex: S. haemastoma, Stramonita rustica, Stramonita floridana, Stramonita canaliculata, Stramonita biserialis and Stramonita brasiliensis (new species described herein). These species are supported by reciprocal monophyly in mitochondrial gene trees, together with independent evidence from morphology, distribution and the nuclear gene. The species are almost entirely allopatric, with only three instances of sympatry. Two species have unusually wide distributions, consistent with their long PLD; one of these is amphi-Atlantic.
   Main conclusions Despite the long PLD of Stramonita, speciation has occurred within the Atlantic, both in response to barriers operating at the largest geographical scale (the width of Atlantic, but not the Amazon barrier) and at a smaller scale within the western Atlantic.

AB Knowledge of land cover dynamics and driving forces is a fundamental tool for landscape planning and management. Nevertheless, this understanding is often limited by the paucity of accurate land cover data. In this sense, remote-sensing offers the possibility of acquiring detailed land cover inventories by applying different methods of image classification. However, in heterogeneous and changing landscapes, these data may be insufficient to detect temporal changes (and their causes) because of the uncertainty associated with misclassification and the spatio-temporal variability of change patterns. In this work, we present a multi-temporal uncertainty-based method that incorporates regression models to establish the risk (probability) of land cover change (RLCC), as a function of a set of environmental and socioeconomic driving factors. After filtering out uncertainty for dependent variables (land cover changes), the accuracy of the models increased and regression yielded more parsimonious models that identified the relevant predictors more efficiently. Considering all land cover changes as a whole, drivers relating to the physical environment (i.e., soil properties, accessibility, altitude, slope, solar radiation and rainfall) were more frequently selected than those related to agriculture, society or economy, which may be due to the poor quality of the available socioeconomic data at the municipality level. When analysing changes separately, several differences appeared (e.g. woody vegetation cover was related with fire events and water availability or human management with forest expansion). Our methodological approach has demonstrated that uncertainty plays an important role in model characterisation and identification of potential drivers of change. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB Many different models can be built to explain the distributions of species. Often there is no single model that is clearly better than the alternatives, and this leads to uncertainty over which environmental factors are limiting species' distributions. We investigated the support for different environmental factors by determining the drop in model performance when selected predictors were excluded from the model building process. We used a paired t-test over 37 plant species so that an environmental factor was only deemed significant if it consistently improved the results for multiple species. Geology and winter minimum temperatures were found to be the environmental factors with the most support, with a significant drop in model performance when either of these factors was excluded. However, there was less support for summer maximum temperature, as other environmental factors could combine to produce similar model performance. Our method of evaluating environmental factors using multiple species will not be capable of detecting predictors that are only important for one or two species, but it is difficult to distinguish these from spurious correlations. The strength of the method is that it increases inference for factors that consistently affect the distributions of many species. We discourage the assessment of models against predefined benchmarks, such as an area under the curve (AUC) of more than 0.7, as many alternative models for the same species produce similar results. Therefore, the benchmarks do not provide any indication of how the performance of the selected model compares to alternative models, and they provide weak inference to accept any selected model.

AB Determining the distribution of habitat-forming scleractinian corals in the New Zealand region is necessary in order to understand the ecological significance of these taxa and the likely impact of anthropogenic activities on their persistence. Historical records from early publications, research trawl surveys, commercial fishing bycatch and recent biodiversity surveys were compiled for the habitat-forming coral species Madrepora oculata, Solenosmilia variabilis, Goniocorella dumosa, Enallopsammia rostrata and Oculina virgosa. These data were used to describe the observed depth, geographic distribution and geomorphic habitat associations of the study corals in the region. A boosted regression trees analysis was also used to identify which of 11 environmental variables best describe the distribution of the 5 species across the New Zealand region, and to predict their spatial distribution. The contribution of the environmental variables differed greatly between species, but consistently identified depth and seamount occurrence as important factors de scribing observed coral species distribution. The models identified that M. oculata, S. variabilis and E. rostrata occurred in deep waters (> 1000 m) where seabed slopes were steep, tidal current and orbital velocities were slow, sea surface primary productivity was low, and where seamounts were generally present. By contrast, G. dumosa and O. virgosa were found in relatively shallower waters, where sea surface primary productivity was high and tidal current speeds were generally fast. Spatial predictions were consistent with the recorded observations and identified that all species, apart from O. virgosa, were distributed throughout the region and were found primarily between similar to 200 and 2000 m.

AB Bayesian networks are one of the most powerful tools in the design of expert systems located in an uncertainty framework. However, normally their application is determined by the discretization of the continuous variables. In this paper the naive Bayes (NB) and tree augmented naive Bayes (TAN) models are developed. They are based on Mixtures of Truncated Exponentials (MTE) designed to deal with discrete and continuous variables in the same network simultaneously without any restriction. The aim is to characterize the habitat of the spur-thighed tortoise (Testudo graeca graeca), using several continuous environmental variables, and one discrete (binary) variable representing the presence or absence of the tortoise. These models are compared with the full discrete models and the results show a better classification rate for the continuous one. Therefore, the application of continuous models instead of discrete ones avoids loss of statistical information due to the discretization. Moreover, the results of the TAN continuous model show a more spatially accurate distribution of the tortoise. The species is located in the Donana Natural Park, and in semiarid habitats. The proposed continuous models based on MTEs are valid for the study of species predictive distribution modelling. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Field experiments were conducted over two growing seasons to investigate the effects of variations in water regime and planting pattern on the growth of rice plant roots and shoots and on yield. Four water regimes were evaluated with split plot design: intermittent flooding during the vegetative stage only (IF-V); intermittent flooding extending into the reproductive stage (IF-R); not flooded (NF); and continuously flooded (CF), interacting with three different planting patterns: single seedling per hill with wider 30 x 30 cm spacing (P1); single seedling per hill with closer 20 x 20 cm spacing (P2); and three to four seedlings per hill with 20 x 20 cm spacing (P3). The treatment combination CF/P3 corresponds most closely with current conventional practice. The other combinations were evaluated to contribute to a better understanding of the effects of the two parameters studied, respectively and together. IF-V/P1 was considered as an approximation of System of Rice Intensification (SRI) practice. This study found that the combination of singly transplanted seedlings, both P1 and P2, with the IF-V water regime improved root length density, root physiological activity, and chlorophyll content of the upper and lower leaves, leading to higher grain yield compared with the other treatment combinations. With continuous flooding (CF), P2 gave 23 % more yield compared with the P3 planting pattern. Combining IF-V and P2 produced 32 % more grain yield compared with the CF/P3 treatment. These results showed a synergistic effect on grain yield from reduced intra-hill competition and IF-V water management. In these trials, there was no significant yield difference between the IF-V/P1 and CF/P3 treatments. Wider spacing improved the performance of individual hills when grown under IF-V water regimes, but tiller number per unit area remained a dominant determinant of yield. The yield reduction observed for CF/P1 compared with CF/P3 indicated that in more hypoxic CF soils, denser plant populations can produce more than sparser ones, whereas the latter benefit from more aerobic soil conditions. Intermittent irrigation during the vegetative growth stage and transplanting single seedlings/hill are major elements of SRI methodology. These findings contribute to an understanding of why SRI methods can produce the higher yields reported. A consideration of the effects of interaction between planting pattern and water regime shows the need to establish empirically the optimum values for these treatments according to varietal, soil and climatic characteristics for the greatest yield response.

AB Ecosystem resilience to climate anomalies is related to the physiological plasticity of organisms. To characterize the physiological response of some common Mediterranean gorgonians to fluctuations in temperature, four species (Paramuricea clavata, Eunicella singularis, Eunicella cavolinii and Corallium rubrum) were maintained in aquaria, in which the temperature was increased every ten days with increments of 2-3 degrees C, starting at 14 degrees C, ending at 25 degrees C. Oxygen consumption, number of open/closed polyps and percentage of necrotic tissue were monitored. All species showed similar activity patterns with increasing temperature. P. clavata and E. singularis showed the highest respiration rate at 18 degrees C, E. cavolinii and C rubrum at 20 degrees C. Above these temperatures, both oxygen consumption and polyp reactivity decreased in all species. The present data confirm a reduction of the metabolic activity in Mediterranean gorgonians during periods of high temperature. At temperatures above 18 degrees C, the percentage of open polyps (considered as a parameter to evaluate polyps reactivity) decreased, thus mirroring the trend of oxygen consumption. The average values of Q(10) indicated that gorgonians have a definite temperature limit over which the metabolism (oxygen consumption) stop to follow the temperature increase. After three days at 25 degrees C, metabolic activity in E. cavolinii, C. rubrum and P. clavata further decreased and the first signs of necrosis were observed. At this temperature, activity remained unchanged in E. singularis. This species seems to more resistant to thermal stress. The symbiotic zooxanthellae present in this species are likely to provide an alternative source of energy when polyps reduce their feeding activity. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB P>1. The role of genetic factors in species decline and extinction is the subject of a long-running controversy, with demographical factors often seen as more important for the immediate persistence of populations and species. One gene system that directly links genetic diversity with reproduction, through its influence on fertilization success, is the self-incompatibility (SI) locus in angiosperm plants. Despite the potential importance of SI allele diversity for demographical function, there are few direct measures of S-allele numbers in multiple populations, and no studies have simultaneously measured reproductive output, mate availability, S-allele diversity and pollinator service.
   2. We used diallel crosses to estimate S-allele number and mate availability in seven populations of the forb Rutidosis leptorrhynchoides ranging in size from 5 to 100 000 plants. Seed set and correlated paternity were assessed from open-pollinated inflorescences to examine reproductive output and variance in female and male fitness. To assess whether populations were receiving adequate pollinator service, the amount of pollen deposited on open-pollinated stigmas was quantified.
   3. We found that small populations (< 100 plants) of R. leptorrhynchoides have low S-allele diversity and mate availability and exhibit significant reductions in seed set relative to large populations (> 1000 plants) with higher numbers of S-alleles, despite the maintenance of pollinator service. Greater variance in seed set among plants and higher correlated paternity in small populations suggest that low S-allele numbers are directly limiting mate availability and causing the observed reproductive failure.
   4. Synthesis and applications. Our work demonstrates that the loss of genetic diversity at the SI locus can have immediate detrimental effects on reproductive performance, despite the maintenance of pollinator service. These results highlight the importance of genetic factors in determining demographical outcomes when clear links between genotype and individual fitness exist, even when populations are not ecologically constrained. This result is important for the conservation and management of many plant species as approximately half of all angiosperm families contain species with genetically controlled SI and the loss of genetic diversity through habitat loss and fragmentation is an ever-increasing reality for plant species worldwide.

AB Naturally occurring unisexual reproduction has been documented in less than 0.1% of all vertebrate species. Among vertebrates, true parthenogenesis is known only in squamate reptiles. In all vertebrate cases that have been carefully studied, the clonal or hemiclonal taxa have originated through hybridization between closely related sexual species. In contrast, parthenogenetic reproduction has arisen in invertebrates by a variety of mechanisms, including likely cases of "spontaneous" (nonhybrid) origin, a situation not currently documented in natural populations of vertebrates. Here, we present molecular data from the Neotropical night lizard genus Lepidophyma that provides evidence of independent nonhybrid origins for diploid unisexual populations of two species from Costa Rica and Panama Our mitochondrial and nuclear phylogenies are congruent with respect to the unisexual taxa. Based on 14 microsatellite loci, heterozygosity (expected from a hybrid origin) is low in Lepidophyma reticulatum and completely absent in unisexual L. flavimaculatum. The unique value of this system will allow direct comparative studies between parthenogenetic and sexual lineages in vertebrates, with an enormous potential for this species to be a model system for understanding the mechanisms of nonhybrid parthenogenesis.

AB Our ability to predict consequences of climate change is severely impaired by the lack of knowledge on the ability of species to adapt to changing environmental conditions. We used distribution data for 140 mammal species in Europe, together with data on climate, land cover and topography, to derive a statistical description of their realized climate niche. We then compared climate niche overlap of pairs of species, selected on the basis of phylogenetic information. In contrast to expectations, related species were not similar in their climate niche. Rather, even species pairs that had a common ancestor less than 1 Ma already display very high climate niche distances. We interpret our finding as a strong interspecific competitive constraint on the realized niche, rather than a rapid evolution of the fundamental niche. If correct, our results imply a very limited usefulness of climate niche models for the prediction of future mammal distributions.

AB Fishery-management policies based on the allocation of exclusive fishing rights, territorial use rights, and sea zoning are recurrent tools for achieving sustainability. In Chile, the 1991 Fishery and Aquaculture Law reformed division of the right to fish between the artisan and industrial subsectors, introduced sea-zoning (space-based) strategies, and established a differential individual transferable quota (ITQ) system. Here, I describe these arrangements and focus on the small-pelagic artisan and industrial purse-seine fishery. Results show that the reform and empowerment of the artisan fishers, due to new governance, has lead to increases in the artisan fleet and landings but to decreases for the industrial sector. The reform appears to have counteracted the inherent "race for fish" characteristic of common-pool resources in open-access systems.

AB The accuracy and precision of four single-sample estimators of effective population size, N(e) (heterozygote excess, linkage disequilibrium, Bayesian partial likelihood and sibship analysis) were compared using empirical data (microsatellite genotypes) from multiple natterjack toad (Bufo calamita) populations in Britain (n = 16) and elsewhere in Europe (n = 10). Census size data were available for the British populations. Because toads have overlapping generations, all of these methods estimated the number of effective breeders N(b) rather than N(e). The heterozygote excess method only provided results, without confidence limits, for nine of the British populations. Linkage disequilibrium gave estimates for 10 British populations, but only six had finite confidence limits. The Bayesian and sibship methods both produced estimates with finite confidence limits for all the populations. Although the Bayesian method was the most precise, on most criteria (insensitivity to locus number, correlation with other effective and census size estimates and correlation with genetic diversity) the sibship method performed best. The results also provided evidence of genetic compensation in natterjack toads, and highlighted how the relationship between effective size and genetic diversity can vary as a function of geographical scale.

AB South Africa is home to a wide variety of marine flora and fauna distributed over at least three biogeographic provinces. Currently, 9% of the coastline is protected by 'no-take' marine protected areas (MPAs), but the distribution of MPAs is uneven between regions. This paper argues that in order for an MPA network to be effective, single MPAs need to be connected to function as part of a larger ecosystem. Methods such as larval surveys, biodiversity assessments and fish tagging are not always successful at elucidating connectivity between areas. Molecular tools addressing population genetics can additionally be successfully employed to assess genetic structuring, gene flow and connectivity between areas of a coastline. Data for southern African rocky shore and estuarine species show several patterns, such as genetic breaks across Cape Point, Cape Agulhas, east of Port Elizabeth and on the northern KwaZulu-Natal coast. Several areas of genetic interest, those including high genetic diversity of commercially exploited species, are highlighted for future conservation efforts.

AB The resilience of Symbiodinium harboured by corals is dependent on the genetic diversity and extent of connectivity among reef populations. This study presents genetic analyses of Great Barrier Reef (GBR) populations of clade C Symbiodinium hosted by the alcyonacean coral, Sinularia flexibilis. Allelic variation at four newly developed microsatellite loci demonstrated that Symbiodinium populations are genetically differentiated at all spatial scales from 16 to 1,360 km (pairwise I broken vertical bar(ST) = 0.01-0.47, mean = 0.22); the only exception being two neighbouring populations in the Cairns region separated by 17 km. This indicates that gene flow is restricted for Symbiodinium C hosted by S. flexibilis on the GBR. Patterns of population structure reflect longshore circulation patterns and limited cross-shelf mixing, suggesting that passive transport by currents is the primary mechanism of dispersal in Symbiodinium types that are acquired horizontally. There was no correlation between the genetic structure of Symbiodinium populations and their host S. flexibilis, most likely because different factors affect the dispersal and recruitment of each partner in the symbiosis. The genetic diversity of these Symbiodinium reef populations is on average 1.5 times lower on inshore reefs than on offshore reefs. Lower inshore diversity may reflect the impact of recent bleaching events on Sinularia assemblages, which have been more widespread and severe on inshore reefs, but may also have been shaped by historical sea level fluctuations or recent migration patterns.

AB Common aims of habitat studies are to differentiate between (i) suitable and unsuitable sites for a given species, and (ii) sites used by different communities of species. To quantify differences between sites, field data of site use must be precise enough that true underlying between-site variability is not masked by within-site measurement error. We designed a pilot study to guide the development of a survey protocol for a habitat study on bats in an agricultural landscape in southeastern Australia. Three woodland sites and two scattered tree sites of 2 ha each were surveyed for nine consecutive nights. At three locations within each site (spaced > 50 m apart) one or two Anabat detectors were mounted 1 m above ground or in a tree (2 m above ground). We used mixed regression models to quantify multiple sources of variability in bat calling activity, and graphical data analysis to visualise how increases in survey effort were likely to affect inference. For the five most active species, we found that typically over 40% of variability in nightly detections occurred at the between-site level; approximately 10% occurred between locations within sites; approximately 20% was explained by night-to-night differences; and approximately 30% of variability was not attributable to systematic variation within experimental units. Differences in community composition between sites were clearly evident when two or more detectors per site were used for four or more nights. We conclude with six general considerations for the design of effective habitat studies. These are to (i) consider key contrasts of interest; (ii) use data from mild, calm, dry nights only; (iii) calibrate detectors; (iv) use multiple detectors where possible, or move a single detector within a site; (v) survey for multiple nights; and (vi) where vertical differentiation in habitat use is likely, mount detectors at different heights. These considerations need to be balanced within the context of financial and logistical constraints.

AB Predator-prey interactions are of eminent importance as structuring forces for animal communities. The present study investigates if and how strongly the density of soil microarthropods is controlled by top-down forces, i.e. predation by mesostigmate mites (Mesostigmata, Acari). We set up a laboratory experiment running for ten weeks with undisturbed soil cores taken from the field using two densities of predatory mesostigmate mites: (1) ambient density (control) and (2) increased density (addition of seven Pergamasus septentrionalis and eight Lysigamasus sp. individuals). Increased predator density resulted in a decrease in the density of Oribatida, Collembola and Protura whereas the density of other taxa including Astigmata, Prostigmata and Uropodina was not significantly affected. Additionally, the species number of Oribatida was also not significantly affected. Taxa of Oribatida and Collembola were differently affected by increased predator density. Among Collembola, densities of Poduridae and Sminthuridae were reduced, whereas Entomobryidae were not affected. Among Oribatida, densities of Oppiidae and Suctobelbidae were reduced whereas Desmonomata, Poronota and Tectocepheus were not affected. Grouping of Oribatida into different size classes and into classes differing in sclerotization suggests that smaller mites (200-300 mu m) and mites with less sclerotization were more heavily affected than larger mites and mites with strong sclerotization. The results indicate that predatory mesostigmate mites have the potential to control the density of certain taxa of soil microarthropods. In particular, small and little sclerotized prey is susceptible to predator control indicating that predator defense is an important component of the life history tactics of soil microarthropods, especially of Oribatida.

AB Nutrient and water management is crucially important in shallow-rooted vegetable production systems characterized by high input and high environmental risk. A 2-year field experiment on greenhouse cucumber double-cropping systems examined the effects of root zone nitrogen management and planting of sweet corn as a catch crop in the summer fallow period on cucumber yield and soil N-min dynamics compared to conventional practices. Cucumber fruit yields were not significantly affected by root zone N management and catch crop planting despite a decrease in N fertilizer application of 53% compared to conventional N management. Soil Nmin content to a depth of 0.9 m decreased markedly and root zone (0-0.3 m) soil Nmin content was maintained at about 200 kg N ha(-1). Root zone N management efficiently and directly reduced apparent N losses by 44% and 45% in 2005 and 2006, respectively. Sweet corn, the summer catch crop, depleted Nmin residue in the soil profile of 1.8 m at harvest of winter-spring season cucumber by 304-333 kg N ha(-1), which contributed 19-22% reduction in N loss. Compared to conventional N management, N loss was reduced by 56% under root zone N management and catch crop planting.

AB The fine-scale ecological determinants for wood-inhabiting aphyllophoroid basidiomycetes were investigated with statistical analyses of the occurrence of fruit bodies on woody debris collected in Switzerland and Ukraine. Three substrate descriptors were considered: diameter, degree of decomposition to those local environmental descriptors were detected. Three classes for diameter, as well as for degree of decomposition were thus delimited. They revealed the importance of very small sizes, which were not reported in the literature so far: the relevant diameter class limits were about 0.72 cm and 1.35 cm. Within the host tree species, a clear distinction between coniferous and broadleaf species was found. The next splits followed rather climatic determinants of tree distribution than taxonomical entities such as families or genera. The fidelity of the 59 fungal species to diameter classes, decomposition classes and host tree species was measured by the Dufrene-Legendre index and only significant responses after permutation tests were retained. This brought new insights on the ecology of many wood-inhabiting aphyllophoroid basidiomycetes. Redundancy Analysis was applied to investigate the response of fungal species to diameter and degree of decompostion of woody debris from the most common host tree species, Fagus sylvatica. This direct gradient analysis made it possible to reconstruct the succession of fungal species along the wood decomposition process.

AB Since evolutionary processes, such as dispersal, adaptation and drift, occur in a geographical context, at multiple hierarchical levels, biogeography provides a central and important unifying framework for understanding the patterns of distribution of life on Earth. However, the advent of molecular markers has allowed a clearer evaluation of the relationships between microevolutionary processes and patterns of genetic divergence among populations in geographical space, triggering the rapid development of many research programmes. Here we provide an overview of the interpretation of patterns of genetic diversity in geographical and ecological space, using both implicit and explicit spatial approaches. We discuss the actual or potential interaction of phylogeography, molecular ecology, ecological genetics, geographical genetics, landscape genetics and conservation genetics with biogeography, identifying their respective roles and their ability to deal with ecological and evolutionary processes at different levels of the biological hierarchy. We also discuss how each of these research programmes can improve strategies for biodiversity conservation. A unification of these research programmes is needed to better achieve their goals, and to do this it is important to develop cross-disciplinary communication and collaborations among geneticists, ecologists, biogeographers and spatial statisticians.

AB Throughout its native range, the Yellowstone cutthroat trout (YCT), Oncorhynchus clarkii bouvieri, is declining dramatically in both abundance and distribution as a result of introgression with introduced rainbow trout (RBT), O. mykiss. We sampled over 1,200 trout from the South Fork of the Snake River (SFSR) watershed, in southeastern Idaho and western Wyoming, and measured the extent of introgression of RBT genes into native gene pools of YCT using seven species-specific, co-dominant nuclear genetic markers. We also used mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplotype differences between the two parental trout species to determine the directionality of the hybridization. We found low levels of RBT introgression (only 7% of sampled individuals had one or more RBT alleles) into YCT gene pools, with the majority of hybrids (78%) occurring in mainstem localities of the SFSR and in lower elevation reaches of certain tributaries. Hybridization was bidirectional with respect to mtDNA haplotype, but the majority of hybrids (75%) had YCT maternal haplotypes, indicative of the greater proportion (90%) of YCT-genotypes in the SFSR watershed. The primary factor influencing the geographic distribution of RBT introgressed individuals was fluvial distance from localities of stocking origin. To a lesser extent, elevation, also influenced the distribution of hybrid genotypes, with several entire tributaries and all upper elevation reaches within tributaries harboring only YCT-genotypes. Important management implications of the study suggest targeting particular tributaries and upper reaches within tributaries for YCT protection and exclusion of RBT hybrid colonization.

AB The evolutionary potential of a population is closely related to two key population genetic parameters, namely the effective population size (N-e) and migration rate (m). Furthermore, knowledge of these parameters is required in order to assess potential constraints on local adaptation and for the development of biologically sound management strategies. We addressed these key issues by investigating the temporal and spatial genetic structure of over 2000 adult Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) collected from 17 sites in the Teno and Naatamo rivers in northernmost Europe with up to five time points spanning temporal intervals up to 24 years (similar to 4 generations). In all cases except one, local populations were found to be temporally stable within the river system. Estimates of N-e were generally a magnitude larger for the mainstem and headwater populations (MS+ HW, N-e similar to 340-1200) than for the tributary populations (N-e similar to 35 160), thus explaining the higher genetic diversity and lower divergence of the MS+ HW populations compared to tributaries. The overall migration rates to tributaries were low, and in some cases, low enough for local adaptations to potentially evolve, despite their lower N-e. Signs of a population bottleneck and natural recruitment from nearby populations were detected in one local population. This highlights a fact which is relevant for the conservation and management of highly substructured population systems in general: that even when the overall census size is large, local populations can be vulnerable to perturbations. To preserve the current and to regain the historical distribution of salmon within the river system, we propose that the status of the total population complex should be evaluated at the local population level rather than from descriptive statistics at the system level.

AB Depending on such factors as the intensity and duration of the exposure, and the genetic diversity and connectedness of the starting population, exposure to elevated metal concentrations can result in population level alterations such as demographic bottlenecks or metal-induced selection. These processes can be revealed using a population genetic approach, and have important implications with respect to population persistence. The main objective of this study was to examine the role of metal contamination in driving evolutionary changes by documenting patterns of genetic diversity within and among populations of wild yellow perch (Perca flavescens) in two major mining regions that have been subjected to metal emissions from smelters for at least 80 years; Rouyn-Noranda, Quebec and Sudbury, Ontario. Yellow perch populations from ten lakes representing a gradient of metal contamination in each of the two lake systems were evaluated concurrently to reveal relationships between metal contamination and genetic diversity. These replicated sympatric observations allowed us to evaluate correlations and infer causal relationships between metal exposure and evolutionary responses in this species. Within-population gene diversity over all loci was negatively correlated with liver cadmium contamination (P < 0.001; r(2) = 0.47). Similarly, a negative correlation between gene diversity and liver copper contamination was observed at a single locus (Pfla L1, P = 0.005; r(2) = 0.33), suggesting a local effect of copper contamination. Internal relatedness, an index of individual diversity, presented the opposite tendency as the more contaminated individuals were more diverse than were the less contaminated ones in contaminated and reference populations. Our results thus suggest that the selective response to contamination has been large enough to substantially reduce the within-population genetic diversity, despite the fact that the less inbred individuals may be favoured by selection within any given population. Overall, our results reveal that >50 years of metal contamination have significantly impacted patterns of genetic diversity observed among populations of wild yellow perch in mining areas and as such, may have affected the capacity of populations to respond to future environmental changes.

AB Coral reefs are under threat due to climate-mediated coral mortality, which affects some reef coral genera more severely than others. The impact this has on coral reef fish is receiving increasing attention, with one focal area assessing impacts on fish that feed directly on live coral. It appears that the more specialised a species of corallivore, the more susceptible it is to coral declines. However data are sparse for the Indian Ocean, and little is known about why some corals are preferentially fed upon over others. Here I assess feeding specialisation in three species of coral feeding butterflyfish in the Chagos Archipelago, central Indian Ocean, assess the food quality of the coral genera they target and document patterns of decline in the Seychelles following a severe coral mortality event. Cheatodon trifascialis was the most specialised coral feeder, preferentially selecting for Acropora corals, however, when Acropora was scarce, individuals showed considerable feeding plasticity, particularly for the dominant Pocillopora corals. C. trifasciatus also preferentially fed on Acropora corals, but fed on a much more diverse suite of corals and also displayed some selectivity for Porites. C. auriga is a facultative corallivore and consumed similar to 55% live coral, which lies within the wide range of coral dependence reported for this species. C:N ratio analysis indicated Lobophyllia and Acropora have the highest food quality, with Pocillopora having the lowest, which conforms with diet selection of corallivores and helps explain preferential feeding. Obligate specialist feeders displayed the greatest declines through coral mortality in the Seychelles with obligate generalists also declining substantially, but facultative feeders showing little change. Clearly a greater understanding of the species most vulnerable to disturbance, their habitat requirements and the functional roles they play will greatly assist biodiversity conservation in a changing climate.

AB To understand the success of invasive species, it is important to know whether colonization events are facilitated by adaptive evolution or are limited to sites where a species is pre-adapted to thrive. Studies of the ancient colonization patterns of an invader in its native range provide an opportunity to examine its natural history of adaptation and colonization. This study uses molecular (internal transcribed spacer sequence and amplified fragment length polymorphism) and common garden approaches to assess the ancient patterns of establishment and quantitative trait evolution in the invasive shrub Hypericum canariense. This species has an unusually small and discrete native range in the Canary Islands. Our data reveal two genetic varieties with divergent life histories and different colonization patterns across the islands. Although molecular divergence within each variety is large (pairwise F-ST from 0.18 to 0.32 between islands) and nearly as great as divergence between them, life-history traits show striking uniformity within varieties. The discrepancy between molecular and life-history trait divergence points to the action of stabilizing selection within varieties and the influence of pre-adaptation on patterns of colonization. The colonization history of H. canariense reflects how the relationship between selective environments in founding and source populations can dictate establishment by particular lineages and their subsequent evolutionary stasis or change.

AB Orobanche crenata is a weedy root parasite that causes huge damage to legume crops. Control strategies have centred around agronomic practices and the use of herbicides, although success has been marginal. Our field experiments show that O. crenata infection on faba bean and pea is reduced when these host crops are intercropped with oat. The number of O. crenata plants per host plant decreased as the proportion of oats increased in the intercrop. Pot and rhizotron experiments confirmed the reduction of infection in faba bean intercropped with cereals. It is suggested that inhibition of O. crenata seed germination by allelochemicals released by cereal roots is the mechanism for reduction of O. crenata infection. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The red-backed shrike (Lanius collurio L.) is a bird living in human-altered agricultural areas that are managed by extensive farming techniques. This passerine species has declined significantly in Western Europe over the last 30-40 years. The development of efficient species-specific conservation strategies relies on fine-grained information about the ecological resources and environmental conditions that constitute its reproductive habitat in this agricultural landscape. Species distribution models are used increasingly in conservation biology to provide such information. Most studies investigate the environmental pattern of species distribution, assuming that species records are reliable indicators of habitat suitability. However, ecological theory on source-sink dynamics and ecological traps points out that some individuals may be located outside the environmental bounds of their species' reproductive niche. Those individuals could reduce model accuracy and limit model utility. Parameters related to the reproductive success of this shrike in Southern Belgium were integrated into a fine-scale presence-only modelling framework to demonstrate this problem and to address critical habitat requirements of this species relative to conservation management. Integrating reproductive parameters into the modelling framework showed that individuals occurred, but did not reproduce successfully, above a certain environmental threshold. This indicated that the reproductive niche of the shrike is ecologically narrower than standard practice in species distribution modelling would suggest. The major resources (nest sites availability, distance to human settlements, suitable perching sites, foraging areas and insect abundance) required for the reproduction of the red-backed shrike were quantified and ranked to offer concrete species -specific conservation management guidelines.

AB The family Mustelidae, which consists of Mustelinae, Lutrinae, Melinae, and Taxidiinae, is the largest family among Carnivora and is a highly diverse group. Recent molecular phylogenetic studies have clarified the phylogenetic relations among Mustelidae, but there remain several unresolved problems, particularly concerning the deep branchings. Whereas many studies support the monophyly of Mustelidae+Procyonidae among Musteloidea, the relations between Mustelidae+Procyonidae, Ailuridae, and Miphitidae are still unclear. To address these problems, we inferred a tree on the basis of the sequences of mitochondrial genomes and of multiple nuclear genes using the maximum likelihood method. Our results strongly support the hypothesis that the Taxidiinae branched at first, followed by the branching of the Melinae. After that, Mustelinae diversified, and Lutrinae evolved within Mustelinae. With respect to the deep branchings in Musteloidea, the Ailuridae/Mephitidae monophyly tree and the Mephitidae-basal tree are indistinguishable in log-likelihood score, and this problem remains unresolved.

AB For conservation purposes islands are considered safe refuges for many species, particularly in regions where introduced predators form a major threat to the native fauna, but island populations are also known to possess low levels of genetic diversity. The New Zealand archipelago provides an ideal system to compare genetic diversity of large mainland populations where introduced predators are common, to that of smaller offshore islands, which serve as predator-free refuges. We assessed microsatellite variation in South Island robins (Petroica australis australis), and compared large mainland, small mainland, natural island and translocated island populations. Large mainland populations exhibited more polymorphic loci and higher number of alleles than small mainland and natural island populations. Genetic variation did not differ between natural and translocated island populations, even though one of the translocated populations was established with five individuals. Hatching failure was recorded in a subset of the populations and found to be significantly higher in translocated populations than in a large mainland population. Significant population differentiation was largely based on heterogeneity in allele frequencies (including fixation of alleles), as few unique alleles were observed. This study shows that large mainland populations retain higher levels of genetic diversity than natural and translocated island populations. It highlights the importance of protecting these mainland populations and using them as a source for new translocations. In the future, these populations may become extremely valuable for species conservation if existing island populations become adversely affected by low levels of genetic variation and do not persist.

AB Landscape optimization for biodiversity requires prediction of species distributions under alternative revegetation scenarios. We used Bayesian model averaging with logistic regression to predict probabilities of occurrence for 61 species of birds within highly fragmented box-ironbark forests of central Victoria, Australia. We used topographic, edaphic, and climatic variables as predictors so that the models could be applied to areas where vegetation has been cleared but may be replanted. Models were evaluated with newly acquired, independent data collected in large blocks of remnant native vegetation. Successful predictions were obtained for 18 of 45 woodland species (40%). Model averaging produced more accurate predictions than "single best" models. Models were most successful for smaller-bodied species that probably depend on particular vegetation types. Predictions for larger, generalist species, and seasonal migrants were less successful, partly because of changes in species distributions between model building (1995-1997) and validation (2004-2005) surveys. We used validated models to project occurrence probabilities for individual species across a 12,000-km(2) region, assuming native vegetation was present. These predictions are intended to be used as inputs, along with landscape context and temporal dynamics, into optimization algorithms to prioritize revegetation. Longer-term data sets to accommodate temporal dynamics are needed to improve the predictive accuracy of models.

AB Extreme events (hurricanes, floods, and droughts) can influence upstream migration of macroinvertebrates and wash out benthic communities, thereby locally altering food webs and species interactions. We sampled palaemonid river shrimp (Macrobrachium spp.), dominant consumers in headwaters of the Luquillo Mountains of northeastern Puerto Rico, to determine their distributions along an elevational gradient (274-456 m asl) during a series of disturbances (Hurricane Hugo in 1989, a drought in 1994, and Hurricane Georges in 1998) that occurred over a 15-y period (1988-2002). We measured shrimp abundance 3 to 6 times/y in Quebrada Prieta in the Espiritu Santo drainage as part of the Luquillo Long-Term Ecological Research Program. In general, Macrobrachium abundance declined with elevation during most years. The lowest mean abundance of Macrobrachium occurred during the 1994 drought, the driest year in 28 y of record in the Espiritu Santo drainage. Macrobrachium increased in abundance for 6 y following the 1994 drought. In contrast, hurricanes and storm flows had relatively little effect on Macrobrachium abundance.

AB It has been hypothesized that in ancient apomictic, nonrecombining lineages the two alleles of a single copy gene will become highly divergent as a result of the independent accumulation of mutations (Meselson effect). We used a partial sequence of the elongation factor-1 alpha (ef-1 alpha) and the heat shock protein 82 (hsp82) genes to test this hypothesis for putative ancient parthenogenetic oribatid mite lineages. In addition, we tested if the hsp82 gene is fully transcribed by sequencing the cDNA and we also tested if there is evidence for recombination and gene conversion in sexual and parthenogenetic oribatid mite species. The average maximum intra-specific divergence in the ef-1 alpha was 2.7% in three parthenogenetic species and 8.6% in three sexual species; the average maximum intra-individual genetic divergence was 0.9% in the parthenogenetic and 6.0% in the sexual species. In the hsp82 gene the average maximum intra-individual genetic divergence in the sexual species Steganacarus magnus and in the parthenogenetic species Platynothrus peltifer was 1.1% and 1.2%, respectively. None of the differences were statistically significant. The cDNA data indicated that the hsp82 sequence is transcribed and intron-free. Likelihood permutation tests indicate that ef-1 alpha has undergone recombination in all three studied sexual species and gene conversion in two of the sexual species, but neither process has occurred in any of the parthenogenetic species. No evidence for recombination or gene conversion was found for sexual or parthenogenetic oribatid mite species in the hsp 82 gene. There appears to be no Meselson effect in parthenogenetic oribatid mite species. Presumably, their low genetic divergence is due to automixis, other homogenizing mechanisms or strong selection to keep both the ef-1 alpha and the hsp82 gene functioning.

AB The spiny lobster Palinurus gilchristi is endemic to the deep shelf waters along the southern coast of South Africa, where it supports a commercial fishery. Mark-recapture studies and phenotypic differences suggest there are 2 populations of this species along the coast, but it is unknown if the observed differences have arisen because of low gene flow and subsequent genetic differentiation. To investigate population structure and the physical processes that may have influenced gene flow, a portion of the mitochondrial DNA control region was sequenced for 187 lobsters across the entire range of the species. An analysis of molecular variance showed no significant genetic difference between the 2 putative populations. A mismatch distribution and Fu's F-s test indicated that this species has undergone a fairly recent demographic expansion (population size and geographic range). The genetic structure of this species could be panmictic due to a high amount of gene flow between the 2 regions during the larval stage, when the larvae are carried downstream by the Agulhas Current. Furthermore, the lack of genetic differences between the 2 putative populations could be the result of a recent demographic expansion accompanied by low diversity of haplotypes produced by a leading edge effect from the expansion.

AB Since European settlement, mainland Australia has experienced a wave of mammal extinctions and population declines. However, some species have persisted on off-shore islands, which are now viewed as important wildlife refuges. In this study, we assessed the level of genetic diversity, at 7-11 microsatellite loci, in island and remnant mainland populations of three endemic species of macropodid marsupial; the tammar wallaby Macropus eugenii (n = 92); rufous hare-wallaby Lagorchestes hirsutus (n = 40) and black-footed rock-wallaby Petrogale lateralis ( n 164). There was a consistent pattern of significantly higher levels of microsatellite diversity in the remnant mainland population (A = 4.9-13.9; He = 0.61-0.86) of each species compared to conspecific "pristine" island populations (A = 1.2-3.7; He = 0.05-0.44). These marked differences are even apparent where island populations currently have a substantially larger census size. In addition, island populations were substantially inbred (Fe = 0.49-0.91). Although island populations have been insulated from the relatively recent threatening processes operating on the mainland, they have nevertheless been significantly impacted by increased inbreeding and the substantial erosion of genetic diversity. Despite the difficulties of ensuring the survival of remnant mainland populations, they appear to retain substantially more genetic diversity than their island counterparts and therefore are more likely to contribute to the long-term persistence of their species. These data also demonstrate that small remnant mainland populations (n < 10-20) are often capable of rapid recovery and are not necessarily genetically depauperate.

AB Demographic density dependence is essential for regulating population dynamics. For populations with multiple age or size cohorts, interactions between cohorts may be an important source of density dependence. Between-cohort interactions may be especially intense for many marine fish populations because of the potential disparity in competitive ability between small new recruits and relatively large resident conspecifics. Indeed, for marine fishes, density dependence in local populations appears to be widespread, particularly during a crucial time period following settlement of larvae into juvenile and adult habitats. I tested whether the demography of newly settled juveniles of the planktivorous fairy basslet (Gramma loreto) was affected by the density of adult conspecifics. Using spatially isolated local populations on coral reefs in the Bahamas, I experimentally transplanted a cohort of juveniles to local populations with three treatments of adult density: adults absent, average adult density, and high adult density (twice average). By following the fate of the transplanted juveniles, I determined that juvenile mortality increased as a function of adult density. Juveniles did not experience significantly higher rates of aggression or lower growth at higher densities of adults. However, in the presence of adults, juveniles generally fed at the back of aggregations, where feeding rates tend to be lower. Automated time-lapse video revealed that predators were found most frequently toward the back of aggregations. Thus competition with adults for prime feeding positions may increase predation risk for juveniles by forcing them to overlap spatially with predators. Consequently, interactions between juveniles and adults could influence the demography of subsequent generations in ways that promote local population regulation.

AB Symbiotic relationships have contributed greatly to the evolution and maintenance of biological diversity. On the Great Barrier Reef, species of obligate coral-dwelling fishes (genus Gobiodon) coexist by selectively recruiting to colonies of Acropora nasuta that differ in branch-tip colour. In this study, we investigate genetic variability among sympatric populations of two colour morphs of A. nasuta ('blue-tip' and 'brown-tip') living in symbiosis with two fish species, Gobiodon histrio and G. quinquestrigatus, respectively, to determine whether gobies are selecting between intraspecific colour polymorphisms or cryptic coral species. We also examine genetic differentiation among coral populations containing both these colour morphs that are separated by metres between local sites, tens of kilometres across the continental shelf and hundreds of kilometres along the Great Barrier Reef. We use three nuclear DNA loci, two of which we present here for the first time for Acropora. No significant genetic differentiation was detected between sympatric colour morphs at these three loci. Hence, symbiotic gobies are selecting among colour morphs of A. nasuta, rather than cryptic species. Significant genetic geographical structuring was observed among populations, independent of colour, at regional (i.e. latitudinal separation by < 500 km) and cross-shelf (< 50 km) scales, alongside relative homogeneity between local populations on within reef scales (< 5 km). This contrasts with the reported absence of large-scale genetic structuring in A. valida, which is a member of the same species group as A. nasuta. Apparent differences in biogeographical structuring between species within the A. nasuta group emphasize the need for comparative sampling across both spatial (i.e. within reefs, between reefs and between regions) and taxonomic scales (i.e. within and between closely related species).

AB One-year-old grapevines (Vitis labrusca L. 'Concord') were supplied twice weekly for 5 weeks with 0, 5,10,15, or 20 mm nitrogen (N) in a modified Hoagland's solution to generate a wide range of leaf N status. Both light-saturated CO2 assimilation at ambient CO2 and at saturating CO, increased curvilinearly as leaf N increased. Although stomatal conductance showed a similar response to leaf N as CO, assimilation, calculated intercellular CO, concentrations decreased. On a leaf area basis, activities of key enzymes in the Calvin cycle, ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco), NADP-glyceraidehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), phosphoribulokinase (PRK), and key enzymes in sucrose and starch synthesis, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase), sucrose phosphate synthase (SPS), and ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (AGPase), increased linearly with increasing leaf N content. When expressed on a leaf N basis, activities of the Calvin cycle enzymes increased with increasing leaf N, whereas activities of FBPase, SPS, and AGPase did not show significant change. As leaf N increased, concentrations of glucose-6-phosphate (G6P), fructose-6-phosphate (F6P), and 3-phosphoglycerate (PGA) increased curvilinearly. The ratio of G6P/F6P remained unchanged over the leaf N range except for a significant drop at the lowest leaf N. Concentrations of glucose, fructose, and sucrose at dusk increased linearly with increasing leaf N, and there was no difference between predawn and dusk measurements. As leaf N increased, starch concentration increased linearly at dusk, but decreased linearly at predawn. The calculated carbon export from starch degradation during the night increased with increasing leaf N. These results showed that 1) grapes leaves accumulated less soluble carbohydrates under N-limitation; 2) the elevated starch level in low N leaves at predawn was the result of the reduced carbon export from starch degradation during the night; and 3) the reduced capacity of CO2 assimilation in low N leaves was caused by the coordinated decreases in the activities of key enzymes involved in CO2 assimilation as a result of direct N limitation, not by the indirect feedback repression of CO2 assimilation via sugar accumulation.

AB The effect of salinity on nitrate influx, efflux, nitrate net uptake rate and net nitrogen translocation to the shoot was assessed in a N-15 steady state labelling experiment in the halophyte Plantago maritima L. raised for 14 days on solution supplied with 50, 100 and 200 mol m(-3) sodium chloride or without sodium chloride. Additionally, salinity induced changes in root morphology were determined. Specific root length increased upon exposure to elevated sodium chloride concentrations due to variations in biomass allocation and length growth of the tap root. Changes in root morphology, however, had a minor effect on nitrate fluxes when expressed on a root fresh weight basis. The decreased rate of nitrate net uptake in plants grown on elevated levels of sodium chloride was almost entirely due to a decrease in nitrate influx. Expressed as a proportion of influx, nitrate efflux remained unchanged and was even lower at the highest salinity level. At all sodium chloride concentrations applied the initial rate of nitrogen net translocation to the shoot decreased relative to the rate of nitrate net uptake. It is concluded that under steady state conditions the negative effect of sodium chloride on the rate of nitrate net uptake at non growth-limiting salinity levels was due to the interaction between sodium chloride and nitrate transporters in the root plasma membrane and/or processes mediating the translocation of nitrogen compounds, possibly nitrate, to the shoot.

AB To understand the impact of various factors on the maintenance of genetic variation in natural populations, we need to focus on situations where at least some of these factors are removed or controlled. In this study, we used highly variable, presumably neutral, microsatellite and mtDNA markers to assess the nature of genetic variation in 14 island and two mainland populations of the Australian bush rat, where there is no migration between islands. Thus we are controlling for selection and gene flow. Both marker sets revealed low levels of diversity within the small island populations and extreme differentiation between populations. For six microsatellite loci, all of the small island populations had less genetic variation than the mainland populations; reduction in allelic diversity was more pronounced than loss of heterozygosity. Kangaroo Island, the large island population, had similar levels of diversity to the mainland populations. A 442 base pair (bp) section of the mtDNA control region was screened for variation by outgroup heteroduplex analysis/temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (OHA/TGGE). Only three of the 13 small island populations showed haplotypic diversity: Gambier (2), Waldegrave (2), and Eyere (3). The level of haplotypic diversity in the small island populations was similar to that on the mainland, most likely reflecting a recent population bottleneck on the mainland. In contrast, Kangaroo Island had 9 mtDNA haplotypes. The dominant factor influencing genetic diversity on the islands was island size. No correlation was detected between genetic diversity and the time since isolation or distance form the mainland. The combination of genetic drift within and complete isolation among the small island populations has resulted in rapid and extreme population divergence. Population pair-wise comparisons of allele frequency distributions showed significant differences for all populations for all loci (F-st = 0.11-0.84, R-st = 0.07-0.99). For the mtDNA control region, 92.6% of variation was apportioned between populations; only the Pearson islands shared a haplotype. Mantel tests of pair-wise genetic distance with pair-wise geographic distance showed no significant geographical clustering of haplotypes. However, population substructuring was detected within populations where sampling was conducted over a broader geographical range, as indicated by departures from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Thus substructuring in the ancestral population cannot be ruled out. The dominant evolutionary forces on the islands, after the initial founder event, are stochastic population processes such as genetic drift and mutation.

AB Evolutionary relationships among populations of chamois (Rupicapra spp.) across their current range from the Caucasus to the Cantabrian Mountains were investigated. The allelic variation in 23 microsatellite loci was assessed in eight geographical populations, recognised as subspecies of the two closely related species R. pyrenaica and R. rupicapra. Analysis of variance in allele frequencies (Fst, statistics) and in repeat numbers (Rst, statistics) showed these data to be highly structured. Two genetic distances between pairs of populations, Ds and (deltamu)(2), were computed and phylogenetic trees were constructed. Similar patterns were produced by the different statistics. All trees indicate a deep divergence between the two recognised species, which is compatible with archaeological data that place their split in the Riss-Wurm interglacial period. Genetic distances between pairs of populations are highly correlated with geographical distance. This suggests that the history of the genus during Pleistocene glacial-interglacial periods was dominated by expansions and contractions within limited geographic regions, leading to alternate contact and isolation of contiguous populations. In addition, the alpine barrier has played a substantial role in West-East differentiation. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved.

AB Commercial exploitation reduced the North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis) population from c. 12 000 in the 11th century to around 300 by the 21st century. We examine the effect of this population decline on levels of genetic variation at 16 microsatellite loci and contrast levels of variability to that in a closely related species (E. australis). Of the 13 loci developed from the E. glacialis genome, 100% were polymorphic in E. australis. In contrast, nine loci were polymorphic in E. glacialis and four were fixed. Both allelic diversity (A) and heterozygosity (H) were significantly lower in E. glacialis than E. australis (A = 3.2 +/- 2.6 vs. A = 6.9 +/- 3.3, P < 0.001; H = 0.31 +/- 0.25 vs. H = 0.72 +/- 0.23, P < 0.001, respectively). Bottleneck anlayses indicate that the population is in mutation-drift equilibrium and that a genetic bottleneck did not occur during the most recent decline (18th-20th centuries). Nevertheless, low frequency alleles are relatively uncommon in E. glacialis, suggesting that genetic variability has been reduced in this population. Possible origins of low genetic variability are discussed, including the slow but continual erosion of alleles during the 800-year period of decline.

AB Grevillea scapigera is one of the world's rarest plant species, currently known from only five plants in the wild. In 1995, 10 plants were selected from the 47 plants known at the time to act as genetically representative founders for translocation into secure sites. Ramets were micropropagated and introduced into one of these secure sites (Corrigin) in 1996, 1997, and 1998. By late 1998, 266 plants had been successfully translocated and were producing large numbers of seeds. With the development of an artificial seed-germination technique and because of an absence of seed germination in situ, seed was collected from these plants and germinated ex situ, and 161 seedlings were returned to the field site in winter 1999. We used the DNA fingerprinting technique of amplified fragment-length polymorphism (AFLP) to (1) assess the genetic fidelity of the clones through the propagation process, (2) contrast genetic variation and average genetic similarities of the F1s to their parents to assess genetic decline, and (3) assign paternity to the reintroduced seeds to assess the reproductive success of each clone. We found that 8 clones, not 10, were present in the translocated population, 54% of all plants were a single clone, and the F1s were on average 22% more inbred and 20% less heterozygous than their parents, largely because 85% of all seeds were the product of only 4 clones. Ultimately, effective population size (N-e) of the founding population was approximately two. Our results highlight the difficulty of maintaining genetic fidelity through a large translocation program. More generally, rapid genetic decline may be a feature of many translocated populations when N-e is small, which may ultimately threaten their long-term survival. Strategies to reverse this genetic decline include equalizing founder numbers, adding new genotypes when discovered, optimizing genetic structure and plant density to promote multiple siring and reduce kinship, promoting natural seed germination in situ rather than artificially germinating seeds ex situ, and creating a metapopulation of numerous translocated populations to restore historical distribution patterns and processes.

AB The two-spot ladybird beetle Adalia bipunctata (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) is host to four different intracellular maternally inherited bacteria that kill male hosts during embrygenesis: one each of the genus Rickettsia (alpha-Proteobacteria) and Spiroplasma (Mollicutes) and two distinct strains of Wolbachia (alpha-Proteobacteria). The history of infection with these male-killers was explored using host mitochondrial DNA, which is linked with the bacteria due to joint maternal inheritance. Two variable regions, 610 bp of cytochrome oxidase subunit I and 563 bp of NADH dehdrogenase subunit 5, were isolated from 52 A. bipunctata with known infection status and different geographic origin from across Eurasia. Two outgroup taxa were also considered. DNA sequence analysis revealed that the distribution of mitochondrial haplotypes is not associated with geography. Rather, it correlates with infection status, confirming linkage disequilibrium between mitochondria and bacteria. The data strongly suggest that the Rickettsia male-killer invaded the host earlier than the other taxa. Further, the male-killing Spiroplasma is indicated to have undergone a recent and extensive spread through host populations. In general, male-killing in A. bipunctata seems to represent a highly dynamic system, which should prove useful in future Studies on the evolutionary dynamics of this peculiar type of symbiont-host association.

AB A conservative estimate of the species tree for the woodpecker genus Picoides based on two mitochondrial protein-coding genes is tested using sequences of an independently evolving nuclear intron, G-fibrinogen intron 7. The mitochondrial gene-based topology and the intron-based topology are concordant, and a partition-homogeneity statistical test did not detect phylogenetic heterogeneity. The intron evolves more slowly than the mitochondrial sequences and tends not to resolve relationships among recently evolved species. However, the intron is superior over mitochondrial genes in resolving older bifurcations in the phylogeny. The two data sets were combined resulting in a robust estimate of the Picoides species tree in which most every node is statistically supported by bootstrap proportions. The Picoides species tree clearly shows that many morphological and behavioral characters used to lump species into this single genus have evolved by convergent evolution. Picoides is considered the largest genus of woodpeckers, but the molecular-based species tree suggests that Picoides is actually a conglomerate of several smaller groups.

AB Several researchers have hypothesized that, through various mechanisms, loss of species and functional group richness from a plant community will affect the magnitude and interannual variability of productivity. To test this hypothesis, I conducted a microcosm study of California grassland communities that differed in species richness. I grew cohorts of microcosms that simulated undisturbed grassland (in one year) and gopher-disturbed grassland (in two consecutive years). As the number of species per functional group decreased from 4 to 1, biomass production remained constant in all three cohorts. As species richness decreased from 16 to 1 (or 8 to 1, in either case including a drop in functional group richness), productivity declined in one of the cohorts. In this cohort, productivity of one polyculture marginally exceeded that of the most productive monoculture. Resource complementarity and a type of selection effect may have each contributed to the observed diversity-productivity relationships. Results suggest the existence of a selection effect that involves species that are highly productive in mixtures, rather than in monoculture. Over two seasons, species and functional group richness did not affect the interannual variability of biomass production, Comparisons of interannual changes in the productivity of monocultures and polycultures suggested that, in some polycultures, increased water availability might have relieved interspecific competition more than intraspecific competition. Based on results from this experiment and other manipulative experiments, I develop a framework to explain the relationship between species richness and productivity in terrestrial plant communities, The framework highlights the importance of environmental variation in shaping the diversity/productivity relationship.

AB The relative distributions of tree and crop roots in agroforestry associations may affect the degree of complementarity which can be achieved in their capture of below ground resources. Trees which root more deeply than crops may intercept leaching nitrogen and thus improve nitrogen use efficiency. This hypothesis was tested by injection of small doses of ((1)5NH(4))(2)SO4 at 21.8 atom% N-15 at different soil depths within established hedgerow intercropping systems on an Ultisol in Lampung, Indonesia. In the top 10 cm of soil in intercrops of maize and trees, root length density (L-rv) of maize was greater than that of Gliricidia sepium trees, which had greater L-rv in this topsoil layer than Peltophorum dasyrrachis trees. Peltophorum trees had a greater proportion of their roots in deeper soil layers than Gliricidia or maize. These vertical root distributions were related to the pattern of recovery of N-15 placed at different soil depths; more N-15 was recovered by maize and Gliricidia from placements at 5 cm depth than from placements at 45 or 65 cm depth. Peltophorum recovered similar amounts of N-15 from placements at each of these depths, and hence had a deeper N uptake distribution than Gliricidia or maize. Differences in tree L-rv across the cropping alley were comparatively small, and there was no significant difference (P <0.05) in the uptake of N-15 placed in topsoil at different distances from hedgerows. A greater proportion of the N-15 recovered by maize was found in grain following N-15 placement at 45 cm or 65 cm depth than following placement at 5 cm depth, reflecting the later arrival of maize roots in these deeper soil layers. Thus trees have an important role in preventing N leaching from subsoil during early crop establishment, although they themselves showed a lag phase in N-15 uptake after pruning. Residual N-15 enrichment in soil was strongly related to application depth even 406 days after N-15 placement, demonstrating the validity of this approach to mapping root activity distributions.

AB The controversial relationship between productivity and species richness in vegetation is re-examined here in the context of several other important habitat attributes. A simple conceptual model for classifying these attributes and their relationships is developed based on established principles of ecology, evolution and agriculture. Two main predictions derived from this model have important theoretical implications: First, the magnitude of loss in productivity that may result when species are lost from a natural habitat because of extinction, is likely to depend almost entirely upon which species are lost, and should depend only marginally, if at all, upon how many species are lost. Hence, any small role that species richness per se might have in affecting habitat productivity will be detectable only if species composition is controlled explicitly, which has not been the case in several recent empirical studies. Second, the most important determinants predicted for variation in species richness between habitats involve several habitat attributes, but not productivity. The commonly reported decline in species richness across habitats of increasing fertility is not explained in this model by increasing competition intensity as predicted by the popular "hump-backed" model. Frequent and intense competitive exclusion of species from highly fertile (and hence, productive) habitats certainly occurs; however, this accounts only for why many non-resident species are not adapted to this habitat type. It does not account for why the species that are adapted to this habitat type, i.e. the resident, successfully recruiting species, are relatively few in number. The present model, however, accounts for this scarcity of resident species in highly fertile habitats based on three possible hypotheses involving three principal habitat attributes: (i) a scarcity of available resource niches, reflecting relatively low environmental heterogeneity; (ii) a scarcity of opportunities for facilitation between species; and/or (iii) a scarcity of available species, reflecting scarce historical opportunities for origination of adapted species in this habitat type.

AB 1. In long-term laboratory studies, the influence of different food materials on parameters of population dynamics was compared in the sympatric woodlice, Porcellio scaber and Oniscus asellus, as a measure of interspecific differences in the utilization of food.
   2. Freshly fallen leaf litter of different tree species had been acidified and microbially inoculated prior to the experiments. By analysing the influence of pH level, density and activity of litter-colonizing microbiota and several physico-chemical characteristics of the leaf litter, we obtained information on those factors that determine food quality.
   3. The studied species responded similarly to different leaf litter species in that both P. scaber and O. asellus performed better on litter with low C:N ratio. Overall, both isopod species reproduced more successfully on litter with higher pH levels, containing half the levels of tannins and other phenolics.
   4. Interspecific differences were obvious with respect to the significance of litter-colonizing microbiota, and the dependence of juveniles on particular food parameters. While the performance of adult P. scaber was influenced by both litter-colonizing microbiota and physico-chemical characteristics of the leaf litter, adult O. asellus were influenced by leaf litter characteristics, but not by litter-colonizing microbiota. Juvenile mortality was affected by the tested food parameters in O. asellus, but not in P. scaber. Growth rates of juveniles of both species were influenced by physico-chemical characteristics of the leaf litter. Additionally, leaf litter microbiota had a significant influence on growth rates in juvenile P. scaber, but not in juvenile O. asellus.
   5. Reasons for, and consequences of, similarities and differences between the observed sympatric species, and intraspecific differences between ontogenetic stages, are important aspects of soil ecology and may help explain the sympatric coexistence of two species belonging to the same guild of saprophagous soil animals.

AB We compared the CO2- and light-dependence of photosynthesis of four tree species (Acer rubrum, Carya glabra, Cercis canadensis, Liquidambar styraciflua) growing in the understory of a loblolly pine plantation under ambient or ambient plus 200 mu l l(-1) CO2. Naturally-established saplings were fumigated with a free-air CO2 enrichment system. Light-saturated photosynthetic rates were 159-190% greater for Ce. canadensis saplings grown and measured under elevated CO2. This species had the greatest CO2 stimulation of photosynthesis. Photosynthetic rates were only 59% greater for A. rubrum saplings under CO2 enrichment and Ca. glabra and L. styraciflua had intermediate responses. Elevated CO2 stimulated light-saturated photosynthesis more than the apparent quantum yield. The maximum rate of carboxylation of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase, estimated from gas-exchange measurements, was not consistently affected by growth in elevated CO2. However, the maximum electron transport rate estimated from gas-exchange measurements and from chlorophyll fluorescence, when averaged across species and dates, was approximately 10% higher for saplings in elevated CO2. The proportionately greater stimulation of light-saturated photosynthesis than the apparent quantum yield and elevated rates of maximum electron transport suggests that saplings growing under elevated CO2 make more efficient use of sunflecks. The stimulation of light-saturated photosynthesis by CO2 did not appear to correlate with shade-tolerance ranking of the individual species. However, the species with the greatest enhancement of photosynthesis, Ce. canadensis and L. styraciflua, also invested the greatest proportion of soluble protein in Rubisco. Environmental and endogenous factors affecting N partitioning may partially explain interspecific variation in the photosynthetic response to elevated CO2.

AB Recent efforts to reconstruct the phylogenetic position of the insect order Strepsiptera have elicited a major controversy in molecular phylogenetics, We sequenced the 5.8S rDNA and major parts of the 28S rDNA 5' region of the strepsipteran species Stylops melittae. Their evolutionary dynamics were analyzed together with previously published insect rDNA sequences to identify tree estimation bias risks and to explore additional sources of phylogenetic information. Several major secondary structure changes were found as being autapomorphic for the Diptera, the Strepsiptera, or the Archaeognatha. Besides elevated substitution rates a significant AT bias was present in dipteran and strepsipteran 28S rDNA which, however, was restricted to stem sites in the Diptera while also affecting single-stranded sites in the Strepsiptera. When dipteran taxa were excluded from tree estimation all methods consistently supported the placement of Strepsiptera to within the Holometabola. When dipteran taxa were included maximum likelihood continued to favor a sister-group relationship of Strepsiptera with Mecoptera while remaining methods strongly supported a sister-group relationship with Diptera, Parametric bootstrap analysis revealed maximum likelihood as a:consistent estimator if rate heterogeneity across sites was taken into account. Though the position of Strepsiptera within Holometabola remains elusive, we conclude that the evolution of dipteran and strepsipteran rDNA involved similar yet independent changes of substitution parameters.

AB A. simple system for free air carbon dioxide enrichment (FACE) was recently developed and it is here briefly described. Such a MiniFACE system allowed the elevation of CO2 concentration of small field plots avoiding the occurrence of large spatial and temporal fluctuations. A CO2 enrichment field experiment was conducted in Italy in the season 1993-1994 with wheat (cv. Super-dwarf Mercia). A randomized experimental design was used with the treatment combination CO2 x soil N, replicated twice. Gas exchange measurements showed that photosynthetic capacity was significantly decreased in plants exposed to elevated CO2 and grown under nitrogen deficiency. Photosynthetic acclimation was, in this case, due to the occurrence of reduced rates of rubP saturated and rubP regeneration limited photosynthesis. Gas exchange measurements did not instead reveal any significant effect of elevated CO2 on the photosynthetic capacity of leaves of plants well fertilized with nitrogen, in spite of a transitory negative effect on rubP regeneration limited photosynthesis that was detected to occur in the central part of a day with high irradiance. It is concluded that the levels of nitrogen fertilization will play a substantial role in modulating CO2 fertilization effects on growth and yields of wheat crops under the scenario of future climate change.

AB Effect of tillage treatments on the cereal root diseases, rhizoctonia root rot, take-all and cereal cyst nematode, and on grain yield of cereals were tested in 4 field experiments over 3 years. Conventionally cultivated treatments were compared with a range of direct-drill treatments using either a standard tined seed drill equipped with 10 cm sowing points, a specialised drill designed to give minimal soil disturbance or a standard tined seed drill equipped with a range of commercial or modified narrow points designed to provide soil disturbance from 0 to 5.0 cm below seed depth. Direct-drilled treatments that disturbed the soil below seed depth (DDD) and treatments that included 1 cultivation prior to sowing (CPS) resulted in a reduction of rhizoctonia root rot when compared with direct-drilled treatments that did not disturb the soil below seed depth (DDN). When seasonal conditions encouraged volunteer plant growth before sowing, a chemical fallow treatment applied 3 weeks before sowing significantly reduced rhizoctonia root rot in all direct-drilled plots. This was a significant factor in DDD treatments providing effective control of rhizoctonia root rot.
   Take-all was present in 3 of the 4 experiments. In 2 experiments, take-all was significantly higher in plots following DDN treatments than DDD or CPS treatments and in 1 experiment there was no effect of tillage. Cereal cyst nematode was present in 1 of the 4 experiments. The level of root damage from cereal cyst nematode was least in plots following DDN treatments, higher following DDD treatments and highest following CPS treatments. The influence of tillage practice on grain yield was closely related to the effect of tillage on cereal root disease when levels of disease were moderate to high. Where the incidence of root disease was low, grain yield differences due to tillage treatments were generally related to agronomic factors such as seed depth and seedbed condition.

AB Population dynamics and chlamydospore germination of Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. niveum, as well as colonization of watermelon roots by F. oxysporum, were monitored in relation to other microorganism populations and the incidence of Fusarium wilt in four soils representing different suppressive and conducive conditions. The soils consisted of an induced suppressive soil developed through monoculture to watermelon c cultivar Crimson Sweet, a nonsuppressive monoculture soil, a conducive fallow soil, and the suppressive soil rendered conducive by microwave treatment. An orange-colored mutant isolate of the pathogen, comparable to the wild-type in growth, pathogenicity, and root colonization, was used to differentiate the pathogen from indigenous populations of F. oxysporum in the field soils. Pathogen populations remained stable in the monoculture soils over a 6-mo period, but increased somewhat initially and remained at higher levels when added to conducive soils. Suppressiveness was not associated with inhibition of pathogen chlamydospore germination. There were no differences among the field soils in pathogen chlamydospore germination with glucose amendments of 0-1.0 mg/g of soil. Populations of general bacteria, actinomycetes, and fluorescent pseudomonads, both in soil and on watermelon roots, tended to be greater in suppressive than in conducive field soils, whereas fungal populations were greatest in conductive field soil. Root colonization by introduced F. a. niveum, indigenous F. oxysporum, or other microorganism groups was not consistently related to suppressiveness, suggesting that specific antagonistic strains rather than general populations of microorganisms may be involved in suppression.

AB Twelve common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) cultivars were grown under greenhouse conditions to study the response of net photosynthesis (A) and transpiration (E) to variation in the leaf-to-air humidity gradient (nu). Large differences were observed between cultivars in maximum rates of A and E. The variation in A correlated with both leaf nitrogen content and specific leaf area. Thin leaves had higher nitrogen contents per unit dry weight, but thick leaves had higher nitrogen content per unit surface area. Photosynthetic nitrogen-use efficiency did not correlate with nitrogen content on either a mass or a surface area basis. Very little variation was found between cultivars in the sensitivity of total leaf conductance (g) to increasing nu, when sensitivity was defined as the slope of ln(g) versus nu (partial derivative ln(g)/partial derivative nu). No significant correlation existed between partial derivative ln(g)/partial derivative nu and variation in maximum conductance values. Much steeper slopes (greater sensitivity) were found in the response of stomatal conductance alone (g(s)) to the leaf-leaf surface humidity gradient (nu(s)). The sensitivity of stomatal response correlated positively with variation in maximum conductance among cultivars, and, since stomatal conductance was in series with a fixed boundary layer conductance, this positive correlation made possible the uniform sensitivity of g((total)) with respect to nu((leaf-air)) despite the wide variation in g(max). All cultivars reached their maximum E at very similar v values, and all showed a relatively constant E over a wide range of high nu. The implications of this relative homeostasis in E are discussed in the context of possible hydraulic limitations on E. Considerable recent interest has focussed on the use of carbon isotope discrimination (Delta) as a useful screening character in crop breeding programmes, and Delta has been found to correlate positively with yield in P. vulgaris. We found that Delta, measured on bulk leaf tissue, positively correlated with both A(max) and g(max) between bean cultivars, but did not correlate with instantaneous measures of intercellular CO2 (c(i)) when nu was held constant across all measurements. This apparent discrepancy may be due, at least in part, to variation in leaf temperatures among cultivars under normal growing conditions. Leaf-energy-budget simulations indicated that the observed range of maximum leaf conductance at low nu would generate up to 3.0 degrees C variation in leaf temperatures under field conditions of low to moderate windspeed. Given the strong stomatal response to nu, this variation in leaf temperature could cause variation in carbon isotope discrimination, which reflects long-term c(i) values. Such a mechanism of producing variation in c(i) would not be apparent in c(i) measurements taken under cuvette conditions where leaf temperature was held constant.

AB The morphology of the colonization of maize (Zea mays L.) by the vesicular arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus Glomus versiforme (Daniels and Trappe) Berch was determined quantitatively to establish the stage at which colonization was limited in response to increased P nutrition. Harvests were taken 14, 19, 24 and 29 d after planting maize in a calcined clay medium to which nutrient solution containing 0.16, 0.8 or 2.4 mM P was added daily. The fraction of the root length containing arbuscules (FAC) 19 d after planting was 0.4 with 0.16 mM P, 0.3, with 0.8 mM P and 0.17 with 2.4 mM P. Corresponding shoot P concentrations were 1.5, 2.0 and 3.2 mg g-1. Increased shoot P concentration reduced the number of appressoria per unit root length, but this accounted for only a part of the reduction in FAC. Increased root length did not account for the effect of shoot P concentration on FAC. The length of arbuscular colonized root length (total root length x FAC) per appressorium was strongly reduced in response to increased shoot P concentration. It was concluded that the reduction in FAC was mediated primarily through an inhibition of intra-radical development.

AB Sustainable strategies for managing weeds are critical to meeting agriculture's potential to feed the world's population while conserving the ecosystems and biodiversity on which we depend. The dominant paradigm of weed management in developed countries is currently founded on the two principal tools of herbicides and tillage to remove weeds. However, evidence of negative environmental impacts from both tools is growing, and herbicide resistance is increasingly prevalent. These challenges emerge from a lack of attention to how weeds interact with and are regulated by the agroecosystem as a whole. Novel technological tools proposed for weed control, such as new herbicides, gene editing, and seed destructors, do not address these systemic challenges and thus are unlikely to provide truly sustainable solutions. Combining multiple tools and techniques in an Integrated Weed Management strategy is a step forward, but many integrated strategies still remain overly reliant on too few tools. In contrast, advances in weed ecology are revealing a wealth of options to manage weedsat the agroecosystem levelthat, rather than aiming to eradicate weeds, act to regulate populations to limit their negative impacts while conserving diversity. Here, we review the current state of knowledge in weed ecology and identify how this can be translated into practical weed management. The major points are the following: (1) the diversity and type of crops, management actions and limiting resources can be manipulated to limit weed competitiveness while promoting weed diversity; (2) in contrast to technological tools, ecological approaches to weed management tend to be synergistic with other agroecosystem functions; and (3) there are many existing practices compatible with this approach that could be integrated into current systems, alongside new options to explore. Overall, this review demonstrates that integrating systems-level ecological thinking into agronomic decision-making offers the best route to achieving sustainable weed management.

AB 1. Plant traits can provide unique insights into plant performance at the community scale. Functional composition, defined by both functional diversity and community-weighted trait means (CWMs), can affect the stability of above-ground net primary production (ANPP) in response to climate extremes. Further complexity arises, however, when functional composition itself responds to environmental change. The duration of climate extremes, such as drought, is expected to increase with rising global temperatures; thus, understanding the impacts of long-term drought on functional composition and the corresponding effect that has on ecosystem function could improve predictions of ecosystem sensitivity to climate change.
   2. We experimentally reduced growing season precipitation by 66% across six temperate grasslands for 4 years and measured changes in three indices of functional diversity (functional dispersion, richness and evenness), community-weighted trait means and phylogenetic diversity (PD). Specific leaf area (SLA), leaf nitrogen content (LNC) and (at most sites) leaf turgor loss point (pi(TLP)) were measured for species cumulatively representing similar to 90% plant cover at each site.
   3. Long-term drought led to increased community functional dispersion in three sites, with negligible effects on the remaining sites. Species re-ordering following the mortality/senescence of dominant species was the main driver of increased functional dispersion. The response of functional diversity was not consistently matched by changes in phylogenetic diversity. Community-level drought strategies (assessed as CWMs) largely shifted from drought tolerance to drought avoidance and/or escape strategies, as evidenced by higher community-weighted pi(TLP), SLA and LNC. Lastly, ecosystem drought sensitivity (i.e. relative reduction in ANPP in drought plots) was positively correlated with community-weighted SLA and negatively correlated with functional diversity.
   4. Synthesis. Increased functional diversity following long-term drought may stabilize ecosystem functioning in response to future drought. However, shifts in community-scale drought strategies may increase ecosystem drought sensitivity, depending on the nature and timing of drought. Thus, our results highlight the importance of considering both functional diversity and abundance-weighted traits means of plant communities as their collective effect may either stabilize or enhance ecosystem sensitivity to drought.

AB Migration strategies in fishes comprise a rich, ecologically important, and socioeconomically valuable example of biological diversity. The variation and flexibility in migration is evident between and within individuals, populations, and species, and thereby provides a useful model system that continues to inform how ecological and evolutionary processes mold biodiversity and how biological systems respond to environmental heterogeneity and change. Migrating fishes are targeted by commercial and recreational fishing and impact the functioning of aquatic ecosystems. Sadly, many species of migrating fish are under increasing threat by exploitation, pollution, habitat destruction, dispersal barriers, overfishing, and ongoing climate change that brings modified, novel, more variable and extreme conditions and selection regimes. All this calls for protection, sustainable utilization and adaptive management. However, the situation for migrating fishes is complicated further by actions aimed at mitigating the devastating effects of such threats. Changes in river connectivity associated with removal of dispersal barriers such as dams and construction of fishways, together with compensatory breeding, and supplemental stocking can impact on gene flow and selection. How this in turn affects the dynamics, genetic structure, genetic diversity, evolutionary potential, and viability of spawning migrating fish populations remains largely unknown. In this narrative review we describe and discuss patterns, causes, and consequences of variation and flexibility in fish migration that are scientifically interesting and concern key issues within the framework of evolution and maintenance of biological diversity. We showcase how the evolutionary solutions to key questions that define migrating fish-whether or not to migrate, why to migrate, where to migrate, and when to migrate-may depend on individual characteristics and ecological conditions. We explore links between environmental change and migration strategies, and discuss whether and how threats associated with overexploitation, environmental makeovers, and management actions may differently influence vulnerability of individuals, populations, and species depending on the variation and flexibility of their migration strategies. Our goal is to provide a broad overview of knowledge in this emerging area, spur future research, and development of informed management, and ultimately promote sustainable utilization and protection of migrating fish and their ecosystems.

AB Effective biomonitoring is critical for driving management outcomes that ensure long-term sustainability of the marine environment. In recent years, environmental DNA (eDNA), coupled with metabarcoding methodologies, has emerged as a promising tool for generating biotic surveys of marine ecosystems, including those under anthropogenic pressure. However, more empirical data are needed on how to best implement eDNA field sampling approaches to maximize their utility for each specific application. The effect of the substrate chosen for eDNA sampling on the diversity of marine taxa detected by DNA metabarcoding has not yet been systematically analysed, despite aquatic systems being those most commonly targeted for eDNA studies. We investigated the effect of four commonly used eDNA substrates to explore taxonomic diversity: (a) surface water, (b) marine sediment, (c) settlement plates and (d) planktonic tows. With a focus on coastal ports, 332 eDNA samples from Australia (Indian and Southern oceans) and Kazakhstan (Caspian Sea) were collected and analysed by multi-assay DNA metabarcoding. Across study locations, between 30% and 52% of eukaryotic families detected were unique to a particular substrate and <6% of families were found in all four substrates. Taxonomic composition varied significantly depending on the substrate sampled implying that the suitability (and bias) of an eDNA substrate will depend on the focal taxa. These findings demonstrate that single substrate eDNA metabarcoding likely underestimates the total eukaryotic diversity. Future eDNA experimental design should consider incorporating multiple substrates or select substrate(s) best suited to the specific detection of target taxa.

AB The study of feedbacks between plants and soils (plant-soil feedbacks; PSFs) is receiving increased attention. However, PSFs have been mostly studied in isolation of abiotic and biotic drivers that could affect their strength and direction. This is problematic because it has led to limited predictive power of PSFs in "the real world," leaving large knowledge gaps in our ability to predict how PSFs contribute to ecosystem processes and functions. Here, we present a synthetic framework to elucidate how abiotic and biotic drivers affect PSFs. We focus on two key abiotic drivers (temperature and soil moisture) and two key biotic drivers (above-ground plant consumers and below-ground top-down control of pathogens and mutualists). We focus on these factors because they are known drivers of plants and soil organisms and the ecosystem processes they control, and hence would be expected to strongly influence PSFs. Our framework describes the proposed mechanisms behind these drivers and explores their effects on PSFs. We demonstrate the impacts of these drivers using the fast- to slow-growing plant economics spectrum. We use this well-established paradigm because plants on opposite ends of this spectrum differ in their relationships with soil biota and have developed contrasting strategies to cope with abiotic and biotic environmental conditions. Finally, we present suggestions for improved experimental designs and scientific inference that will capture and elucidate the influence of above- and belowground drivers on PSFs. By establishing the role of abiotic and biotic drivers of PSFs, we will be able to make more robust predictions of how PSFs impact on ecosystem function.

AB Foliar nitrogen is a critical factor in leaf physiological processes, plant growth, and ecosystem functioning, which has been proposed as one of the essential biodiversity variables. Nitrogen has been quantified by a number of empirical approaches using hyperspectral data, but the retrieval of nitrogen through a physically based approach remains a challenge. A recent study by Wang et al. (2015a) has revealed that leaf protein can be successfully estimated from fresh leaf spectra using a revised leaf radiative transfer model PROPECT-5 which incorporated the effects of leaf protein and cellulose + lignin on leaf reflectance and transmittance. This provides a potential approach of estimating nitrogen using radiative transfer models given the correlation between protein and nitrogen. However, such a revised leaf model has not been tested for the estimation of leaf nitrogen at the canopy level. In this study, a canopy reflectance model INFORM, coupled with the revised PROSPECT-5 model, was used to retrieve leaf and canopy nitrogen content in a mixed temperate forest using the wavelengths of 800-2500 nm from airborne hyperspectral imagery. Ecological criteria were applied to the parameterization of the model to reduce unrealistic combinations of input parameters. Global sensitivity analysis showed that leaf protein played a small but distinct role in driving the variation of canopy reflectance in the INFORM model. More accurate estimation was obtained for canopy nitrogen content (R-2 = 0.64, RMSE = 1.90, NRMSE = 0.18) than leaf nitrogen content (R-2 = 0.46, RMSE = 3.79e-05, NRMSE = 0.19). Moreover, inversion techniques, particularly regularized look-up tables, further improved the estimation accuracies compared to the original tables. Our results indicate that leaf and canopy nitrogen content can be retrieved successfully at the canopy level by inversion of INFORM. Both the direct and indirect effects of nitrogen on canopy reflectance are important for nitrogen estimation. The maps of leaf and canopy nitrogen content are the first to be generated using inversion of coupled leaf-canopy models, and the spatial variation of foliar nitrogen appears to be reasonable and consistent with ecological knowledge.

AB This paper evaluates the relationship between fire occurrence (number and burned area) and climate variability (precipitation and maximum temperatures) across central and south-central Chile (32 degrees-43 degrees S) during recent decades (1976-2013). This region sustains the largest proportion of the Chilean population, contains ecologically important remnants of endemic ecosystems, the largest extension of forest exotic plantations, and concentrates most of the fire activity in the country. Fire activity in central Chile was mainly associated with above-average precipitation during winter of the previous year and with dry conditions during spring to summer. The later association was particularly strong in the southern, wetter part of the study region. Maximum temperature had a positive significant relationship with burned area across the study region, with stronger correlations toward the south. Fires in central Chile were significantly related to El Nino-Southern Oscillation, through rainfall anomalies during the year previous to the fire season. The Antarctic Oscillation during winter through summer was positively related to fires across the study area due to drier/warmer conditions associated with the positive polarity of this oscillation. Climate change projections for the region reveal an all-season decrease in precipitation and increases in temperature, that may likely result in an increment of the occurrence and the area affected by fires, as it has been observed during a multi-year drought afflicting central Chile since 2010.

AB Recent analyses of plant traits across large sets of species have revolutionized our understanding of plant functional differentiation. However, understanding of ecological relevance of this differentiation is contingent upon knowledge of environmental preferences of species, namely along gradients of disturbance and productivity for which no quantitative data were available until recently. We examined the relationships of key functional traits (life-history categories, leaf-height-seed (LHS) traits, clonal growth and bud bank traits) in the herb-dominated flora of Central Europe to species niche positions along the gradients of disturbance frequency, disturbance severity and productivity. Life-history categories and bud bank size showed the strongest response to disturbance and productivity, whereas relationship of LHS traits was much weaker. A number of traits, including clonal growth form and bud bank size, showed a significantly unimodal response to disturbance frequency. Responses of many traits to disturbance frequency were different from their responses to disturbance severity. Our findings support the notions that disturbance and productivity are key gradients of species functional differentiation and that disturbance severity and frequency select for different trait suites. Furthermore, the data indicate that in a predominantly herbaceous flora, the traits of life span, clonal growth and resprouting show stronger relationship with the environment than the LHS traits, which are more important in floras with high proportions of woody species. Since most previous trait analyses are based on woody-plant-dominated floras, patterns revealed in a herb-dominated flora deepen our understanding of the full range of variation within the plant kingdom.

AB Surface waters off eastern Tasmania are a global warming hotspot. Here, mean temperatures have been rising over several decades at nearly four times the global average rate, with concomitant changes in extreme temperatures - marine heatwaves. These changes have recently caused the marine biodiversity, fisheries and aquaculture industries off Tasmania's east coast to come under stress. In this study we quantify the long-term trends, variability and predictability of marine heatwaves off eastern Tasmania. We use a high-resolution ocean model for Tasmania's eastern continental shelf. The ocean state over the 1993-2015 period is hindcast, providing daily estimates of the three-dimensional temperature and circulation fields. Marine heatwaves are identified at the surface and subsurface from ocean temperature time series using a consistent definition. Trends in marine heatwave frequency are positive nearly everywhere and annual marine heatwave days and penetration depths indicate significant positive changes, particularly off southeastern Tasmania. A decomposition into modes of variability indicates that the East Australian Current is the dominant driver of marine heatwaves across the domain. Self-organising maps are used to identify 12 marine heatwave types, each with its own regionality, seasonality, and associated large-scale oceanic and atmospheric circulation patterns. The implications of this work for marine ecosystems and their management were revealed through review of past impacts and stake-holder discussions regarding use of these data.

AB Urban trees have been increasingly appreciated for the many benefits they provide. As concentrated hubs of human-mediated movement, the urban landscape is, however, often the first point of contact for exotic pests including insects and plant pathogens. Consequently, urban trees can be important for accidentally introduced forest pests to become established and potentially invasive. Reductions in biodiversity and the potential for stressful conditions arising from anthropogenic disturbances can predispose these trees to pest attack, further increasing the likelihood of exotic forest pests becoming established and increasing in density. Once established in urban environments, dispersal of introduced pests can proceed to natural forest landscapes or planted forests. In addition to permanent long-term damage to natural ecosystems, the consequences of these invasions include costly attempts at eradication and post establishment management strategies. We discuss a range of ecological, economic and social impacts arising from these incursions and the importance of global biosecurity is highlighted as a crucially important barrier to pest invasions. Finally, we suggest that urban trees may be viewed as 'sentinel plantings'. In particular, botanical gardens and arboreta frequently house large collections of exotic plantings, providing a unique opportunity to help predict and prevent the invasion of new pests, and where introduced pests with the capacity to cause serious impacts in forest environments could potentially be detected during the initial stages of establishment. Such early detection offers the only realistic prospect of eradication, thereby reducing damaging ecological impacts and long term management costs.

AB Comprehensive knowledge of the effects of disturbances on biodiversity is crucial for conservation and management, not least because ecosystems with low biodiversity may be the most vulnerable. In rivers, the role of disturbance in shaping aquatic biodiversity has mainly focused on floods. Perennial rivers (PRs) often flood, whereas intermittent rivers (IRs) flood, stop flowing and dry. Despite the recent and significant increase in research on IRs, controversy remains about whether they are more or less biodiverse than PRs. Our aim was to determine (Q1) if PRs and IRs differ in biodiversity and (Q2) if the direction and magnitude of the differences (effect sizes) are related to environmental (climate, season, habitat, longitudinal zonation and anthropogenic disturbance) and/or biological factors (taxonomic group). We conducted a meta-analysis on 44 published studies of PR and IR biodiversity that had replicated data. We applied random effects models to the data to obtain weighted mean effect sizes for differences between PRs and IRs, and their confidence intervals, by first considering all studies and then by splitting studies into groups on the basis of the above factors. We found that biodiversity was significantly higher in PRs than in IRs (Q1). We also detected significant differences (PRs > IRs) in studies of macroinvertebrates, in those conducted within arid and temperate climates, dry and wet sampling seasons, headwaters, and regions subject to different levels of anthropogenic disturbance (Q2). Our meta-analysis suggests that the expected increase in the prevalence of IRs in certain regions of the world due to global change could result in a decrease in freshwater biodiversity. To better manage and preserve aquatic biodiversity under future global change scenarios and to avoid potential ecosystem consequences of biodiversity loss, conservation efforts should be targeted towards those environmental conditions or taxonomic groups with significant differences (PRs > IRs).

AB Global climate change is already having an impact on species ranges. For species with slow demography and limited dispersal, such as trees, lags between climate change and distribution shifts are likely to increase in the future. Such lags can be of critical importance to management and biodiversity of forests, because they can result in 'extinction debts', where populations temporarily persist under unsuitable conditions, and 'colonization credits', where suitable locations are not occupied owing to slow demography and limited dispersal. Here we use a range dynamics model based on metapopulation theory to show that the distributions of 21 dominant trees in eastern North America are out of equilibrium with climate and demonstrate both extinction debt and colonization credit. Moreover, lags are more severe at northern range limits, suggesting that range contraction in response to warming temperatures will outpace expansion.

AB Plant traits can be used to understand a range of ecological processes, including competition with invasive species. The extent to which native and invasive species are competing via limiting similarity or trait hierarchies has important implications for the management of invaded communities. We screened 47 native species that co-occur with Festuca perennis, a dominant invader in California serpentine grassland, for traits pertaining to resource use and acquisition. We then grew F. perennis with 10 species spanning a range of functional similarity in pairwise competition trials. Functionally similar species did not have a strong adverse effect on F. perennis performance as would be expected by limiting similarity theory. Phylogenetic relatedness, which may integrate a number of functional traits, was also a poor predictor of competitive outcome. Instead, species with high specific root length, low root-to-shoot biomass ratio, and low leaf nitrogen concentration were more effective at suppressing the growth of F. perennis. Our results suggest that fitness differences (i.e., trait hierarchies) may be more important than niche differences (i.e., limiting similarity) in structuring competitive outcomes in this system and may be a promising approach for the restoration of invaded systems.

AB In many ecosystems, nitrogen is the most limiting nutrient for plant growth and productivity. However, current Earth System Models (ESMs) do not mechanistically represent functional nitrogen allocation for photosynthesis or the linkage between nitrogen uptake and root traits. The current version of CLM (4.5) links nitrogen availability and plant productivity via (1) an instantaneous downregulation of potential photosynthesis rates based on soil mineral nitrogen availability, and (2) apportionment of soil nitrogen between plants and competing nitrogen consumers assumed to be proportional to their relative N demands. However, plants do not photosynthesize at potential rates and then downregulate; instead photosynthesis rates are governed by nitrogen that has been allocated to the physiological processes underpinning photosynthesis. Furthermore, the role of plant roots in nutrient acquisition has also been largely ignored in ESMs. We therefore present a new plant nitrogen model for CLM4.5 with (1) improved representations of linkages between leaf nitrogen and plant productivity based on observed relationships in a global plant trait database and (2) plant nitrogen uptake based on root-scale Michaelis-Menten uptake kinetics. Our model improvements led to a global bias reduction in GPP, LAI, and biomass of 70%, 11%, and 49%, respectively. Furthermore, water use efficiency predictions were improved conceptually, qualitatively, and in magnitude. The new model's GPP responses to nitrogen deposition, CO2 fertilization, and climate also differed from the baseline model. The mechanistic representation of leaf-level nitrogen allocation and a theoretically consistent treatment of competition with belowground consumers led to overall improvements in global carbon cycling predictions.

AB Within-canopy variation in leaf structural and photosynthetic characteristics is a major means by which whole canopy photosynthesis is maximized at given total canopy nitrogen. As key acclimatory modifications, leaf nitrogen content (N (A)) and photosynthetic capacity (A (A)) per unit area increase with increasing light availability in the canopy and these increases are associated with increases in leaf dry mass per unit area (M (A)) and/or nitrogen content per dry mass and/or allocation. However, leaf functional characteristics change with increasing leaf age during leaf development and aging, but the importance of these alterations for within-canopy trait gradients is unknown. I conducted a meta-analysis based on 71 canopies that were sampled at different time periods or, in evergreens, included measurements for different-aged leaves to understand how within-canopy variations in leaf traits (trait plasticity) depend on leaf age. The analysis demonstrated that in evergreen woody species, M (A) and N (A) plasticity decreased with increasing leaf age, but the change in A (A) plasticity was less suggesting a certain re-acclimation of A (A) to altered light. In deciduous woody species, M (A) and N (A) gradients in flush-type species increased during leaf development and were almost invariable through the rest of the season, while in continuously leaf-forming species, the trait gradients increased constantly with increasing leaf age. In forbs, N (A) plasticity increased, while in grasses, N (A) plasticity decreased with increasing leaf age, reflecting life form differences in age-dependent changes in light availability and in nitrogen resorption for growth of generative organs. Although more work is needed to improve the coverage of age-dependent plasticity changes in some plant life forms, I argue that the age-dependent variation in trait plasticity uncovered in this study is large enough to warrant incorporation in simulations of canopy photosynthesis through the growing period.

AB AimEmerging polyploids may depend on environmental niche shifts for successful establishment. Using the alpine plant Ranunculus kuepferi as a model system, we explore the niche shift hypothesis at different spatial resolutions and in contrasting parts of the species range.
   LocationEuropean Alps.
   MethodsWe sampled 12 individuals from each of 102 populations of R. kuepferi across the Alps, determined their ploidy levels, derived coarse-grain (100x100m) environmental descriptors for all sampling sites by downscaling WorldClim maps, and calculated fine-scale environmental descriptors (2x2m) from indicator values of the vegetation accompanying the sampled individuals. Both coarse and fine-scale variables were further computed for 8239 vegetation plots from across the Alps. Subsequently, we compared niche optima and breadths of diploid and tetraploid cytotypes by combining principal components analysis and kernel smoothing procedures. Comparisons were done separately for coarse and fine-grain data sets and for sympatric, allopatric and the total set of populations.
   ResultsAll comparisons indicate that the niches of the two cytotypes differ in optima and/or breadths, but results vary in important details. The whole-range analysis suggests differentiation along the temperature gradient to be most important. However, sympatric comparisons indicate that this climatic shift was not a direct response to competition with diploid ancestors. Moreover, fine-grained analyses demonstrate niche contraction of tetraploids, especially in the sympatric range, that goes undetected with coarse-grained data.
   Main conclusionsAlthough the niche optima of the two cytotypes differ, separation along ecological gradients was probably less decisive for polyploid establishment than a shift towards facultative apomixis, a particularly effective strategy to avoid minority cytotype exclusion. In addition, our results suggest that coarse-grained analyses overestimate niche breadths of widely distributed taxa. Niche comparison analyses should hence be conducted at environmental data resolutions appropriate for the organism and question under study.

AB In naturally disturbed systems, harsh environmental conditions act as filters on the regional species pool, restricting the number of taxa able to form a local community to those with traits promoting resistance or resilience. Thus, communities in highly disturbed ecosystems may be less sensitive to a given disturbance than those in less disturbed ecosystems. We explored this idea by examining the response of aquatic invertebrate communities to flow intermittence in gravel-bed, braided rivers (BRs). Flow intermittence is considered a major driver of communities in rivers, but its influence on communities in BRs, which are recognized as naturally highly disturbed environments, is relatively unexplored. We used a multisite Before-After-Control-Impact (BACI) design to quantify the effects of drying events of different durations (moderate: 2-3 wk, severe: 1-3 mo) on invertebrate communities in 8 BRs in southeastern France. As predicted, no effects of flow intermittence were detected 1 to 4 mo after flow resumption on taxonomic richness, composition, or functional diversity of communities facing moderate drying events. Communities subjected to severe drying events were similar to those in perennial reaches as few as 19 d after flow resumption. Moreover, communities showed functional redundancy and no loss of functional diversity after drying events. These results differ from those of studies in other river systems, where persistent effects of flow intermittence on communities generally have been found, and highlight the need for cross-system comparisons that explore the effects of drying on communities. Identifying the processes (e.g., niche selection, cotolerance) and habitat features (e.g., hyporheic zone refugia) that promote community resilience in BRs will advance our understanding of how anthropogenic stressors and climate change may affect communities in freshwater ecosystems.

AB Ecosystem services provide multiple benefits to human wellbeing and are increasingly considered by policy-makers in environmental management. However, the uncertainty related with the monetary valuation of these benefits is not yet adequately defined or integrated by policy-makers. Given this background, our aim was to quantify different sources of uncertainty when performing monetary valuation of ecosystem services, in order to provide a series of guidelines to reduce them. With an example of 4 ecosystem services (i.e., water provisioning, waste treatment, erosion protection, and habitat for species) provided at the river basin scale, we quantified the uncertainty associated with the following sources: (1) the number of services considered, (2) the number of benefits considered for each service, (3) the valuation metrics (i.e. valuation methods) used to value benefits, and (4) the uncertainty of the parameters included in the valuation metrics. Results indicate that the highest uncertainty was caused by the number of services considered, as well as by the number of benefits considered for each service, whereas the parametric uncertainty was similar to the one related to the selection of valuation metric, thus suggesting that the parametric uncertainty, which is the only uncertainty type commonly considered, was less critical than the structural uncertainty, which is in turn mainly dependent on the decision-making context. Given the uncertainty associated to the valuation structure, special attention should be given to the selection of services, benefits and metrics according to a given context. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB Transformations are underway in our ability to collect and interrogate remotely sensed data. Here we explore the utility of three machine-learning methods for identifying the controls on coastal cliff land sliding using a dataset from Auckland, New Zealand. Models were built using all available data with a resampling approach used to evaluate uncertainties. All methods identify two dominant landslide predictors (unfailed cliff slope angle and fault proximity). This information could support a range of management approaches, from the development of 'rules-of-thumb' to detailed models that incorporate all predictor information. In our study all statistical approaches correctly predict a high proportion (>85%) of cases. Similar 'success' has been shown in other studies, but important questions should be asked about possible error sources, particularly in regard to absence data. In coastal landslide studies sign decay is a vexing issue, because sites prone to landsliding may also be sites of rapid evidence removal. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The concentration of nitrogen (N) in foliage often limits photosynthesis and can influence a number of important biogeochemical processes. For this reason, methods for estimating foliar %N over a range of scales are needed to enhance understanding of terrestrial carbon and nitrogen cycles. High spectral resolution aircraft remote sensing has become an increasingly common tool for landscape-scale estimates of canopy %N because reflectance in some portions of the spectrum has been shown to correlate strongly with field-measured %N. These patterns have been observed repeatedly over a wide range of biomes, opening new possibilities for planned Earth observation satellites. Nevertheless, the effects of spectral resolution and other sensor characteristics on %N estimates have not been fully examined, and may have implications for future analyses at landscape, regional and global scales. In this study, we explored the effects of spectral resolution, spatial resolution and sensor fidelity on relationships between forest canopy %N and reflectance measurements from airborne and satellite platforms. We conducted an exercise whereby PLS, simple and multiple regression calibrations to field-measured canopy %N for a series of forested sites were iteratively performed using (1) high resolution data from AVIRIS (Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer) that were degraded spectrally from 10 nm to 30 nm, 50 nm, 70 nm, and 90 nm bandwidths, and spatially from 18 m to 30 m and 60 m pixels; (2) data representing Landsat and MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) spectral bands simulated with data from AVIRIS; and (3) actual data from Landsat and MODIS. We observed virtually no reduction in the strength of relationships between %N and reflectance when using coarser bandwidths from AVIRIS, but instead saw declines with increasing spatial resolution and loss of sensor fidelity. This suggests that past efforts to examine foliar %N using broad-band sensors may have been limited as much by the latter two properties as by their coarser spectral bandwidths. We also found that regression models were driven primarily by reflectance over broad portions of the near infrared (NIR) region, with little contribution from the visible or mid infrared regions. These results suggest that much of the variability in canopy %N is related to broad reflectance properties in the NIR region, indicating promise for broad scale canopy N estimation from a variety of sensors.

AB Many landscape genetic studies promise results that can be applied in conservation management. However, only few landscape genetic studies have been used by practitioners. Here, we identified scientific topics in landscape genetics that need to be addressed before results can more successfully be applied in conservation management. For each topic, weaknesses of common practice in landscape genetic analysis are described by presenting examples from current studies and further recommendations for improvements are outlined. First, we suggest matching the extent of the study area with those of conservation management units and the study species' dispersal potential when designing landscape genetic studies. Second, the quality of the underlying statistical models should be optimised, and models should include variables that are useful for management implementation. Third, to further improve the applicability of landscape genetic studies, thresholds for landscape effects on gene flow should be identified. Fourth, landscape genetic models could be used for the development of conservation planning tools, which ideally also incorporate the above described thresholds. Fifth and as discussed in earlier studies, the use of multiple species and replication at the landscape scale is recommended. Although it appears that only few landscape genetic studies have been applied in practical management until now, examples presented in this article show that landscape genetic methods can provide important information to formulate concrete management implications. Thus, addressing the above-mentioned scientific topics in landscape genetic studies would enhance the benefits of their results for practitioners.

AB Root length density (RLD) was measured to 1 m depth for 17 commercial crops of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum) and 40 crops of winter oilseed rape [Brassica napus; oilseed rape (OSR)] grown in the UK between 2004 and 2013. Taking the critical RLD (cRLD) for water capture as 1 cm cm(-3), RLDs appeared inadequate for full water capture on average below a depth of 0.32 m for winter wheat and below 0.45 m for OSR. These depths compare unfavourably (for wheat) with average depths of 'full capture' of 0.86 m and 0.48 m, respectively, determined for three wheat crops and one OSR crop studied in the 1970s and 1980s, and treated as references here. A simple model of water uptake and yield indicated that these shortfalls in wheat and OSR rooting compared with the reference data might be associated with shortfalls of up to 3.5 t ha(-1) and 1.2 t ha(-1), respectively, in grain yields under water-limited conditions, as increasingly occur through climate change. Coupled with decreased summer rainfall, poor rooting of modern arable crops could explain much of the yield stagnation that has been observed on UK farms since the 1990s. Methods of monitoring and improving rooting under commercial conditions are reviewed and discussed.

AB Wildfires are a primary disturbance in the Sierras de Cordoba, Argentina, with approximately 2 152 000 ha burned between 1993 and 2012. However, little is known about the spatial and temporal patterns of fires and their relationship with climate and vegetation in this area. Such information is of great value for fire risk assessment and the development of strategies for fire management. Our main objective was to analyze fire activity in four sierran ranges, assessing which weather and climate conditions were mostly related to fire activity, and which land cover types were mostly burned. We used a fire database of mid-high spatial resolution and a land cover map derived from Landsat imagery. Fire regimes were different among the different sierran ranges. The Sierras Chicas range was the most affected by fires, with the largest number of fire events, burned area, and fire frequency. Although large fires represented 3 % to 5 % of fire events, they accounted for 60 % to 86 % of total burned area in different sierran ranges. Sierras of lower elevation had a winter seasonality of fires, while sierras of higher elevation had a winter-spring or spring fire seasonality. The number of fire events was positively correlated with preceding periods that were wetter than normal, while the burned area was mainly associated with midterm weather conditions. Fires occurred mainly in grasslands and shrublands, but the area of burned forests was important, too. Our results will be useful to determine the times and conditions in which fire risk is highest, and also to identify where preventive efforts should be focused.

AB The Green Corridor in the lower reaches of Tarim River in northwestern China has an extreme hot and dry climate. Vegetation here, consisting of arbor, shrub and grass, relies on groundwater exceedingly. However, the increasing anthropogenic activities of large-scale agricultural reclamation and unreasonable water utilization in the upper and middle reaches caused the 321-km riverway in the lower reaches to dry up completely in 1972 and resulted in the sharp decline of groundwater, followed by the ruin of desert riparian vegetation on a large scale. The Green Corridor is on the verge of shrinking. Water has a key role in maintaining ecological balance and socioeconomic development. This paper, focused on the relationship between vegetation and groundwater, discusses (1) the change of groundwater table caused by the ecological water delivery carried out in the lower reaches of Tarim River; (2) the appropriate groundwater depth meeting the vegetation's survival; (3) the minimum ecological flux and ecological water requirement for the growth of natural vegetation. It was shown that (1) based on the analysis of the monitoring data from the groundwater level of ten times water delivery, such an extensive artificial watering takes positive effect on raising the groundwater level along the two sides of the river; (2) a groundwater table depth of 2-4 m is probably the appropriate ecological water table level for the lower reaches of the Tarim River, and 6 m is the threshold for the local vegetation; (3) at the lower Tarim River, 1.157 x 10(8) m(3) of water flow is needed for itself. The longer the duration of water releases, the greater would be the groundwater rise and the larger the range of vegetation influenced. It was found that the duration and volume of water delivery was closely related to restoration of vegetation in the lower reaches of the Tarim River. The goal of this paper is to offer scientific evidences for water delivery in the rigorous areas to maintain an ecological balance.

AB Backgrounds and Aims Leaf functional traits have been used as a basis to categoize plants across a range of resource- use specialization, from those that conserve available resources to those that exploit them. However, the extent to which the leaf functional traits used to define the resource-use strategies are related to root traits and are good indicators of the ability of the roots to take up nitrogen (N) are poorly known. This is an important question because interspecific differences in N uptake have been proposed as one mechanism by which species' coexistence may be determined. This study therefore investigated the relationships between functional traits and N uptake ability for grass species across a range of conservative to exploitative resource-use strategies.
   Methods Root uptake of NH4+ and NO3, and leaf and root functional traits were measured for eight grass species sampled at three grassland sites across Europe, in France, Austria and the UK. Species were grown in hydroponics to determine functional traits and kinetic uptake parameters (I-max and K-m) under standardized conditions.
   Key Results Species with high specific leaf area (SLA) and shoot N content, and low leaf and root dry matter content (LDMC and RDMC, respectively), which are traits associated with the exploitative syndrome, had higher uptake and affinity for both N forms. No trade-off was observed in uptake between the two forms of N, and all species expressed a higher preference for NH4+.
   Conclusions The results support the use of leaf traits, and especially SLA and LDMC, as indicators of the N uptake ability across a broad range of grass species. The difficulties associated with assessing root properties are also highlighted, as root traits were only weakly correlated with leaf traits, and only RDMC and, to a lesser extent, root N content were related to leaf traits.

AB Understanding the processes regulating population temporal stability is important to infer species coexistence and ecosystem stability patterns. It has been hypothesized that population temporal stability could be driven by functional trade-offs in resource acquisition and growth rate strategies. We tested this hypothesis by analyzing a 13-year data set from a mown grassland community in a factorial experiment with fertilization and dominant removal as the main treatment effects. Population temporal stability, measured as a coefficient of variation of species' biomass over time, was related to plant traits covering different functional trade-offs. These included plant height, leaf dry matter content (LDMC), specific leaf area, seed mass, leaf delta C-13, and rooting depth. Three of the traits (LDMC, rooting depth, and leaf delta C-13) had significant relationships with population temporal stability, even after accounting for species' phylogenetic relatedness. Higher values of LDMC, the best predictor, were consistently associated with greater population temporal stability across all experimental conditions. This suggests a functional trade-off along the leaf economics spectrum, with more conservative, slow-growing species being more stable over time. Incorporating functional trade-offs into the assessment of population temporal dynamics will allow for a more comprehensive understanding of the processes that sustain the stability of ecosystems and species coexistence.

AB Fire regimes of the Canadian boreal forest are driven by certain environmental factors that are highly variable from year to year (e.g., temperature, precipitation) and others that are relatively stable (e.g., land cover, topography). Studies examining the relative influence of these environmental drivers on fire activity suggest that models making explicit use of interannual variability appear to better capture years of climate extremes, whereas those using a temporal average of all available years highlight the importance of land-cover variables. It has been suggested that fire models built at different temporal resolutions may provide a complementary understanding of controls on fire regimes, but this claim has not been tested explicitly with parallel data and modeling approaches. We addressed this issue by building two models of area burned for the period 1980-2010 using 14 explanatory variables to describe ignitions, vegetation, climate, and topography. We built one model at an annual resolution, with climate and some land-cover variables being updated annually, and the other model using 31-year fire "climatology'' based on averaged variables. Despite substantial differences in the variables' contributions to the two models, their predictions were broadly similar, which suggests coherence between the spatial patterns of annually varying climate extremes and long-term climate normals. Where the models' predictions diverged, discrepancies between the annual and averaged models could be attributed to specific explanatory variables. For instance, annually updating land cover allowed us to identify a possible negative feedback between flammable biomass and fire activity. These results show that building models at more than one temporal resolution affords a deeper understanding of controls on fire activity in boreal Canada than can be achieved by examining a single model. However, in terms of spatial predictions, the additional effort required to build annual models of fire activity may not always be warranted in this study area. From a management and policy standpoint, this key finding should boost confidence in models that incorporate climatic normals, thereby providing a stronger foundation on which to make decisions on adaptation and mitigation strategies for future fire activity.

AB Loss of functional connectivity following habitat loss and fragmentation could drive species declines. A comprehensive understanding of fragmentation effects on functional connectivity of an ecological assemblage requires investigation of multiple species with different mobilities, at different spatial scales, for each sex, and in different landscapes. Based on published data on mobility and ecological responses to fragmentation of 10 woodland-dependent birds, and using simulation studies, we predicted that (1) fragmentation would impede dispersal and gene flow of eight "decliners'' (species that disappear from suitable patches when landscape-level tree cover falls below species-specific thresholds), but not of two "tolerant'' species (whose occurrence in suitable habitat patches is independent of landscape tree cover); and that fragmentation effects would be stronger (2) in the least mobile species, (3) in the more philopatric sex, and (4) in the more fragmented region. We tested these predictions by evaluating spatially explicit isolation-by-landscape-resistance models of gene flow in fragmented landscapes across a 50 3 170 km study area in central Victoria, Australia, using individual and population genetic distances. To account for sex-biased dispersal and potential scale-and configuration-specific effects, we fitted models specific to sex and geographic zones. As predicted, four of the least mobile decliners showed evidence of reduced genetic connectivity. The responses were strongly sex specific, but in opposite directions in the two most sedentary species. Both tolerant species and (unexpectedly) four of the more mobile decliners showed no reduction in gene flow. This is unlikely to be due to time lags because more mobile species develop genetic signatures of fragmentation faster than do less mobile ones. Weaker genetic effects were observed in the geographic zone with more aggregated vegetation, consistent with gene flow being unimpeded by landscape structure. Our results indicate that for all but the most sedentary species in our system, the movement of the more dispersive sex (females in most cases) maintains overall genetic connectivity across fragmented landscapes in the study area, despite some small-scale effects on the more philopatric sex for some species. Nevertheless, to improve population viability for the less mobile bird species, structural landscape connectivity must be increased.

AB One-quarter of anthropogenically produced nitrous oxide (N2O) comes from rivers and estuaries. Countries reporting N2O fluxes from aquatic surfaces under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change typically estimate anthropogenic inorganic nitrogen loading and assume a fraction becomes N2O. However, several studies have not confirmed a linear relationship between dissolved nitrate (NO3-) and river N2O fluxes. We apply recursive partitioning analysis to examine the relationships between N2O flux and NO3-, dissolved oxygen (DO), temperature, land use and surficial geology in the Grand River, Canada, a seventh-order river in an agricultural catchment with substantial urban population. Results suggest that N2O flux is high when hypoxia exists. Temperature, not NO3-, was the primary correlate of N2O flux when hypoxia does not occur suggesting NO3- is not limiting N2O production and Further increases in NO3- may not lead to comparable increases in N2O flux. This work indicates that a linear relationship between NO3- and N2O is unlikely to exist in most agricultural and urban impacted river systems. Most N2O is produced during hypoxia so quantifying the extent of hypoxia is a necessary first step to quantifying N2O fluxes in lotic systems. Predicted increases in riverine hypoxia via eutrophication and increased temperature due to climate change may drive nonlinear increases in N2O production.

AB <list list-type="1" id="mam12010-list-0001"> Basic knowledge on the biology and ecology of a species is fundamental for the realistic assessment of its conservation status and for planning effective conservation strategies. The latest assessment of the 21 extant armadillo species (Xenarthra, Dasypodidae) by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) for its Red List of Threatened Species shows that considerable gaps exist in our knowledge of these Neotropical mammals. Our goal was to analyse the existing literature on armadillos to define thematic and regional research priorities that will eventually benefit their conservation. We categorized 3117 publications on extant armadillos published between 1660 and 2011 according to their research topic, species studied, country and publication language. The number of publications per research topic and the number per species were very variable. The nine best-studied species are classed as Least Concern by the IUCN, while three of the four least-studied species are classed as Data Deficient. At least one field study was done in each range country, but over 80% of field research took place in the USA, Brazil, Argentina and Bolivia. Most research was done in the USA on leprosy in Dasypus novemcinctus. Most ecological research has been focused on four species, and data on the ecology of Data Deficient and Vulnerable taxa are virtually absent. Field research on armadillos should be intensified to broaden conservation-relevant knowledge. Additional studies in the Guianas, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Venezuela and Paraguay are urgently needed to assess the conservation status of armadillos in these regions. Future research should focus on ecology, conservation, population genetics, reproduction and threats. Species priorities should include country endemics, such as Dasypus pilosus (Peru), Tolypeutes tricinctus (Brazil) and Dasypus yepesi and Chlamyphorus truncatus (Argentina), as well as other Data Deficient and Vulnerable species, especially Cabassous centralis and Calyptophractus retusus.

AB In 2011, the European Council stressed the significance of water quality for sustainable development in Europe and emphasized the need for better integration of the water policy objectives into the Common Agriculture Policy reform in rural areas. Since 2000, the Water Framework Directive (WFD) has required the EU Member States to target good ecological status for their water bodies. However, the implementation of the Directive for the numerous Mediterranean temporary streams has been delayed indicating the need for elaboration of the tools and methods that address the special characteristics of such water bodies. This requirement has been addressed by the recently completed MIRAGE project. In the context of the recent publication of the European Commission's Blueprint to Safeguard Europe's Waters, the MIRAGE-proposed framework for the characterization of the eco-hydrological dynamics and the systematic description of the measured impact for temporary rivers could bring considerable added value to the EU revision of all relevant water policies. The project recommends additions to WFD articles including an explicit definition of temporary rivers, adaptation of environmental objectives to their peculiarities and establishment of a proper method to determine the initial status and specific actions in River Basin Management Plans.

AB Aim Although many factors undoubtedly affect species geographic distributions, can a single, simple model nonetheless capture most of the spatial variation in the probability of presence/absence in a large set of species? For 482 North American tree species that occur east of the Rocky Mountains, we investigated the shape(s) of the relationship between the probability of occupancy of a given location and macroclimate, and its consistency among species and regions. Location North America. Methods Using Little's tree range maps, we tested four hypothetical shapes of response relating occupancy to climate: (1) high occupancy of all suitable climates; (2) threshold response (i.e. unsuitable climates exclude species, but within the thresholds, species presence is independent of climate); (3) occupancy is a bivariate normal function of annual temperature and precipitation; and (4) asymmetric limitation (i.e. abiotic factors set abrupt range limits in stressful climates only). Finally, we compared observed climatic niches with the occupancy of similar climates on off-shore islands as well as west of the Rockies. Results (a) Species' distributions in climatic space do not have strong thresholds, nor are they systematically skewed towards less stressful climates. (b) Occupancy can generally be described by a bivariate normal function of temperature and precipitation, with little or no interaction between the two variables. This model, averaged over all species, accounts for 82% of the spatial variation in the probability of occupancy of a given area. (c) Occupied geographic ranges are typically ringed by unoccupied, but climatically suitable areas. (d) Observed climatic niche positions are largely conserved between regions. Main conclusions We conclude that, despite the complexities of species histories and biologies, to a first approximation most of the variation in their geographic distributions relates to climate, in similar ways for nearly all species.

AB While supportive breeding programmes strive to minimize negative genetic impacts to populations, case studies have found evidence for reduced fitness of artificially produced individuals when they reproduce in the wild. Pedigrees of two complete generations were tracked with molecular markers to investigate differences in reproductive success (RS) of wild and hatchery-reared Chinook salmon spawning in the natural environment to address questions regarding the demographic and genetic impacts of supplementation to a natural population. Results show a demographic boost to the population from supplementation. On average, fish taken into the hatchery produced 4.7 times more adult offspring, and 1.3 times more adult grand-offspring than naturally reproducing fish. Of the wild and hatchery fish that successfully reproduced, we found no significant differences in RS between any comparisons, but hatchery-reared males typically had lower RS values than wild males. Mean relative reproductive success (RRS) for hatchery F1 females and males was 1.11 (P=0.84) and 0.89 (P=0.56), respectively. RRS of hatchery-reared fish (H) that mated in the wild with either hatchery or wild-origin (W) fish was generally equivalent to WxW matings. Mean RRS of HxW and HxH matings was 1.07 (P=0.92) and 0.94 (P=0.95), respectively. We conclude that fish chosen for hatchery rearing did not have a detectable negative impact on the fitness of wild fish by mating with them for a single generation. Results suggest that supplementation following similar management practices (e.g. 100% local, wild-origin brood stock) can successfully boost population size with minimal impacts on the fitness of salmon in the wild.

AB For instantaneous latent heat flux (lambda(E)) estimates from thermal remote sensing data to be useful in the hydrologic sciences, they require integration over longer time frames (e.g., months to years). This is not trivial because thermal remote sensing data acquired under cloud-free daytime conditions require upscaling to a monthly energy amount that is both relevant over cloudy periods and considers daytime and nighttime. Previous work has compared upscaling approaches, but as yet there is no authoritative comparison that does so under conditions relevant for thermal remote sensing. In this paper we describe, under the conditions relevant for thermal remote sensing, a generic framework for comparing any upscaling approach that assumes self-preservation. Then we use eddy-flux data from two sites in contrasting climates to systematically evaluate the accuracy of different upscaling proposals within the framework. We assumed that the instantaneous estimate of the latent heat flux measured by the eddy-flux technique would have been measured by a satellite sensor. We then scaled this estimate to a monthly period using four approaches and compared the result with the observed monthly integral. This design enabled us to isolate the accuracy of each upscaling method. The four methods upscaled lambda(E) by: (i) observed solar irradiance (S): (ii) modelled solar irradiance from a sine function (S-SIN): (iii) modelled top-of-atmosphere solar irradiance (S-TOA); and (iv) observed available energy (A(E)). We showed that upscaling lambda(E) using observed data (S, A(E)) resulted in underestimation of monthly evaporative energy. while the use of modelled data (S-SIN, S-TOA) led to overestimation, primarily due to the relationship between error and both the season (day-of-year) and cloud fraction. Of the two observed fluxes, upscaling with S resulted in lower overall errors than when using A(E) (S bias: -1.11 MJ m(-2) d(-1) or -16%; A(E) bias: -2.15 M J m(-2) d(-1) or -34%). Of the two modelled fluxes, upscaling with S-TOA had lower errors than the widely used S-SIN method (S-SIN bias: 1.03 M J m(-2) d(-1) or 14%; S-TOA bias: 0.91 M J m(-2) d(-1) or 13%). We subsequently developed a simple procedure to minimise bias from all four upscaling approaches, and concluded that modelled data (S-TOA) can be used to upscale lambda(E) to longer timescales for thermal remote sensing applications. This study developed the theory to minimise upscaling bias at two sites with contrasting climates, further work is needed to extend the approach to all global terrestrial climates.

AB Premise of the study: The function of most ecosystems has been altered by human activities. To asses the recovery of plant communities, we must evaluate the recovery of plant functional traits. The seasonally dry tropical forest (SDTF), a highly threatened ecosystem, is assumed to recover relatively quickly from disturbance, but an integrated evaluation of recovery in floristic, structural, and functional terms has not been performed. In this study we aimed to (a) compare SDTF plant functional, floristic, and structural change along succession; (b) identify tree functional groups; and (c) explore the spectral properties of different successional stages.
   Methods: Across a SDTF successional gradient, we evaluated the change of species composition, vegetation structure, and leaf spectral reflectance and functional traits (related to water use, light acquisition, nutrient conservation, and CO2 acquisition) of 25 abundant tree species.
   Key results: A complete recovery of SDTF takes longer than the time period inferred from floristic or structural data. Plant functional traits changed along succession from those that maximize photoprotection and heat dissipation in early succession, where temperature is an environmental constraint, to those that enhance light acquisition in late succession, where light may be limiting. A spectral indicator of plant photosynthetic performance (photochemical reflectance index) discriminated between early and late succession. This constitutes a foundation for further exploration of remote sensing technologies for studying tropical succession.
   Conclusions: A functional approach should be incorporated as a regular descriptor of forest succession because it provides a richer understanding of vegetation dynamics than is offered by either the floristic or structural approach alone.

AB The influence of habitat fragmentation on mating patterns and progeny fitness in trees is critical for understanding the long-term impact of contemporary landscape change on the sustainability of biodiversity. We examined the relationship between mating patterns, using microsatellites, and fitness of progeny, in a common garden trial, for the insect-pollinated big-leaf mahogany, Swietenia macrophylla King, sourced from forests and isolated trees in 16 populations across Central America. As expected, isolated trees had disrupted mating patterns and reduced fitness. However, for dry provenances, fitness was negatively related to correlated paternity, while for mesic provenances, fitness was correlated positively with outcrossing rate and negatively with correlated paternity. Poorer performance of mesic provenances is likely because of reduced effective pollen donor density due to poorer environmental suitability and greater disturbance history. Our results demonstrate a differential shift in reproductive assurance and inbreeding costs in mahogany, driven by exploitation history and contemporary landscape context.

AB In many socially monogamous species, females copulate with and produce offspring sired by males other than their social mates, yet it remains controversial whether or how females benefit from these 'extrapair' copulations. Recently, it has been suggested that females might benefit if they are able to copulate with extrapair males that are genetically dissimilar to themselves, thereby potentially increasing the heterozygosity and/or reducing the level of inbreeding of the resulting offspring. However, empirical tests of this hypothesis have been criticized because a low number of molecular markers can lead to biased estimates of relatedness among individuals, and because all studies to date have been correlational and therefore unable to rule out potentially confounding factors. The red-backed fairy-wren is a bird with very limited dispersal, and hence the risks of inbreeding are high. We used a panel of microsatellite markers to examine paternity and relatedness between mates in this species, and also conducted an experiment that manipulated relatedness between a female and her social mate. Results from both approaches showed that females paired to genetically similar males were more likely to produce young sired by extrapair males, and that those offspring were less inbred (more heterozygous) than within-pair offspring. Thus, female fairy-wrens are able to avoid the potential costs of close inbreeding through extrapair copulations. (C) 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

TI Species-Specific Effects of Epigeic Earthworms on Microbial Community
   Structure during First Stages of Decomposition of Organic Matter

AB Background: Epigeic earthworms are key organisms in organic matter decomposition because of the interactions they establish with microorganisms. The earthworm species and the quality and/or substrate availability are expected to be major factors influencing the outcome of these interactions. Here we tested whether and to what extent the epigeic earthworms Eisenia andrei, Eisenia fetida and Perionyx excavatus, widely used in vermicomposting, are capable of altering the microbiological properties of fresh organic matter in the short-term. We also questioned if the earthworm-induced modifications to the microbial communities are dependent on the type of substrate ingested.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: To address these questions we determined the microbial community structure (phospholipid fatty acid profiles) and microbial activity (basal respiration and microbial growth rates) of three types of animal manure (cow, horse and rabbit) that differed in microbial composition, after being processed by each species of earthworm for one month. No differences were found between earthworm-worked samples with regards to microbial community structure, irrespective of type of manure, which suggests the existence of a bottleneck effect of worm digestion on microbial populations of the original material consumed. Moreover, in mesocosms containing cow manure the presence of E. andrei resulted not only in a decrease in bacterial and fungal biomass, but also in a reduced bacterial growth rate and total microbial activity, while no such reduction was found with E. fetida and P. excavatus.
   Conclusions/Significance: Our results point to the species of earthworm with its associated gut microbiota as a strong determinant of the process shaping the structure of microbial communities in the short-term. This must nonetheless be weighed against the fact that further knowledge is necessary to evaluate whether the changes in the composition of microbiota in response to the earthworm species is accompanied by a change in the microbial community diversity and/or function.

AB Molecular epidemiology, broadly defined, is the application of molecular genetic techniques to the dynamics of disease in a population. In this review, we briefly describe molecular and analytical tools available for molecular epidemiological studies and then provide an overview of how they can be applied to better understand parasitic disease. A range of new molecular tools have been developed in recent years, allowing for the direct examination of parasites from clinical or environmental samples, and providing access to relatively cheap, rapid, high throughput molecular assays. At the same time, new analytical approaches, in particular those derived from coalescent theory, have been developed to provide more robust estimates of evolutionary processes and demographic parameters from multilocus, genotypic data. To date, the primary application of molecular epidemiology has been to provide specific and sensitive identification of parasites and to resolve taxonomic issues, particularly at the species level and below. Population genetic studies have also been used to determine the extent of genetic diversity among populations of parasites and the degree to which this diversity is associated with different host cycles or epidemiologically important phenotypes. Many of these studies have also shed new light on transmission cycles of parasites, particularly the extent to which zoonotic transmission occurs, and on the prevalence and importance of mixed infections with different parasite species or intraspecific variants (polyparasitism). A major challenge, and one which is now being addressed by an increasing number of studies, is to find and utilize genetic markers for complex traits of epidemiological significance, such as drug resistance, zoonotic potential and virulence.

AB The intensity and speed of human alterations to the planets ecosystems are yielding our static, ahistorical view of biodiversity obsolete. Human actions frequently trigger fast evolutionary responses, affect extant genetic variation and result in the establishment of new communities and co-evolutionary networks for which we lack past analogues. Contemporary evolution interplays with ecological changes to determine the response of organisms and ecosystems to anthropogenic pressures. Examples on wild species include responses to harvest (e.g. fisheries, hunting, angling), habitat loss and fragmentation (e.g. genetic effects of isolation), biotic exchange (e.g. evolutionary responses to control measures), climate change (e.g. local adaptation and its interplay with dispersal processes) and the responses of endangered species to conservation measures. A review of international and EU biodiversity policies showed numerous opportunities for the integration of evolutionary knowledge, with the realistic prospect of improving their efficacy. Such opportunities should be extended to other sectoral policies of direct relevance for biodiversity notably nature conservation, fisheries, agriculture, water resources, spatial planning and climate change. These avenues for improvement are, however, challenged by the low level of enforcement of biodiversity policies, linked to the nonbinding nature of most biodiversity-policy documents, and the decreasing representation of biodiversity in EUs research policy.

AB There is a growing trend to include a consideration of ecosystem services, the benefits that people obtain from ecosystems, within decision frameworks. Not more than a decade ago, sediment management efforts were largely site-specific and held little attention except in terms of managing contaminant inputs and addressing sediments as a nuisance at commercial ports and harbors. Sediments figure extensively in the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment; however, contaminated sediment is not the dominant concern. Rather, the focus is on land and water use and management on the landscape scale, which can profoundly affect soil and sediment quality, quantity and fate. Habitat change and loss, due to changes in sediment inputs, whether reductions (resulting in the loss of beaches, storm protection, nutrient inputs, etc.) or increases (resulting in lake, reservoir and wetland infilling, coral reef smothering, etc.); eutrophication and reductions in nutrient inputs, and disturbance due to development and fishing practices are considered major drivers, with significant consequences for biodiversity and the provision and resilience of ecosystem functions and services. As a mobile connecting medium between various parts of the ecosystem via the hydrocycle, sediments both contaminated and uncontaminated, play both positive and negative roles in the viability and sustainability of social, economic, and ecological objectives. How these roles are interpreted depends upon whether sediment status (defined in terms of sediment quality, quantity, location and transport) is appropriate to the needs of a given endpoint; understanding and managing the dynamic interactions of sediment status on a diverse range of endpoints at the landscape or watershed scale should be the focus of sediment management. This paper seeks to provide a language and conceptual framework upon which sediment-ecosystem regional assessments (SEcoRAs) can be developed in support of that goal. (C) 2011 Elsevier By.

The experiment was establishment with eight treatments: without rock P and K materials or bacteria inoculation (control), rock P (RP), rock K (RK), RP + PDB, RK+ KDB and R(P + K)+(P + K) DB. Under the same conditions of this study, co-inoculation of PDB and KDB in conjunction with direct application of rock P and K materials (R(P + K)) into the soil increased P and K availability and uptake, and the plant growth (shoot and root growth) of maize plants grown on P and K limited soils.

AB Effective conservation of large carnivores requires reliable estimates of population density, often obtained through capturerecapture analysis, in order to prioritize investments and assess conservation intervention effectiveness. Recent statistical advances and development of user-friendly software for spatially explicit capturerecapture (SECR) circumvent the difficulties in estimating effective survey area, and hence density, from capturerecapture data. We conducted a camera-trapping study on leopards (Panthera pardus) in Mondulkiri Protected Forest, Cambodia. We compared density estimates using SECR with those obtained from conventional approaches in which the effective survey area is estimated using a boundary strip width based on observed animal movements. Density estimates from Chao heterogeneity models (3.8 +/- SE 1.9 individuals/100 km2) and Pledger heterogeneity models and models accounting for gender-specific capture and recapture rates (model-averaged density 3.9 +/- SE 2.9 individuals/100 km2) were similar to those from SECR in program DENSITY (3.6 +/- SE 1.0/100 km2) but higher than estimates from Jack-knife heterogeneity models (2.9 +/- SE 0.9individuals/100 km2). Capture probabilities differed between male and female leopards probably resulting from differences in the use of human-made trails between sexes. Given that there are a number of biologically plausible reasons to expect gender-specific variation in capture probabilities of large carnivores, we recommend exploratory analysis of data using models in which gender can be included as a covariate affecting capture probabilities particularly given the demographic importance of breeding females for population recovery of threatened carnivores.

AB Apomixis, the asexual reproduction via seed, has long been regarded a blind alley of evolution. This hypothesis was based on the assumption that apomixis is an irreversible, phylogenetically derived trait that would rapidly lead to extinction of the respective lineages. However, recent updates of the taxonomic distribution of apomixis in angiosperms suggest an alternative evolutionary scenario. Apomixis is taxonomically scattered and occurs in both early and late branching lineages, with several reversals from apomixis to obligate sex along phylogeny. Genetic control of apomixis is based on altered expression patterns of the same genes that control sexual development; epigenetic changes following polyploidization and/or hybridization may trigger shifts from sexuality to apomixis. Mendelian inheritance confirms the facultative nature and possible reversibility of apomixis to sexual reproduction. Apomixis, therefore, could represent a transition period in the evolution of polyploid complexes, with polyspory in paleopolyploids being a remnant of lost apomixis. In neopolyploids, apomixis helps to overcome sterility and allows for geographical range expansions of agamic polyploid complexes. The facultative nature of apomixis allows for reversal to sexuality and further speciation of paleopolyploid lineages. Thus, apomixis may facilitate diversification of polyploid complexes and evolution in angiosperms.

AB Roads have been associated with decreased reproductive success and biodiversity in avian communities and increased physiological stress in adult birds. Alternatively, roads may also increase food availability and reduce predator pressure. Previous studies have focused on adult birds, but nestlings may also be susceptible to the detrimental impacts of roads. We examined the effects of proximity to a road on nestling glucocorticoid activity and growth in the mountain white-crowned sparrow (Zonotrichia leucophrys oriantha). Additionally, we examined several possible indirect factors that may influence nestling corticosterone (CURT) activity secretion in relation to roads. These indirect effects include parental CURT activity, nest-site characteristics, and parental provisioning. And finally, we assessed possible fitness consequences of roads through measures of fledging success. Nestlings near roads had increased CURT activity, elevated at both baseline and stress-induced levels. Surprisingly, these nestlings were also bigger. Generally, greater corticosterone activity is associated with reduced growth. However, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis matures through the nestling period (as nestlings get larger, HPA-activation is greater). Although much of the variance in CURT responses was explained by body size, nestling CURT responses were higher close to roads after controlling for developmental differences. Indirect effects of roads may be mediated through paternal care. Nestling CURT responses were correlated with paternal CURT responses and paternal provisioning increased near roads. Hence, nestlings near roads may be larger due to increased paternal attentiveness. And finally, nest predation was higher for nests close to the road. Roads have apparent costs for white-crowned sparrow nestlings - increased predation, and apparent benefits - increased size. The elevation in CURT activity seems to reflect both increased size (benefit) and elevation due to road proximity (cost). Whether or not roads are good or bad for nestlings remains equivocal. However, it is clear that roads affect nestlings; how or if these effects influence adult survival or reproduction remains to be elucidated. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The central tenet of biodiversity-ecosystem function (BEF) theory, that species richness increases function, could motivate restoration practitioners to incorporate a greater number of species into their projects. But it is not yet clear how well BEF theory predicts outcomes of restoration, because it has been developed through tests involving short-run and tightly controlled (e. g., weeded) experiments. Thus, we resampled our 1997 BEF experiment in a restored salt marsh to test for long-term effects of species richness (plantings with 1, 3, and 6 species per 2 3 2 m plot), with multiple ecosystem functions as response variables. Over 11 years, 1- and 6-species assemblages converged on intermediate richness (mean 3.9 species/0.25-m 2 plot), and composition changed nonrandomly throughout the site. While three species became rare, the two most productive species became co-dominant. The two dominants controlled and increased shoot biomass, which appeared to decrease species richness. Diversity-function relationships became less positive over 11 years and differed significantly with (a) the species-richness metric (planted vs. measured), and (b) the indicator of function (shoot biomass, height, and canopy layering). The loss of positive relationships between species richness and function in our restored site began soon after we stopped weeding and continued with increasing dominance by productive species. Where species-rich plantings are unlikely to ensure long-term restoration of functions, as in our salt marsh, we recommend dual efforts to establish (1) dominant species that provide high levels of target functions, and (2) subordinate species, which might provide additional functions under current or future conditions.

AB A semi-hydroponic bin system was developed to provide an efficient phenotyping platform for studying root architecture. The system was designed to accommodate a large number of plants in a small area for screening genotypes. It was constructed using inexpensive and easily obtained materials: 240 Lplastic mobile bins, clear acrylic panels covered with black calico cloth and a controlled watering system. A screening experiment for root traits of 20 wild genotypes of narrow-leafed lupin (Lupinus angustifolius L.) evaluated the reliability and efficiency of the system. Root architecture, root elongation rate and branching patterns were monitored for 6 weeks. Significant differences in both architectural and morphological traits were observed among tested genotypes, particularly for total root length, branch number, specific root length and branch density. Results demonstrated that the bin system was efficient in screening root traits in narrow-leafed lupin, allowing for rapid measurement of two-dimensional root architecture over time with minimal disturbance to plant growth and without destructive root sampling. The system permits mapping and digital measurement of dynamic growth of taproot and lateral roots. This phenotyping platform is a desirable tool for examining root architecture of deep root systems and large sets of plants in a relatively small space.

AB Eutrophication is a threat to wetlands worldwide. Elevated phosphorus concentration is often the main driver of loss of biodiversity and ecosystem function, but effects of phosphorus and nitrogen have proved largely inseparable, because they vary colinearly. Charophytes, aquatic algae that are very close to the evolutionary link with the land-plant lineage, provide a sensitive system for disentangling complex pollutant threats.
   Here, we investigated aquatic vegetation and water quality at the principal sites for charophyte biodiversity in the UK and used hierarchical partitioning to discriminate independent effects of pollutants on their occurrence. A laboratory experiment examined the growth responses of a representative species (Chara globularis) to nitrate.
   Nitrate-N exerted the greatest detrimental effect on charophyte occurrence in the field. Furthermore, growth of C. globularis in the laboratory was inhibited above very low concentrations. Smaller independent effects of copper (Cu), cadmium (Cd), cobalt (Co), phosphate-P, nickel (Ni), boron (B) and manganese (Mn) on charophyte occurrence were discriminated.
   It is possible to separate the deleterious effects of phosphorus and nitrogen on aquatic organisms in the field. Nitrate is a critical factor and a mean annual average concentration limit of c. 2 mg l(-1) nitrate-N is necessary to protect charophytes and their services within wetland ecosystems.

AB Australia's aquatic ecosystems are unique, supporting a high diversity of species and high levels of endemism; however, they are also extremely vulnerable to climate change. The present review assesses climate-induced changes to structural habitats that have occurred in different aquatic ecosystems. Climatic impacts are often difficult to discern against the background of habitat degradation caused by more direct anthropogenic impacts. However, climate impacts will become more pronounced with ongoing changes in temperature, water chemistry, sea level, rainfall patterns and ocean currents. Each of these factors is likely to have specific effects on ecosystems, communities or species, and their relative importance varies across different marine and freshwater habitats. In the Murray-Darling Basin, the greatest concern relates to declines in surface water availability and riverine flow, owing to declining rainfall and increased evaporative loss. On the Great Barrier Reef, increasing temperatures and ocean acidification contribute to sustained and ongoing loss of habitat-forming corals. Despite the marked differences in major drivers and consequences of climate change, the solution is always the same. Greenhouse-gas emissions need to be reduced as a matter of urgency, while also minimising non-climatic disturbances. Together, these actions will maximise opportunities for adaptation by species and increase ecosystem resilience.

TI What drives invasibility? A multi-model inference test and spatial
   modelling of alien plant species richness patterns in northern Portugal
SO ECOGRAPHY
LA English
DT Article
ID INVASIONS; CONSERVATION; RISK; TOOL
AB Understanding and predicting biological invasions can focus either on traits that favour species invasiveness or on features of the receiving communities, habitats or landscapes that promote their invasibility. Here, we address invasibility at the regional scale, testing whether some habitats and landscapes are more invasible than others by fitting models that relate alien plant species richness to various environmental predictors. We use a multi-model information-theoretic approach to assess invasibility by modelling spatial and ecological patterns of alien invasion in landscape mosaics, and by testing competing hypotheses of environmental factors that may control invasibility. Because invasibility may be mediated by particular characteristics of invasiveness, we classified alien species according to their C-S-R plant strategies. We illustrate this approach with a set of 86 alien species in northern Portugal. We first focus on predictors influencing species richness and expressing invasibility, and then evaluate whether distinct plant strategies respond to the same or different groups of environmental predictors. We confirmed climate as a primary determinant of alien invasions, and as a primary environmental gradient determining landscape invasibility. The effects of secondary gradients were detected only when the area was sub-sampled according to predictions based on the primary gradient. Then, multiple predictor types influenced patterns of alien species richness, with some types (landscape composition, topography and fire regime) prevailing over others. Alien species richness responded most strongly to extreme land management regimes, suggesting that intermediate disturbance induces biotic resistance by favouring native species richness. Land-use intensification facilitated alien invasion, whereas conservation areas hosted few invaders, highlighting the importance of ecosystem stability in preventing invasions. Plants with different strategies exhibited different responses to environmental gradients, particularly when the variations of the primary gradient were narrowed by sub-sampling. Such differential responses of plant strategies suggest using distinct control and eradication approaches for different areas and alien plant groups.

AB To simulate the effect of temperature on soil respiration rates, we translocated soil cores among four sites (3030, 1500, 1000, and 200 m asl) along an altitudinal tropical forest gradient in the Peruvian Andes, traversing a difference in mean annual temperature of 13.9 degrees C. Rates of total (R-s) and heterotrophic (R-sh) respiration were measured twice a month from April 2007 to March 2009 and additionally for full 24 h periods. The diurnal range in R-s increased with altitude; this variation was mainly root and litter derived, whereas R-sh varied only slightly over full 24 h periods. Although mean annual daytime R-s rates were not significantly different among the four sites (4.45-4.05 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1)), the annual amount of respired C decreased with increasing altitude from 1639 g C m(-2) yr(-1) at 200 m asl to 1064 g C m(-2) yr(-1) at 3030 m asl. The contribution of R-sh to R-s was not correlated with elevation and ranged from 25% to 60%. The temperature dependence of R-s was lower at the midelevation sites (Q(10) of 2.07 and 2.94 at 1500 and 1000 m asl, respectively) than at the highest and lowest sites of the gradient (Q(10) of 4.33 and 6.92 at 3030 and 200 m asl, respectively). The temperature sensitivity of R-sh was higher for the sites at 3030 and 200 m asl and increased with time, i.e., with the loss of the most labile C pools.

Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi host plant wheat was cultivated in the first vegetation period and non-host amaranth in the second. Phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA) were used to assess soil microbial biomass and community structure. AM fungi were quantified using the marker fatty acid 16:1 omega 5, with its occurrence in soil PLFAs representing hyphae and in neutral lipid fatty acid (NLFA) spores. Soil microbial biomass was enhanced by the addition of manure and at higher amounts for both fertilizers. AM fungal hyphae and spore biomass responded positively to manure application. The soil microbial community under both crops was dominated by bacteria. The ratio of fungal to bacterial (f/b) PLFAs increased with higher fertilizer amounts but decreased in amaranth plots with the application of manure. Meanwhile the ratio of Gram+/Gram- bacteria indicating environmental conditions (e.g. pH, temperature) was higher in amaranth plots with the addition of manure as compared to wheat plots. Soil PLFA revealed distinct effect of crop type displayed by changes in the occurrence of saturated fatty acids and biomarkers for Gram-negative bacteria and saprotrophic fungi. The latter additionally accounted for the dissimilarity between fertilizer treatments. In sum, the soil PLFA pattern distinctively separated wheat from amaranth plots at 0-5 cm soil depth, indicating a stronger effect of crop rotation and crop identity on soil microorganisms than long-term fertilizer practice.

TI Bioclimate envelope model predictions for natural resource management:
   dealing with uncertainty

AB Bioclimate envelope models are widely used to predict the potential distribution of species under climate change, but they are conceptually also suitable to match policies and practices to anticipated or observed climate change, for example through species choice in reforestation. Projections of bioclimate envelope models, however, come with large uncertainties due to different climate change scenarios, modelling methods and other factors.
   2 In this paper we present a novel approach to evaluate uncertainty in model-based recommendations for natural resource management. Rather than evaluating variability in modelling results as a whole, we extract a particular statistic of interest from multiple model runs, e.g. species suitability for a particular reforestation site. Then, this statistic is subjected to analysis of variance, aiming to narrow the range of projections that practitioners need to consider.
   3. In four case studies for western Canada we evaluate five sources of uncertainty with two to five treatment levels, including modelling methods, interpolation type for climate data, inclusion of topo-edaphic variables, choice of general circulation models, and choice of emission scenarios. As dependent variables, we evaluate changes to tree species habitat and ecosystem distributions under 144 treatment combinations.
   4. For these case studies, we find that the inclusion of topo-edaphic variables as predictors reduces projected habitat shifts by a quarter, and general circulation models had major main effects. Our contrasting modelling approaches primarily contributed to uncertainty through interaction terms with climate change predictions, i.e. the methods behaved differently for particular climate change scenarios (e.g. warm & moist scenarios) but similar for others.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Partitioning of variance components helps with the interpretation of modelling results and reveals how models can most efficiently be improved. Quantifying variance components for main effects and interactions among sources of uncertainty also offers researchers the opportunity to filter out biologically and statistically unreasonable modelling results, providing practitioners with an improved range of predictions for climate-informed natural resource management.

AB Genetic diversity of feral and ranch American mink was studied in order to understand the processes of invasion and the possible influence of multiple introductions on the feral mink population in Poland. Tissue samples obtained from feral mink taken from 10 sites across Poland (196) and from ranch mink at nine mink farms (147) were genotyped at 14 microsatellite loci. Genetic differentiation among the separate regions and sites indicated some restriction in gene flow among them (pairwise F-ST values), and greater variation at microsatellite loci for feral mink was attributed to differences among sites rather than among regions (AMOVA). A Mantel test demonstrated a positive association of pairwise genetic and geographic distances. A total of five clusters of feral mink were identified and their spatial distribution partially reflected regional distribution, but also suggested that there were other factors (human-mediated propagule pressure) shaping mink genetic structure. Feral and ranch mink belong to two genetically separate clusters and an assignment test showed that 34 feral mink (17%) were assigned to the ranch mink clusters. The proportion of feral mink assigned to ranch mink clusters correlated with the size of the farm breeding stocks in the districts where sampling sites were located. High human-mediated propagule pressure (particularly in western Poland) increases feral population genetic diversity and overwhelms genetic structure and potential management units, making the control of mink populations less successful. Our results indicate that reducing number of escapees from farms should be required management action. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The sub-discipline of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning (BEF) has emerged as a central topic in contemporary ecological research. However, to date no study has evaluated the prominence and publication biases in BEF research. Herein we report the results of a careful quantitative assessment of BEF research published in five core general ecology journals from 1990 to 2007 to determine the position of BEF research within ecology, identify patterns of research effort within BEF research, and discuss their probable proximal and historical causes. The relative importance of BEF publications increased exponentially during the period analyzed and was significantly greater than the average growth of ecological literature, affirming the prominence of BEF as a current paradigm in ecology. However, BEF research exhibited a strong bias toward experimental studies on terrestrial plant communities, with significantly lower effort devoted to the functional aspects of biodiversity in aquatic systems, multiple trophic level systems, and animal or microbial communities. Such trends may be explained by a combination of methodological adequacy and historic epistemological differences in ecological thinking. We suggest that BEF researchers should direct more effort toward the study of aquatic systems and animal communities, emphasize long-term and trophically complex experiments, such as those with multi-trophic microbial communities, employ larger-scale field observational studies and increase the use of integrative and theoretical studies. Many technical and analytical methodologies that are already employed in ecological research, such as stable isotopes, paleobiology, remote sensing, and model selection criteria, can facilitate these aims. Overcoming the above-mentioned shortcomings of current BEF research will greatly improve our ability to predict how biodiversity loss will affect ecosystem processes and services in natural ecosystems.

AB Background: The effect of alignment gaps on phylogenetic accuracy has been the subject of numerous studies. In this study, we investigated the relationship between the total number of gapped sites and phylogenetic accuracy, when the gaps were introduced (by means of computer simulation) to reflect indel (insertion/deletion) events during the evolution of DNA sequences. The resulting (true) alignments were subjected to commonly used gap treatment and phylogenetic inference methods.
   Results: (1) In general, there was a strong - almost deterministic - relationship between the amount of gap in the data and the level of phylogenetic accuracy when the alignments were very "gappy", (2) gaps resulting from deletions (as opposed to insertions) contributed more to the inaccuracy of phylogenetic inference, (3) the probabilistic methods (Bayesian, PhyML & "ML epsilon, "a method implemented in DNAML in PHYLIP) performed better at most levels of gap percentage when compared to parsimony (MP) and distance (NJ) methods, with Bayesian analysis being clearly the best, (4) methods that treat gapped sites as missing data yielded less accurate trees when compared to those that attribute phylogenetic signal to the gapped sites (by coding them as binary character data - presence/absence, or as in the ML epsilon method), and (5) in general, the accuracy of phylogenetic inference depended upon the amount of available data when the gaps resulted from mainly deletion events, and the amount of missing data when insertion events were equally likely to have caused the alignment gaps.
   Conclusion: When gaps in an alignment are a consequence of indel events in the evolution of the sequences, the accuracy of phylogenetic analysis is likely to improve if: (1) alignment gaps are categorized as arising from insertion events or deletion events and then treated separately in the analysis, (2) the evolutionary signal provided by indels is harnessed in the phylogenetic analysis, and (3) methods that utilize the phylogenetic signal in indels are developed for distance methods too. When the true homology is known and the amount of gaps is 20 percent of the alignment length or less, the methods used in this study are likely to yield trees with 90-100 percent accuracy.

AB The precise knowledge of ecological resources and conditions required by species threatened by rapidly changing environmental conditions is of prime importance for conservation biology. Transferability of this knowledge between species with similar ecological requirements is often assumed, but rarely tested. This is especially the case for glacial relict populations confined to climate-habitat traps from where they cannot move to rejoin areas with suitable environmental conditions. Using two glacial relict butterflies as model organisms, we first quantitatively define larval and adult resource-based habitat use of each species. Secondly, we test the transferability of ecological profiles (both habitat and ecological niche) between these two species that share both the same biotope and the same host plant. Our results show that both species have markedly different ecological requirements relating to differences in life history and behavioural traits (i.e. egg-laying strategies and mate-locating behaviour). Although the two species share many ecological features, they use different functional habitats within our study site. The high degree of interspecific niche overlap should indicate a high interspecific competition. However, we argue that their co-existence can be explained by the non-limiting abundance of some resources (e.g. host plants), by the partial separation in time of adult flight periods and by the territorial behaviour of one of the species. We discuss the following general messages: (1) functional habitat of a (threatened) species should be defined in a spatial context corresponding to individual station keeping, and (2) quick diagnosis based on similar ecological requirements may be misleading for the design of reliable conservation and restoration strategies. Detailed mechanistic and quantitative ecological understanding of resource-use and environmental tolerances across an organism's life cycle is essential for effective conservation in changing environments, like for glacial relict species.

AB Extrapair paternity may create marked variation in the reproductive success of males and thus contribute to the evolution of sexually selected traits in socially monogamous mating systems. We examined the distribution of extrapair paternity in a passerine bird, the pied flycatcher, in relation to plumage coloration and male age. The frequency of extrapair paternity was found to be low in our study population in Southwest Finland (38 of 857 (4.4%) offspring in 25 of 191 (13%) broods). We were able to identify the sire for 53% of the extrapair young and in each case the extrapair sire was at least 2 years old. The probability of siring extrapair young was not associated with pigment-based brown-black dorsal plumage coloration, structural ultraviolet (UV) coloration or forehead patch size. The probability of being cuckolded, however, increased with decreasing UV chroma of the white wing patch. Our results thus indicate that there are multiple factors influencing when and with whom females engage in extrapair copulations. They also indicate that the male traits influencing the decision to cuckold the social mate are different from those used for choosing an extrapair mate.

AB P>Pollen to ovule (P : O) ratios have been hypothesized to correlate with the degree of outcrossing and thus with the mating system of a plant. Also, P : O ratios are likely to vary with respect to pollination mode (i.e. wind pollination or animal pollination). Furthermore, constraints on the evolution of mating systems depending on life form may affect P : O ratios.
   We compiled P : O ratios and outcrossing rates for 107 angiosperm species and analyzed the relation between these traits considering pollination mode, life form and phylogenetic relatedness among species.
   In general, P : O ratios correlated significantly with outcrossing rates. However, when taking additional factors into account, the relation became ambiguous. The correlation was significantly positive in wind-pollinated species, but only marginally so in animal-pollinated species. Wind-pollinated species had higher P : O ratios than animal-pollinated taxa. In woody perennials, outcrossing was the predominant mating system and outcrossing rates did not correlate with P : O ratios. The results were not altered by accounting for phylogenetic relatedness among species.
   The results indicate that P : O ratios vary more strongly with pollination mode and life form than with the mating system.

AB In North America broad-based research networks explore the interaction of vertebrates, their characteristic arrays of pathogens and emergent disease. A diversity of programmes address the impact of environmental change on animal health, zoonoses, and human health, but as yet no comprehensive framework or strategy has emerged to develop and implement policy and planning. In a regime of climate change and ecological perturbation, the need to document and understand the health, agricultural, societal and economic impact of pathogens and emerging infectious disease is urgent. An integrated and proactive planning process linking national and international resources can lead to informed predictions about the impact of environmental change and can identify pathways for potential management and mitigation. An effective and comprehensive programme will have components for establishing priorities, developing primary data for faunal structure and biodiversity, a capacity for monitoring and surveillance (including scanning and targeted activities), and linkage to historical and contemporary baselines (against which to assess change) established through archival biological collections. Field and laboratory studies are also necessary to determine developmental thresholds, tolerances and tipping points for many pathogens to establish a context for recognising current constraints and future perturbation, and to explore factors that promote emergence for a variety of pathogens, vectors and pest species. Predictive modelling and risk assessment utilising a range of scenarios for climate change is a final step in this multidisciplinary process.

AB Many populations of lake sturgeon Acipenser fulvescens have decreased in size throughout the Great Lakes basin. To implement management strategies such as stocking, it is important to understand the genetic structure of lake sturgeon spawning populations. Lake sturgeon from 27 spawning locations (25 from the Great Lakes basin and 2 from the Hudson Bay drainage) were analyzed using 12 microsatellite loci. Population structure was detected at different spatial scales. At the largest scale, consistent genetic breaks were observed among three clusters of spawning populations: (1) Hudson Bay-northern Lake Superior, (2) southern Lake Superior, and (3) the rest of the Great Lakes. These clusters were identified using a Bayesian approach that does not define the populations a priori. Within each of the three clusters, sublevels of genetic structure were detected. These sublevel clusters accounted for 8.82% of the genetic variation (P < 0.000), while differences among populations within the clusters accounted for 3.72% of the genetic variation (P < 0.000). At the smallest scale, significant genetic differentiation was detected between most sampled locations through pairwise genetic differentiation index (F-ST) tests and pairwise contingency tests. Lake sturgeon showed greater genetic differentiation in Lake Superior than elsewhere, which could be due to the lake's bathymetry. The lower genetic resolution observed elsewhere in the Great Lakes could be due to more recent colonization events. The results can be used to delineate management units and to select appropriate donor populations for supplementation or reintroductions.

AB Aim Species can respond to global climate change by range shifts or by phenotypic adaptation. At the community level, range shifts lead to a turnover of species, i.e. community reassembly. In contrast, phenotypic adaptation allows species to persist in situ, conserving community composition. So far, community reassembly and adaptation have mostly been studied separately. In nature, however, both processes take place simultaneously. In migratory birds, climate change has been shown to result in both exchange of species and adaptation of migratory behaviour. The aim of our study is to predict the impact of global climate change on migratory bird communities and to assess the extent to which reassembly and adaptation may contribute to alterations.
   Location Europe.
   Methods We analysed the relationship between current climate and the proportion of migratory species across bird assemblages in Europe. The magnitude of community reassembly was measured using spatial variation in the proportion of potentially migratory species. Adaptation was inferred from spatial variation in the proportion of potentially migratory species that actually migrate at a specific site. These spatial relationships were used to make temporal predictions of changes in migratory species under global climate change.
   Results According to our models, increasing winter temperature is expected to lead to declines in the proportion of migratory species, whereas increasing spring temperature and decreasing spring precipitation may lead to increases. Changes in winter and spring temperature are expected to cause mainly adaptation in migratory activity, while changes in spring precipitation may result in both changes in the proportion of potentially migratory species and adaptation of migratory activity.
   Main conclusions Under current climate change forecasts, changes in the proportion of migratory species will be modest and the communities of migratory birds in Europe are projected to be altered through adaptation of migratory activity rather than through exchange of species.

AB Background and Aims Molecular evidence for natural primary hybrids composed of three different plant species is very rarely reported. An investigation was therefore carried out into the origin and a possible scenario for the rise of a sterile plant clone showing a combination of diagnostic morphological features of three separate, well-defined Potamogeton species.
   Methods The combination of sequences from maternally inherited cytoplasmic (rpl20-rps12) and biparentally inherited nuclear ribosomal DNA (ITS) was used to identify the exact identity of the putative triple hybrid.
   Key Results Direct sequencing showed ITS variants of three parental taxa, P. gramineus, P. lucens and P. pe perfoliatus, whereas chloroplast DNA identified P. perfoliatus) as the fernamale parent. A scenario for the rise of the triple hybrid through a fertile binary hybrid P. gramineus x P. lucens crossed with P. perfoliatus is described.
   Conclusions Even though the triple hybrid is sterile, it possesses an efficient strategy for its existence and became locally successful even in the parental environment. perhaps as a result of heterosis. The population investigated is the only one known of this hybrid, P. x torssanderi, worldwide. Isozyme analysis indicated the colony to be genetically uniform. The plants studied represented a single clone that seems to have persisted at this site for a long time.

AB A group of researchers, managers, and tribal leaders with extensive local knowledge from Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, and Papua, Indonesia, provided new information on the status of leatherback nesting populations in the western Pacific Ocean. Twenty-eight nesting sites were identified, of which 21 were previously unknown or poorly described. Although data are still incomplete, we estimate a total of ca. 5000-9200 nests currently laid each year among these 28 sites, with approximately 75% of this nesting activity concentrated at 4 sites along the northwest coast (Bird's Head Peninsula) of Papua, Indonesia. Genetic analysis by using mitochondrial deoxyribonucleic acid sequences identified a total of 6 haplotypes among the 106 samples analyzed for Solomon Islands, Papua, and Papua New Guinea, including a unique common haplotype that is only found in these western Pacific populations. There was no significant difference in haplotype frequencies among these rookeries, which suggests that they represent a metapopulation composed of a single genetic stock. Further work is needed to define the demographic structure within this metapopulation.

AB Genetic methods for estimating effective population size (N-e) or the effective number of breeders (N-b) have become popular, but comparisons of these estimates with demographic estimates of N-e and N-b are rare, especially in anurans. We used three genetic (linkage disequilibrium, temporal moments, Bayesian coalescent-based method) and three demographic models, the latter considering number of breeding individuals, sex ratio, reproductive skew, and other demographic data, to estimate N-e and N-b in two subarctic populations (T and P) of the common frog Rana temporaria, subject to long-term capture-recapture studies. Demographic estimates of N-e based on total population size (N-e[T] = 44.5-569; N-e[P] = 68.8-93.7) deviated markedly from the genetic estimates obtained using the linkage disequilibrium method (N-e[T] = 97.1; N-e[P] = 13.2). The demographic estimates of N-b, taking into consideration sex ratio and variance in reproductive success (N-b[T] = 10.1-39.7; N-b[P] = 3.9-21.3), were higher than the genetic estimates (N-b[T] = 3.7-5.4; N-b[P] = 3.5-3.9). The main factors affecting the effective size estimates were sex ratio and reproductive skew. The discrepancies between corresponding N-e and N-b estimates highlight the sensitivity of both demographic and genetic estimates on their underlying assumptions. Yet the ratios of effective or breeding effective size to the census population size were similar to those reported earlier for anurans, reinforcing the view that the discrepancy between actual and effective breeding sizes in anuran populations is typically very large.

AB The frequency and intensity of salvage logging has recently increased in burned forests of the Canadian boreal so that post-fire areas make up a significant annual share of all harvested forest land in some years. However, little is known about how this practice affects re-establishment of animal and plant communities that already have been strongly altered by the fire. We pitfall-trapped carabid beetles (Coleoptera, Carabidae) for two consecutive years following a large-scale boreal wildfire (276,000 ha) in burned mixed-wood forests of 12 landscape units (2.5 km x 2.5 km each). These units included four salvage treatments, each replicated three times: control (no salvaging), low (ca. 20-30% of merchantable mixed-wood removed), moderate (40-50%) and high salvage intensity (60-70%). We established 16 sampling sites in each unit: on the control landscapes, all 16 sites were in un-logged stands; in low-salvage units, 4 out of 16 sites were in salvaged areas; in moderate- and high-salvage units, 8 and 12 out of 16 sites, respectively, were in salvaged areas. Salvage logging positively affected carabid species richness. However, there was an overall salvage-caused decrease in the abundance of many common forest-dwelling carabids, and an increase in the abundance of disturbance or open-habitat specialists. Interestingly, the effects of salvage logging on the total catch and several abundant forest species (e.g., Calosoma frigidum, Harpalus laevipes, Pterostichus punctatissimus, P adstrictus and Platynus decentis) appeared to be more important at the landscape level (the four landscape treatments) than at the level of sampling sites (site logged versus not). We suggest that this observation resulted from ambiguous site-level responses to salvage that collectively contributed to the (mostly negative) significant responses at the landscape level. Effects of fire severity (estimates based on tree survival) on carabids were species-specific; however, the impact of this measure was most often significant at the site, and not at the landscape, level. A Multivariate Regression Tree revealed that fire severity and the overall (pre-fire) amount of mixed-wood forest on the landscape were significant determinants of assemblage structure, with the local effects of fire severity being strongest.

AB The goliath grouper Epinephelus itajara is a large sized (> 400 kg) and critically endangered marine fish, which is protected in many countries, including Brazil. Through the application of semi-structured interviews, we investigated the local ecological knowledge of seven fishermen specialist on catching E. itajara from the Babitonga bay, Santa Catarina, Brazil. Local long-line fisheries for E. itajara seemed to be a disappearing tradition in the studied site, with a detailed inherent local ecological knowledge system, which is also being lost. Our study also showed that fishermen engaged in recent fisheries, such as spear-fishing, can also possess a detailed local ecological knowledge system. Through the analysis of fishermen local ecological knowledge, several aspects of E. itajara life history were registered. This species is found in the inner and outer Babitonga bay, from saline waters to areas with a large input of freshwater, and inhabits submerged wooden substrates and artificial reefs such as shipwrecks, mooring pillars and cargo containers. It is known to spawn in December and subsequent summer months in the studied area. Spawning aggregations are usually seen in December (during full moon), being also eventually observed in January and February by our informants. While lobsters, spadefishes and octopuses seem to constitute the most important food items of inner bay E. itajara, outer bay individuals may feed on catfishes, crustaceans and other fish species. The goliath grouper is regarded as pacific and curious fish, but frequently display agonistic behavior in the presence of divers. Based on the perception of well experienced spear fishermen, we hypothesize that E. itajara undertakes seasonal migrations from the inner to the outer bay during summer, and that the studied population is suffering from growth over-fishing. Our data provides a practical evidence of how joining scientific and local ecological knowledge will likely benefit E. itajara local conservation and management practices by adding important new biological data into the decision-making process.

AB Daphnia may respond with (in array of anti-predator defences (behavioural, morphological and life history) to a chemical cue (kairomone) exuded by its predators:fish and Chaoborus. Given the wide array of potential responses, it is an interesting question whether anti-predator defences are coupled or independent of each other. Since anti-predator responses are costly and even possessing the genetic information to respond to a certain predator n2z ht involve a cost, clones may only react to predators they co-occur with in nature. In this study, we provide evidence for an uncoupling of responses by Daphnia pulex in several anti-predator defences against Chaoborus. We were unable to detect a correlation between behavioural (migration), morphological (neck-spine induction) and life history) [growth rate, neonate size and size at first reproduction (SER)] responses. Furthermore, anti-predator responses did not always comply with what is commonly believed. We found that Daphnia clones can migate up or down when exposed to fish or Chaoborus kairomone and that population growth rate, neonate size and SFR can increase or decrease in response to Chaoborus kairomone. We also show patterns in anti. Predator defences that seem to relate to the habitat from which clones were derived. Daphnia clones that were collected in habitats with Chaoborus as the dominant predator tended to react strongly to Chaoborus kairomone by migrating upward and producing neck-spines. The migration behaviour against fish kairomone in these clones was often an unexpected upward migration. Vie Daphnia clone that co-existed with fish predators showed a downward migration in the presence of fish, as well as Chaoborus kairomone. Clones that had occurred with either both or no predators had mixed responses. We sometimes found an upward migration in combination with smaller body size as a response to Chaoborus kairomone. This may be interpreted as a behavioural defence against Chaoborus and a life-history defence against fish. Daphnia seem not to exhibit defence behaviour against predators thq, do not co-occur with. It might be costly for Daphnia to maintain genetic information to respond to these predators and protect that information from genetic drift.

AB Increasing plant species diversity could enhance forage yield, resistance to weed invasion, and soil C accumulation in grazed pastures. Three forage mixtures (2,3, or 11 species) were established on a farm in eastern Pennsylvania and grazed by dairy heifers or managed under a three-cut hay system from 1999 to 2002. Net canopy photosynthesis was measured from early April to early October 2000 to 2002. Root distribution to a depth of 60 cm was measured in mid-September each year, and soil C and N concentrations to a 15-cm depth were determined in May 1999 and September 2002. The 11-species mixture yielded 43% more forage dry matter than the two-species mixture. This difference was mainly due to the inclusion of a few highly productive forage species in the 11-species mixture. Canopy photosynthesis did not differ among mixtures in the spring, but in the summer was 50% greater in the 3- and 11-species mixtures than the two-species mixture. The 11-species mixture also had 30 to 62% greater root biomass than the other two mixtures and a greater proportion of roots in deeper soil layers. Soil C either remained unchanged or decreased, depending on species composition, with the greatest decrease occurring in the 11-species mixture. No relationship existed between changes in soil C concentration and either canopy photosynthesis or above- and below-ground productivity. Deeper rooting could reduce drought stress by increasing access to deep soil moisture. Selecting forage mixtures to include specific desirable traits, such as greater rooting depth, could result in improved pasture performance.

AB For more than a decade, climate change has been identified as an important emerging issue for protected areas. Utilising outputs from two equilibrium global vegetation models (GVMs) forced with six climate-change scenarios, this study assessed potential terrestrial biome-type change in Canada's protected area network (2,979 national parks, national wildlife areas, migratory bird sanctuaries, Ramsar sites, ecological reserves, wilderness wildlife areas and provincial parks). Vegetation-modelling results project that 37-48 percent of Canada's protected areas could experience a change in terrestrial biome type under doubled atmospheric carbon-dioxide conditions. Park and protected area planning in Canada have traditionally been founded upon enduring-feature analysis and ecoregion representation frameworks. These conservation-planning frameworks are based on climatic and biogeographic stability; assumptions that what these modelling results for Canada's protected areas and other vegetation-modelling studies indicate are untenable in an era of global climate change. implications for protected area policy and planning in Canada are also discussed.

AB Recent studies of wild animal populations have shown that estimators of neutral genetic diversity, such as mean heterozygosity, are often correlated with various fitness traits, such as survival, disease susceptibility, or reproductive success. We used two estimators of genetic diversity to explore the relationship between heterozygosity and reproductive success in male and female mandrills (Mandrillus sphinx) living in a semifree ranging setting in Gabon. Because social rank is known to influence reproductive success in both sexes, we also examined the correlation between genetic diversity and social rank in females, and acquisition of alpha status in males, as well as length of alpha male tenure. We found that heterozygous individuals showed greater reproductive success, with both females and males producing more offspring. However, heterozygosity influenced reproductive success only in dominant males, not in subordinates. Neither the acquisition of alpha status in males, nor social rank in females, was significantly correlated with heterozygosity, although more heterozygous alpha males showed longer tenure than homozygous ones. We also tested whether the benefits of greater genetic diversity were due mainly to a genome-wide effect of inbreeding depression or to heterosis at one or a few loci. Multilocus effects best explained the correlation between heterozygosity and reproductive success and tenure, indicating the occurrence of inbreeding depression in this mandrill colony.

AB Spatially density-dependent predation is a leading hypothesis describing mechanisms of population regulation in coral reef fish. However, studies supporting this hypothesis predominantly have been conducted on small, isolated patch reefs. Here, we searched for evidence of spatially density-dependent predation on the continuous reefs of the Netherlands Antilles in a study of a dominant planktivore, the blue chromis (Chromis cyanea). Across space, we quantified both the patterns of loss from site-attached aggregations of C. cyanea through time and the behavioral reaction of predators to these aggregations. Looking across C. cyanea densities, we found that loss from aggregations was not characteristic of direct density dependence, but instead was commonly inversely related to density. Individual C. cyanea in larger aggregations were less likely to be lost from the group than were individuals in smaller aggregations. Thus, the observed density dependence increased spatial heterogeneity of C. cyanea. Predators showed behaviors that were consistent with these demographic patterns. Using remote videography, we quantified predator visitation and strike rates across a range of C. cyanea aggregation sizes. Predators consistently visited and struck at individuals in C. cyanea aggregations in a pattern that was strongly inversely density dependent, suggesting that aggregation is an effective means of minimizing per capita risk of predation for prey reef fish. Differences in spatial distribution of resources for predators (i.e., prey fish) between continuous and patch reef habitats may explain the difference between these results and those of previous studies on patch reefs.

AB Measurements of photosynthesis at saturating irradiance and CO2 partial pressure, A(max), "adjusted" normalised difference vegetation index, R-aNDVI, and photochemical reflectance index, R-PRI, were made on trees sampled along a soil chronosequence to investigate the relationship between carbon uptake and ecosystem development in relation to nutrient availability. Measurements were made on the three most dominant species at six sites along the sequence in South Westland, New Zealand with soil age ranging from <6 to 120,000 years resulting from the retreat of the Franz Josef glacier. The decrease in soil phosphorus availability with increasing soil age and high soil nitrogen availability at the two youngest sites, due to the presence of a nitrogen-fixing species, provided marked differences in nutrient availability. Mean A(max) was high at the two youngest sites, then decreased markedly with increasing site age. Analysis of the data for individual species within sites revealed separation of groups of species in the response of A(max) to N-m and P-m, suggesting complex interactions between the two nutrients. There were strong linear relationships for leaf-level R-aNDVI and R-PRI with A(max), at high irradiance, showing that measurements of reflectance indices can be used to estimate A(max) for foliage with a range in morphology and nutrient concentrations. Notwithstanding the change in species composition from angiosperms to conifers with increasing site age, the presence of nitrogen-fixing species, the variability in foliage morphology from flat leaves to imbricate scales and a wide range in foliar nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations, there were strong positive linear relationships between site average A(max) and foliage nitrogen, N-m, and phosphorus, P-m, concentrations on a foliage mass basis. The results provide insights to interpret the regulation of photosynthesis across natural ecosystems with marked gradients in nitrogen and phosphorus availability.

AB Effects of elevated concentrations of carbon dioxide ([CO2]) and ozone ([03]) on photosynthesis and related biochemistry of two European silver birch (Betula pendula Roth) clones were studied under field conditions during 1999-2001. Seven-year-old trees of Clones 4 and 80 were exposed for 3 years to the following treatments in an open-top chamber experiment: outside control (OC), chamber control (CC), 2x ambient [CO2](EC), 2x ambient [O-3] (EO) and 2x ambient [CO2] + 2x ambient [O-3] (EC+EO). During the experiment, gas exchange, chlorophyll fluorescence, amount and activity of Rubisco, concentrations of chlorophyll, soluble protein, soluble sugars, starch, nitrogen (N) and carbon: nitrogen (C:N) ratio were determined in short- and long-shoot leaves. Elevated [CO2] increased photosynthetic rate by around 30% when measurements were made at the growth [CO2]. When measured at ambient [CO2], photosynthesis was around 15% lower in EC trees than in CC trees. This was related to a similar to 10% decrease in total leaf N, to 26 and 20% decreases in the amount and activity of Rubisco, respectively, and to a 49% increase in starch concentration in elevated [CO2]. Elevated [03] had no significant effect on gas exchange parameters and its effect on biochemistry was small in both clones. However, elevated [03] decreased the proportion of Rubisco in total soluble proteins and the apparent quantum yield of photosystem II (PSII) photochemistry in light and increased non-photochemical quenching in 2000. The interactive effect of CO2 and 03 was variable. Elevated [03] decreased chlorophyll concentration only in EO trees, and the EC+EO treatment decreased the total activity of Rubisco and increased the C:N ratio more than the EO treatment alone. The small effect of elevated [03] on photosynthesis indicates that these young silver birches were fairly tolerant to annual [O-3] exposures that were 2-3 times higher than the AOT40 value of 10 ppm.h. set as a critical dose for forest trees.

AB Molecular phylogenetics and its applications are popular and useful tools for making comparative investigations in genetics: however, estimating phylogenetic trees is not always straightforward. Some phylogenetic estimators use an explicit model of nucleotide evolution to estimate evolutionary parameters such as branch lengths and tree topology. There are many models to choose from, and use of the optimal model for a particular data set is important to avoid a loss of power and accuracy in phylogenetic estimations. Here, we review some molecular evolutionary forces and the parameters included in some common models of evolution used to interpret resulting patterns of molecular variation. We present some statistical methods of selecting a particular model of nucleotide evolution, and provide an empirical example of model selection. Statistical model selection strikes a balance between the bias introduced by some models and the increased variance of parameter estimates that results from using other models. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Conservation biologists rely heavily on taxonomy to set the scope for biological monitoring and recovery planning of rare or threatened species. Yet, taxonomic boundaries are seldom evaluated as falsifiable hypotheses that can be statistically tested. Here, we examine species boundaries in leatherside chub (Teleostei, Cyprinidae), an imperiled desert fish native to the Bonneville Basin and upper Snake River drainages of western North America. Recent molecular data hint that this fish could be composed of two distinct taxa that are geographically separated into northern and southern species. To formally test this hypothesis, we evaluated leatherside chub using several different categories of species concepts, including criteria dependent on phylogenetic, morphological, and ecological data. We found that leatherside chub is composed of two reciprocally monophyletic clades (candidate species) characterized by numerous fixed genetic differences for both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA markers; mtDNA sequence divergence between the two clades approached 8%. The candidate species also showed significant differences in cranial shape, revealed by morphometric analysis. Finally, controlled growth and foraging experiments using representative populations from each clade show that candidate species appear to be locally adapted to the thermal environments where they now occur. Combined, these three lines of evidence support the hypothesis that leatherside chub is composed of two species. Moreover, all lines of evidence place these two species within the genus Lepidomeda, a group consisting of three additional species of endangered spinedace fishes, and one extinct species, all native to the Colorado River system. Hence, we elevate the two clades of leatherside chub to distinct species status (Lepidomeda copei in the north and L. aliciae in the south), and argue that each warrants independent conservation and recovery action.

AB The hamadryas baboon (Papio hamadryas hamadryas) is found both in East Africa and western Arabia and is the only free-ranging nonhuman primate in Arabia. It has been hypothesized that hamadryas baboons colonized Arabia in the recent past and were possibly even transported there by humans. We investigated the phylogeography of hamadryas baboons by sequencing a portion of the control region of mtDNA in 107 baboons from four Saudi Arabian populations and combing these data with published data from Eritrean (African) P. h. hamadryas. Analysis grouped sequences into three distinct clades, with clade 1 found only in Arabia, clade 3 found only in Africa, but clade 2 found in both Arabian and African P. h. hamadryas and also in the olive baboon, P. h. anubis. Patterns of variation within Arabia are neither compatible with the recent colonization of Arabia, implying that baboons were not transported there by humans, nor with a northerly route of colonization of Arabia. We propose that hamadryas baboons reached Arabia via land bridges that have formed periodically during glacial maxima at the straits of Bab el Mandab in the southern Red Sea. We suggest that the genetic differentiation of Arabian from African populations suggests that Arabian populations have a higher conservation status than recognized previously.

AB The East Indies triangle, bordered by the Phillipines, Malay Peninsula and New Guinea, has a high level of tropical marine species biodiversity. Pristipomoides multidens is a large, long-lived, fecund snapper species that is distributed throughout the East Indies and Indo-Pacific. Samples were analysed from central and eastern Indonesia and northern Australia to test for genetic discontinuities in population structure. Fish (n=377) were collected from the Indonesian islands of Bali, Sumbawa, Flores, West Timor, Tanimbar and Tual along with 131 fish from two northern Australian locations (Arafura and Timor Seas) from a previous study. Genetic variation in the control region of the mitochondrial genome was assayed using restriction fragment length polymorphism and direct sequencing. Haplotype diversity was high (0.67-0.82), as was intraspecific sequence divergence (range 0-5.8%). F-ST between pairs of populations ranged from 0 to 0.2753. Genetic subdivision was apparent on a small spatial scale; F-ST was 0.16 over 191 km (Bali/Sumbawa) and 0.17 over 491 km (Bali/Flores). Constraints to dispersal that contribute to, and maintain, the observed degree of genetic subdivision are experienced presumably by all life history stages of this tropical marine finfish. The constraints may include (1) little or no movement of eggs or larvae, (2) little or no home range or migratory movement of adults and (3) loss of larval cohorts due to transport of larvae away from suitable habitat by prevailing currents.

AB The general hypothesis that catchment urbanization explained the distribution of the threatened, stream-dwelling amphipod Austrogammarus australis (listed under the Victorian Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act 1988) was tested using several surveys of 58 sites in streams draining the Dandenong Ranges on the eastern fringe of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. More specifically, four catchment-scale elements of urban land, hypothesized as sources of stress to receiving streams, were separated: catchment imperviousness, drainage connection (proportion of impervious areas connected to streams by stormwater pipes), density of unsealed roads and density of septic tanks. The degree to which each attribute independently and jointly explained the occurrence of A. australis was assessed using hierarchical partitioning of logistic regression analyses. Drainage connection independently best explained the occurrence of A. australis, pointing to stormwater drainage design as the priority area of catchment management for the conservation of the species. The separation of urban land use into attributes that characterize likely stressor sources provides a useful framework for assessing and prioritizing the most appropriate management actions to minimize urban-related stresses to aquatic biota.

AB The endemic Hawaiian grouper, Epinephelus quernus, is a commercially important species experiencing intense fishing pressure in part of its distributional range. We examined population genetic structure with 398 base pairs of the mitochondrial control region across a large portion of the range of E. quernus, spanning approximately 2000 km of the Hawaiian archipelago. Examination of genetic diversity shows that Gardner Island, situated midway along the island chain, harbours the most diverse haplotypes. F-statistics and Bayesian estimates of migration also reveal the mid-archipelago as genetically differentiated, where the first significant break among adjacent pairs of populations lies between the islands of Nihoa and Necker. Most island comparisons beyond Necker and Gardner to the northwest and among the lower five islands to the south-east show little to no genetic differences. Evidence of historical population expansion across the islands was also found by Maximum Likelihood analyses. The results suggest that management should be structured to reflect the genetic differentiation and diversity in the mid-archipelago, the patterns of which may be associated with oceanic current patterns.

AB Because randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) is the only type of molecular marker that has been used extensively in blueberry (Vaccinium spp.) for mapping and DNA fingerprinting of cultivars, there is a need to develop a new, robust marker system. Expressed sequence tags (ESTs) produced from a cDNA library, derived from RNA from floral buds of cold acclimated plants, were used to develop EST-PCR markers for blueberry. Thirty clones, picked at random from the cDNA library, were single-pass sequenced from the 5' and 3' ends. Thirty PCR primer pairs were designed from the ends of the best quality sequences that were generated and were tested in amplification reactions with genomic DNA from 19 blueberry genotypes, including two wild selections (the original parents of a mapping population), and 17 cultivars. Fifteen of the 30 primer pairs resulted in amplification of polymorphic fragments that were detectable directly after ethidium bromide staining of agarose gels. Several of the monomorphic amplification products were digested with the restriction enzyme AluI and approximately half resulted in polymorphic-sized fragments (cleaved amplified polymorphic sequences or CAPS markers). The polymorphic EST-PCR and CAPS markers developed in this study distinguished all the genotypes indicating that these markers should have general utility for DNA fingerprinting and examination of genetic relationships in blueberry. Similarity values were calculated based on the molecular marker data, and a dendrogram was constructed based on the similarity matrix. Coefficients of coancestry were calculated for each pair of genotypes from complete pedigree information. A fair correlation between similarity coefficients calculated from marker data and coefficients of coancestry was found.

AB Tomato rooting patterns were evaluated in a 2-year field trial where surface drip irrigation (R0) was compared with subsurface drip irrigation at 20 cm ( RI) and 40 cm (RII) depths. Pot-transplanted plants of two processing tomato, 'Brigade' (C1) and 'H3044' (C2), were used. The behaviour of the root system in response to different irrigation treatments was evaluated through minirhizotrons installed between two plants, in proximity of the plant row. Root length intensity (L-a), length of root per unit of minirhizotron surface area (cm cm(-2)) was measured at blooming stage and at harvest. For all sampling dates the depth of the drip irrigation tube, the cultivar and the interaction between treatments did not significantly influence L-a. However differences between irrigation treatments were observed as root distribution along the soil profile and a large concentration of roots at the depth of the irrigation tubes was found. For both surface and subsurface drip irrigation and for both cultivars most of the root system was concentrated in the top 40 cm of the soil profile, where root length density ranged between 0.5 and 1.5 cm cm(-3). Commercial yields (t ha(-1)) were 87.6 and 114.2 (R0), 107.5 and 128.1 (RI), 105.0 and 124.8 (RII), for 1997 and 1998, respectively. Differences between the 2 years may be attributed to different climatic conditions. In the second year, although no significant differences were found among treatments, slightly higher values were observed with irrigation tubes at 20 cm depth. Fruit quality was not significantly affected by treatments or by the interaction between irrigation tube depth and cultivar.

AB The impact of elevated pCO(2) on N-metabolism of hydroponically grown wild-type and transformed tobacco plants lacking root nitrate reduction was studied in order to elucidate the effects on (i) nitrate uptake, (ii) long-distance transport of N, (iii) nitrate reduction with emphasis on root-NR, and (iv) the allocation of N between the root and shoot. The findings were related to alterations of growth rates. At elevated pCO(2) the wild type exhibited higher growth rates, which were accompanied by an increase of NO3--uptake per plant, due to a higher root:shoot ratio. Furthermore, elevated pCO(2) enhanced nitrate reduction in the roots of the wild type, resulting in enhanced xylem-loading of organic N (amino-N) to supply the shoot with sufficient nitrogen, and decreased phloem-transport of organic N in a basipetal direction. Transformed tobacco plants lacking root nitrate reduction were smaller than the wild type and exhibited lower growth rates. Nitrate uptake per plant was decreased in transformed plants as a consequence of an impeded root growth and, thus, a significantly decreased root:shoot ratio. Surprisingly, transformed plants showed an altered allocation of amino-N between the root and the shoot, with an increase of amino-N in the root and a substantial decrease of amino-N in the shoot. In transformed plants, xylem-loading of nitrate was increased and the roots were supplied with organic N via phloem transport. Elevated pCO(2) increased shoot-NR, but only slightly affected the growth rates of transformed plants, whereas carbohydrates accumulated at elevated pCO(2) as indicated by a significant increase of the C/N ratio in the leaves of transformed plants. Unexpectedly, the C/N balance and the functional equilibrium between root and shoot growth was disturbed dramatically by the loss of nitrate reduction in the root.

AB As a potential mechanism to explain how biodiversity loss may influence variability in ecosystem functioning, we examine the hypothesis that biodiversity, loss lowers similarity in species composition, among local communities, and that this decreased similarity in turn lowers ecosystem reliability. Ecosystem reliability. refers. to the probability that a system: will provide a consistent level of performance over a given unit of time. This hypothesis is compared with other hypotheses that make similar predictions, including the sampling effect, insurance, and resource use complementarity hypotheses. We provide evidence for the similarity hypothesis through a reanalysis of a recent experiment and show that a key assumption of the hypothesis may be robust through computer simulations. We also address problems and possible solutions. regarding how to separately test the similarity and other hypotheses, in biodiversity experiments.

AB The common occurrence of polyandry continues to puzzle evolutionary biologists, as female reproductive success is thought to be limited mostly by her fecundity. Here we test whether females of the bulb mite, a species in which the females are highly promiscuous, benefit from polyandry in terms of increased fitness of their progeny. Females were given opportunity to mate with either one or six males, but the experiment was designed to allow the same number of matings per female in both groups, that is, irrespective of the number of males. We found that daughters of females mated to six males had significantly higher fecundity than daughters of females mated to one male, whereas other fitness components of progeny (male virility and longevity of both sexes) were not affected. These findings appear to support hypotheses proposing that multi-male mating enables females to exercise postcopulatory mate-choice (direct or indirect, via sperm competition) and thus accrue genetic benefits.

AB 1, Every plant will die if light, water or nutrients are withheld for long enough. It is natural to think of plants in general as having evolved a strong drive for resource acquisition as a survival mechanism. All else being equal, an individual that sequesters more material from the environment than its neighbour must be at a competitive advantage.
   2, But the resource capture imperative seems at odds with the profligacy of some characteristic developmental and metabolic processes in many plants. Here, using Leaf senescence as a vantage point, we consider whether a kind of wilful inefficiency of resource use may not be essential for success as a terrestrial autotroph.

AB We compared the density and spatial distribution of four small mammal species (Microtus ochrogaster, Peromyscus maniculatus, Sigmodon hispidus, and P. leucopus) along with general measures of an old field plant community across two successional phases (1984-1986 and 1994-1996) of an experimental study of fragmentation in eastern Kansas. During the early phase the plant community was characterized by little spatial or temporal variance across patch size, consistent with spatially neutral models of succession. In contrast? there was a strong, species-specific effect of patch size on small mammal species distribution and abundance. The lack of variance in vegetation structure across patch size during the early seres suggests that small mammal distributions were responding in large part to features of the system other than variance in vegetation structure and composition across patch size.
   As succession proceeded, the colonization of the system by woody plant species precipitated a series of patch size effects on plant community composition. Differential habitat selection by small mammals at the patch scale tracked these changes in plant distribution. For example, M. ochrogaster and S. hispidus shifted their distributions away from less fragmented patches toward smaller patches, where retarded plant succession had maintained an earlier sere. P. leucopus successfully colonized and maintained high densities only on large patches, where plant succession had progressed most rapidly toward a woody-species-dominated community.
   Our results highlight the role of landscape structure in long-term community dynamics and indicate that some of the complexity observed in successional systems may result from the structure and composition of the landscape mosaic. In general, our results suggest that to fully understand long-term change within communities, influence of landscape structure on patterns of heterogeneity in both vegetation and consumer dynamics must be understood. Moreover, the long-term and landscape-scale perspectives afforded by our study provide insight into community dynamics that might otherwise be missed.

SO MOLECULAR MICROBIOLOGY

DT Editorial Material
ID ARCHAEAL
AB In contrast to the universality of other central genetic mechanisms, the replication machinery of Bacteria is clearly different from those of Archaea and Eukaryotes. A large number of bacterial genes involved in DNA replication can also be found in plasmids and phages. Based on this, it has been recently proposed that the ancestral bacterial genes were displaced by non-orthologous replication genes from plasmids and phages, which would explain the profound difference between Bacteria and the other domains of life. The alternative hypothesis is that these DNA replication genes have been frequently transferred from bacterial hosts to the genomes of their plasmids and phages. The phylogenetic analysis of the bacterial DNA replication proteins most abundant in databases (replicative helicase DnaB, single-strand binding protein Ssb and topoisomerase TopB) presented here supports the latter hypothesis. Each protein tree shows that sequences from plasmids and phages branch close to their bacterial-specific hosts, suggesting multiple independent horizontal transfers. Therefore, there is no evidence so far for non-orthologous gene displacement of these genes.

AB The effects of small population size on genetic diversity and subsequent population recovery are theoretically predicted, but few empirical data are available to describe those relations. We use data from four remnant and three translocated sea otter (Enhydra lutris) populations to examine relations among magnitude and duration of minimum population size, population growth rates, and genetic variation. Mitochondrial (mt)DNA haplotype diversity was correlated with the number of years at minimum population size (r(s) = -0.741, p = 0.038) and minimum population size, (r(s) = 0.709, p = 0.054). We found no relation between population growth and haplotype diversity, although growth was significantly greater in translocated than in remnant populations. Haplotype diversity in populations established from two sources was higher than in a population established from a single source and was higher than in the respective source populations. Haplotype frequencies in translocated populations of foundling sizes of 4 and 28 differed from expected, indicating genetic drift and differential reproduction between source populations, whereas haplotype frequencies in a translocated population with a founding size of 150 did not. Relations between population demographics and genetic characteristics suggest that genetic sampling of source and translocated populations can provide valuable inferences about translocations.

AB Net primary production (NPP) and growth efficiency (wood growth per leaf area) decline with stand age for forest ecosystems. Three hypotheses have been suggested: high respiration to photosynthesis ratios, hydraulic limitations on water transport in trees, and nutrient limitations of photosynthesis. Recent work indicates that hydraulic or nutrient limitations probably are the mechanism underlying the decline of growth efficiency in Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) and lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta), both of which are native to western North America. However, balsam fir (Abies balsamea) grows in the cool-humid boreal forest and has very high stem respiration rates, suggesting that the mechanism may be different. We predicted measured aboveground NPP of 24 out of 25 balsam fir stands reasonably well. These stands were selected for having large differences in leaf area index and wood mass. Simulations indicate that increased wood respiration is the major factor causing the decline of NPP and growth efficiency with stand age; a secondary factor for mature stands is nitrogen limitation. For simulations in which balsam fir was fertilized, final growth efficiency was less than that of unfertilized forest stands because of increased stem respiration. From values in the literature, we calculated the potential difference conductance to water flow in the xylem from the soil to the leaves for a mean tree in each stand. Twigs had the smallest conductance; however, because the twigs conductances are added in parallel, the bole was the smallest conductance in the series: bole, branch and twigs. The overall drop of water potential with very high transpiration flux densities was generally less than 2.5 MPa. Therefore, we conclude that, for balsam fir, the decline in NPP and growth efficiency with stand age may be caused by the high respiration to photosynthesis ratios. This conclusion differs from recent work, so there is not a single unifying mechanism of age-related decline for all forest ecosystems. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In the tropical canopy tree, Dryobalanops aromatica Gaertn. f., upper-canopy leaves (UL) develop under sunlit conditions but are subjected to self-shading within the crown as they age. In contrast, lower-canopy leaves (LL) are exposed to uniform dim light conditions throughout their life span. By comparing leaf morphology and physiology of UL and LL, variations in leaf characteristics were related to leaf age and self-shading, Mass-based chlorophyll (chl) concentration and the chlorophyll/nitrogen (chl/N) ratio were lower and the chi a/b ratio was higher in UL than in LL, In UL, the chl/N ratio gradually increased and the chi a/b ratio gradually decreased with leaf aging, whereas these ratios remained unchanged with leaf age in LL. The effective quantum yield of photosystem II (PSII) (Delta F/F-m') at a given irradiance remained unchanged with leaf age in LL, whereas Delta F/F-m' changed with leaf age in UL. These data indicate N reallocation within the leaves from carbon fixation components to light harvesting components and a dynamic regulation of photochemical processes of PSII in response to increased self-shading of UL. Despite the difference in light environment with leaf age between UL and LL, maximum photosynthetic rates and nitrogen-use efficiency decreased with leaf aging in both UL and LL. Constancy in the chl/N ratio with leaf age in LL indicated that the decrease in photosynthetic capacity was caused by effects other than shading, such as leaf aging. We conclude that N reallocation and acclimation of PSII to self-shading occurred even in mature leaves, whereas the change in photosynthetic capacity with leaf age was more conservative.

AB Beluga whales (Delphinapterus leucas) in North American waters migrate seasonally between wintering areas in broken pack ice and summering locations in estuaries and other open water areas in the Arctic and sub-Arctic. Results from our previous investigation of beluga whale mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) revealed genetic heterogeneity among beluga from different summering locations that was interpreted as representing a high degree of summering site philopatry. However, mtDNA is maternally inherited and does not reflect mating that may occur among beluga from different summering locations in wintering areas or during annual migrations. To test the possibility that breeding occurs among beluga from different summering locations, genetic variability at five nuclear DNA (nDNA) microsatellite loci was examined in the same animals tested in the mtDNA study. Beluga samples (n = 640) were collected between 1984 and 1994 from 24 sites across North America, mostly during the summer. Whales from the various sites were categorized into eight summering locations as identified by mtDNA analysis, as well as four hypothesized wintering areas: Bering Sea, Hudson Strait (Hudson Strait, Labrador Sea, southwest Davis Strait), Baffin Bay (North Water, east Davis Strait), and St Lawrence River. Microsatellite allele frequencies indicated genetic homogeneity among animals from summering sites believed to winter together but differentiation among whales from some of the wintering areas. In particular, beluga from western North America (Bering Sea) were clearly distinguished from beluga from eastern North America (Hudson Strait, Baffin Bay, and St Lawrence River). Based upon the combined data set, the population of North American beluga whales was divided into two evolutionarily significant units. However, the population may be further subdivided into management units to reflect distinct groups of beluga at summering locations.

AB Studies of open populations, in which offspring are dispersed away from their natal site, often emphasise density-independent processes, namely stochastic variation in the input of newly arrived young (recruitment). Studies of closed populations, in which offspring remain close to their natal site, emphasise the role of density-dependence, particularly through competition and predation. The usefulness of this dichotomy was tested on spiny chromis Acanthochromis polyacanthus, which is one of the few marine fish that lack a pelagic larval phase and is thought to be the archetypal species for closed population status among reef-fishes. Experimental manipulations showed that juvenile A. polyacanthus suffered lower rates of mortality in locations where large predatory fish were excluded. The magnitude of differences in mortality between treatments (cages and open plots) matched natural differences in mortality between locations representing low and high numbers of predators, suggesting that large predatory fish were a primary source of juvenile mortality. Growth did not increase when prey and predator abundances were reduced. This finding rejected 2 models: that growth was reduced in large schools and these slower growing individuals suffered greater rates of predation; and that intraspecific competition occurred. Growth of prey increased when released from predation pressure, a process not previously considered in studies of growth in reef-fish. The repression of growth in response to predation pressure indicates that predators may have a more far-reaching effect on demography of reef-fish than previously thought. Predation was density-dependent in that juveniles in larger schools suffered greater rates of mortality in the presence of predators but not in their absence. Predation appeared to limit the upper size of schools, but this did not eliminate a linear relationship between input and subsequent abundance. Hence, density-dependent predation was weak and large fluctuations in recruitment (births) persisted and contributed importantly to fluctuation in prey density. These results support the model that when density-dependent mortality is weak, both input and subsequent mortality will be important limiting factors. Consequently, this study questions the assumption that variation in predation and competition has greater consequences for closed populations.

AB The Greater Bilby has shown a rapid decline in range during this century and now occupies only a small isolated area in south-western Queensland (QLD) and a larger but mostly low-density area in the north-western deserts of the Northern Territory (NT) and Western Australia (WA). We have examined variation in the control region of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and. at nine microsatellite loci in order to investigate the extent of current and historical subdivision across the species range, and to provide a preliminary assessment of genetic structuring and mating system on a finer scale within the QLD population. Both mtDNA and microsatellite loci had substantial variation within and among populations, with mtDNA divergence being greater between QLD and NT than between NT and WA. The QLD population had two unique and divergent mtDNA lineages, but there was no evidence for strong phylogeographical structure across the range. The available evidence suggests that the bilby should be considered as a single Evolutionarily Significant Unit consisting of multiple Management Units. Augmentation of the remnant QLD population from the NT does not appear necessary at this stage, at least not on genetic grounds. Finer-scale analysis of microsatellite variation for two QLD colonies revealed a deficiency of heterozygotes and significantly greater relatedness within than between colonies. However, structuring was observed only for males; relatedness values for females did not depart from those expected under panmixia. Parentage exclusion analysis for one colony allowed the construction of a partial pedigree which indicated strong polygyny, with one male fathering all but one of the eight offspring assigned. The extent to which fine-scale genetic structuring and differences between sexes is due to sex-biased dispersal vs. effects of mating system remain to be determined.

AB Simple ecosystem models of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) interactions between plants and soil show that differences in N-use efficiency cause convergence of plant growth in ecosystems with a closed N cycle because rapid growth associated with high N-use efficiency results in litter with a high C:N ratio and a low N mineralization rate, whereas slow growth associated with low N-use efficiency leads to a low C:N ratio and a high N mineralization rate. This plant-induced negative feedback on production contrasts with the positive feedback that had previously been hypothesized. Our model explains the causes and results of several important ecological patterns. First, all ecosystems with a fixed N pool will show a small increase in C storage (especially in soils) in response to elevated CO2 despite constraints by litter-quality feedbacks to N mineralization rate. Second, the decreased N-use efficiency and plateauing of primary production in forest ecosystems with a high N supply reflect saturation of photosynthetic rate with high plant N pools. Finally, the addition of inorganic N to ecosystems induces a quick increase in productivity and N supply. However, these increases disappear if N additions are not sustained. These findings suggest that those global changes that alter N input to or output from ecosystems are likely to have larger long-term impact on biomass, productivity, and C storage of ecosystems with a tightly closed N cycle than would changes in plant N-use efficiency.

AB Tree root systems may improve soil fertility through carbon inputs, uptake of leachable nutrients and maintenance of soil biomass, but can at the same time reduce crop yields by competition for water and nutrients. Quantitative information about the positive and negative effects of tree roots and their changes in space and time are necessary for the optimization of agroforestry associations. An alley cropping experiment was layed out as a randomized complete block design on a Plinthic Lixisol/Ferralic Cambisol with Gliricidia sepium hedgerows at 5 m distance, including a sole cropping control. The development of root systems was monitored by sequential soil coring (eight samplings) during one year, with maize and groundnut as crops. Additional information is presented from a single sampling for rice during the foregoing year. Pronounced fluctuations of live root length density indicated an important variability in the nutrient and water uptake capacity of the vegetation. At low total root length density, the hedgerows affected the root development in the agroforestry plots directly by the presence of their root systems. At high root length density, they affected root development mainly by improving crop root growth and influencing the composition of the spontaneous vegetation. The root length density of the hedgerows was too low to compete with the clops for soil resources. The hedgerows tended to increase root length densities in the subsoil when few roots were present, thus possibly reducing the risk of nutrient leaching. However, the length density of the perennial root systems decreased during the cropping season, presumably as an effect of repeated pruning, and attained minimum values almost at the same time as the crops. Trees with denser root systems which are less frequently pruned may be more efficient in achieving closer nutrient cycles, though at the cost of higher root competition with crops.

AB Xylem-tapping mistletoes transpire large volumes of water (E) while conducting photosynthesis (A) at low rates, thus maintaining low instantaneous water-use efficiency (A/E). These gas-exchange characteristics have been interpreted as a means of facilitating assimilation of nitrogen dissolved at low concentration in host xylem water; however, low A/E also results in substantial heterotrophic carbon gain. In this study, host trees (Juniperus osteosperma) were fertilized and gas exchange of mistletoe (Phoradendron juniperinum) and host were monitored to determine whether mistletoe A/E would approach that of the host if mistletoes were supplied with abundant nitrogen. Fertilization significantly increased foliar N concentrations (N), net assimilation rates, and A/E in both mistletoe and host. However, at any given N concentration, mistletoes maintained lower A and lower A/E than their hosts. On the other hand, when instantaneous water-use efficiency and A/N were calculated to include heterotrophic assimilation of carbon dissolved in the xylem sap of the host, both water-use efficiency and A/N converged on host values. A simple model of Phoradendron carbon and nitrogen budgets was constructed to analyze the relative benefits of nitrogen- and carbon-parasitism. The model assumes constant E and includes feedbacks of tissue nitrogen concentration on photosynthesis. These results, combined with our earlier observation that net assimilation rates of mistletoes and their hosts are approximately matched (Marshall et al. 1994), support part of the nitrogen-parasitism hypothesis: that high rates of transpiration benefit the mistletoe primarily through nitrogen gain. However, the low ratio of A/E is interpreted not as a means of acquiring nitrogen, but as an inevitable consequence of an imbalance in C and N assimilation.

AB Canopy nutrition, leaf chlorophyll concentration, and leaf CO2 assimilation capacity (A(max)) were examined in sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.) trees exhibiting symptoms of crown dieback in four stands on acid soils (pH approximate to 4.0) in northern Vermont. Leaf CO2 assimilation capacity was measured on foliage from detached and rehydrated branches harvested from the upper portion of the canopy. Leaf calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg) concentrations were among the lowest reported for sugar maple in its natural range. Total leaf chlorophyll concentrations of canopy leaves were lowest on the sites exhibiting the lowest leaf nitrogen (N) and Ca, and CO2 assimilation capacity was correlated with chlorophyll concentration among canopy leaves from all sites. Strong linear relationships were observed between leaf CO2 assimilation capacity per unit leaf mass and leaf N (r(2) = 0.60) as well as leaf Ca (r(2) = 0.51) among the four sites. On the basis of the observed strong correlation between leaf Ca and leaf N (r(2) = 0.64) and the lack of clear enhancement of leaf CO2 assimilation capacity in trees fertilized with base cations (K, Ca, and Mg), it appears that leaf CO2 assimilation capacity and leaf Ca may not necessarily be functionally related. However, since low leaf CO2 assimilation capacity and photosynthetic N-use efficiency were common in unfertilized trees with low Ca (Ca < 0.6%), CO2 assimilation processes in sugar maple on acid soils may be limited by N and Ca X Mg interactions. The strongly acidic nature of the soils in these stands and the magnitude of acidic deposition in the region may precondition sugar maple trees on some sites to levels of cation deficiency that may be associated with low CO2 assimilation in the forest canopy.

AB A species-rich lizard community responded variably to a range of experimental fire regimes in a tropical savanna. Heteronotia binoei was the only lizard species that showed a short-term response to fire, decreasing in abundance directly after the early- and late-bums. H. binoei and Diporiphora bilineata were significantly more abundant in early-burn treatments. Carlia amax was more abundant in unburnt and early-burn treatments. C. munda was more abundant in unburnt and early-burn sites. Differences in the relative abundance of species between treatments is attributed to site differences in vegetation structure, and fire-induced changes to the structure of habitat. Early-burn sites were significantly richer in lizard species (P<0.05); however, overall lizard abundance, Shannon-Wiener diversity and Detrended Correspondence Analysis (DCA) 1 and DCA 2 scores were not significantly different, suggesting that habitat partitioning has a stronger influence than the direct effects of fire. Many lizards were associated with a direct gradient of moisture availability, including a seepage assemblage, with Carlia gracilis and Sphenomorphus darwiniensis correlated with increased moisture, a well-developed canopy and abundant leaf litter. An assemblage associated with the drier end of the gradient included Carlia triacantha, Ctenotus kurnbudj, Diporiphora magna and D. bilineata. The lizard composition of most quadrats was intermediate along the moisture gradient and was associated with typical eucalypt savanna communities. Lizard species that largely are restricted to the moist seepage zones may be particularly sensitive to late dry-season fires which alter this habitat type.

AB Diseases in free-ranging wildlife, other than those in species of economic importance or diseases of public health significance. have long been overlooked and thus are rarely monitored. Recent findings, however, demonstrate that disease agents must be considered as integral in shaping many aspects of wildlife behavior and ecology. Very few scientists are trained in or function specifically with the study of diseases of free-ranging wildlife, and funding for such projects is difficult to obtain. The application of new biotechnological tools will no doubt contribute considerably to the rapid advancement of this field. The consideration of disease in all stages of species conservation projects is especially important because of the possibilities of genetic depression of immunity and the introduction of diseases into wild of populations.

AB Massive specimens of Cliona viridis, collected off the coast of Blanes (North-Western Mediterranean Sea) in January 1987, were exposed to different light (natural day-night irradiance/constant darkness) and substrata (calcareous/siliceous) conditions to assess their influence on growth, survival and attachment rates. Sponges cultured under natural irradiance displayed higher growth rates with increasing temperature; those cultured in the dark did not respond to increased temperature, but adapted faster to laboratory conditions. Differences in growth rates between these two culture conditions are ascribed to the presence of a healthy symbiotical zooxanthellae population on individuals cultured under conditions of natural irradiance. Attachment rates of the cut sides of the sponges which were in direct contact with the substratum, also increased with increasing temperature, whilst sponge survival was not significantly dependent on temperature. The chemical nature of the substratum clearly affected survival rates, which were higher on calcified than on siliceous substrata.

AB The western spruce budworm, Choristoneura occidentalis Freeman, was used to test the hypothesis that insect herbivore performance is dependent on dietary nitrogen in a positively linear or convex manner. Artificial diets with seven levels of N were tested both with or without mineral supplements to determine if minerals had important effects on the budworm's response to N. A three-generation bioassay quantified survival rates for all life stages and pupal weights for insects reared on diets with 1.2-7.6% N dry mass. Data were used to estimate population growth over three generations by determining the number of F1, F2, and F3 offspring produced (i.e., fitness  The budworm's response to increased dietary N was neither positively linear nor convex. Larvae reared on diets with very high (3.9 and 7.6%) concentrations of N, compared with N levels in Douglas-fir, Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco, foliage, had good survival and reproduction, whereas larvae on diets with N levels near foliage quantities (1.2-3.0%) had verv poor performance, with the exception that performance was good on the mineral-limited 1.2% N diet. The addition of minerals to the diets had important effects on responses to N, implicating an interaction between N and minerals. Regression analysis of data on estimated population growth on the 14 diets tested indicated that the ratio of Zn to N was the best predictor of budworm fitness, not the actual N content of the diet. The response to Zn/N ratios was concave, implying proportions less-than-or-equal-to 0.00085 or greater-than-or-equal-to 0.00282 had positive effects on fitness, whereas ratios from 0.001 to 0.0025 had negative effects. It was hypothesized that host plant N determines the amount of food ingested, which in turn affects the amounts of other nutrients consumed. Thus, a proper balance of many different nutrients appears to be the most important factor in the nutritional ecology of insect herbivores.

AB Foliar functional traits are widely used to characterize leaf and canopy properties that drive ecosystem processes and to infer physiological processes in Earth system models. Imaging spectroscopy provides great potential to map foliar traits to characterize continuous functional variation and diversity, but few studies have demonstrated consistent methods for mapping multiple traits across biomes. With airborne imaging spectroscopy data and field data from 19 sites, we developed trait models using partial least squares regression, and mapped 26 foliar traits in seven NEON (National Ecological Observatory Network) ecoregions (domains) including temperate and subtropical forests and grasslands of eastern North America. Model validation accuracy varied among traits (normalized root mean squared error, 9.1-19.4%; coefficient of determination, 0.28-0.82), with phenolic concentration, leaf mass per area and equivalent water thickness performing best across domains. Across all trait maps, 90% of vegetated pixels had reasonable values for one trait, and 28-81% provided high confidence for multiple traits concurrently. Maps of 26 traits and their uncertainties for eastern US NEON sites are available for download, and are being expanded to the western United States and tundra/boreal zone. These data enable better understanding of trait variations and relationships over large areas, calibration of ecosystem models, and assessment of continental-scale functional diversity.

AB Identifying vertical and horizontal assemblage drivers of bacterial community is important for improving the efficacies of ecological evaluation and remediation for a huge contaminated river (e.g. black-odor urban river). However, little is known about the effect of stochastic vs. deterministic processes on the reliability of the identification processes. Here, a comprehensive analysis was performed to reveal vertical and horizontal assemblage drivers of bacterial community in a heavily polluted urban river (total area of 4.23 km(2) and total length of 9.3 km), considering the relative importance of stochastic and deterministic processes. Heterogeneous bacterial community assemblages were observed in both vertical and horizontal profiles and the differences in the bacterial community between depths were relatively significant at genus level. The higher values for the Simpson dissimilarity index (horizontal beta(SIM )= 0.59 +/- 0.02; vertical beta(SIM) = 0.48 +/- 0.03) compared to the nestedness-resultant dissimilarity index (horizontal beta(NES) = 0.05 +/- 0.02; vertical beta(NES )= 0.05 +/- 0.05) showed that species replacement explained both the vertical and horizontal beta-diversity patterns. Comparison of horizontal and vertical Sorensen dissimilarity indices further indicated that the biodiversity of vertical community deserved more attention due to the shorter geographical distance with similar beta-diversity patterns compared to horizontal assemblages. Various traditional analysis without consideration for phylogenetic turnover revealed that TN, TP, NH4+-N, DO, ORP, Conductivity and CODMn were all the related environmental factors that influenced bacterial community. However, after taking stochastic vs. deterministic processes into account, only NH4+-N and ORP were identified as the main driving forces of trends in the vertical and in the horizontal assembly of bacterial community in the polluted urban river, respectively. This study is helpful for improving ecological assessment methodology and remediation strategy for contaminated urban rivers. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Ecosystem services (ES) are benefits derived from ecosystems and have great significance in sustainable development. Rapid transformations of materials, energy and information flow in ecosystems are impacted by urbanization. Some pressures damage the balance of the ecosystem, such as transformations of land use and changes to industrial structure. Therefore, a clear understanding of the relationship between ES and urbanization provides new insight into urban sustainable development planning and decision-making. Although plentiful literature has focused on the topic, few studies assess the spatiotemporal interactions between ES and urbanization. Nanjing lies in the Yangtze River Delta Economic Zone, China and has been experiencing rapid urbanization. We use decoupling and spatial correlation analysis to discuss the spatiotemporal interaction among four ecosystem services and urbanization in Nanjing. The results show that there is mostly weak decoupling between ecosystem services and urbanization; the index of urbanization and ecosystem services exhibits spatial autocorrelation not only by themselves but also with each other; urbanization damages ecosystem services, especially in the food supply, which declined by 17%. These results indicate that we can predict changes to ecosystem services through urbanization, optimize space provisioning and human activities, enrich studies on ecosystem services and guide sustainable urban development.

AB Non-structural carbohydrates (NSC) play a central role in plant functioning as energy carriers and building blocks for primary and secondary metabolism. Many studies have investigated how environmental and anthropogenic changes, like increasingly frequent and severe drought episodes, elevated CO2 and atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition, influence NSC concentrations in individual trees. However, this wealth of data has not been analyzed yet to identify general trends using a common statistical framework. A thorough understanding of tree responses to global change is required for making realistic predictions of vegetation dynamics. Here we compiled data from 57 experimental studies on 71 tree species and conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate general responses of stored soluble sugars, starch and total NSC (soluble sugars+starch) concentrations in different tree organs (foliage, above-ground wood and roots) to drought, elevated CO2 and N deposition. We found that drought significantly decreased total NSC in roots (-17.3%), but not in foliage and above-ground woody tissues (bole, branch, stem and/or twig). Elevated CO2 significantly increased total NSC in foliage (+26.2%) and roots (+12.8%), but not in above-ground wood. By contrast, total NSC significantly decreased in roots (-17.9%), increased in above-ground wood (+6.1%), but was unaffected in foliage from N fertilization. In addition, the response of NSC to three global change drivers was strongly affected by tree taxonomic type, leaf habit, tree age and treatment intensity. Our results pave the way for a better understanding of general tree function responses to drought, elevated CO2 and N fertilization. The existing data also reveal that more long-term studies on mature trees that allow testing interactions between these factors are urgently needed to provide a basis for forecasting tree responses to environmental change at the global scale.

AB New computational methods and next-generation sequencing (NGS) approaches have enabled the use of thousands or hundreds of thousands of genetic markers to address previously intractable questions. The methods and massive marker sets present both new data analysis challenges and opportunities to visualize, understand, and apply population and conservation genomic data in novel ways. The large scale and complexity of NGS data also increases the expertise and effort required to thoroughly and thoughtfully analyze and interpret data. To aid in this endeavor, a recent workshop entitled Population Genomic Data Analysis, also known as ConGen 2017, was held at the University of Montana. The ConGen workshop brought 15 instructors together with knowledge in a wide range of topics including NGS data filtering, genome assembly, genomic monitoring of effective population size, migration modeling, detecting adaptive genomic variation, genomewide association analysis, inbreeding depression, and landscape genomics. Here, we summarize the major themes of the workshop and the important take-home points that were offered to students throughout. We emphasize increasing participation by women in population and conservation genomics as a vital step for the advancement of science. Some important themes that emerged during the workshop included the need for data visualization and its importance in finding problematic data, the effects of data filtering choices on downstream population genomic analyses, the increasing availability of whole-genome sequencing, and the new challenges it presents. Our goal here is to help motivate and educate a worldwide audience to improve population genomic data analysis and interpretation, and thereby advance the contribution of genomics to molecular ecology, evolutionary biology, and especially to the conservation of biodiversity.

AB Common approaches tomapping green infrastructure in urbanised landscapes invariably focus on measures of land use or land cover and associated functional or physical traits. However, such onedimensional perspectives do not accurately capture the character and complexity of the landscapes in which urban inhabitants live. The new approach presented in this paper demonstrates how open-source, high spatial and temporal resolution data with global coverage can be used tomeasure and represent the landscape qualities of urban environments. Through going beyond simple metrics of quantity, such as percentage green and blue cover, it is now possible to explore the extent to which landscape quality helps to unpick the mixed evidence presented in the literature on the benefits of urban nature to human well-being. Here we present a landscape approach, employing remote sensing, GIS and data reduction techniques to map urban green infrastructure elements in a large U.K. city region. Comparison with existing urban datasets demonstrates considerable improvement in terms of coverage and thematic detail. The characterisation of landscapes, using census tracts as spatial units, and subsequent exploration of associations with social-ecological attributes highlights the further detail that can be uncovered by the approach. For example, eight urban landscape types identified for the case study city exhibited associations with distinct socioeconomic conditions accountable not only to quantities but also qualities of green and blue space. The identification of individual landscape features through simultaneous measures of land use and land cover demonstrated unique and significant associations between the former and indicators of human health and ecological condition. The approach may therefore provide a promising basis for developing further insight into processes and characteristics that affect human health and well-being in urban areas, both in the United Kingdom and beyond.

AB Land-use change impacts biodiversity and ecosystem services, which are intrinsically related. There is a serious lack of knowledge concerning on how land-use change affects this relationship at landscape level, where the greatest impacts have been reported. A proper knowledge of that relationship would provide crucial information for planning conservation strategies. The forest landscape of southern Chile, which includes Valdivian Temperate Forest, has been designated as a hotspot for biodiversity conservation. However, this landscape has been transformed by land-use change.
   We evaluated the impact of land-use change on the spatial patterns of the diversity of native forest habitat and the influence of these impacts on the provision of the ecosystem services water supply, erosion control, and organic matter accumulation from 1986 to 2011.
   The evaluation, at the landscape level, was carried out using satellite images, landscape metrics, spatially explicit models and generalized linear models. Results: We found that the area loss of native forest habitat was 12%, the number patches of native forest habitat increased more than 150% and the Shannon diversity index decreased by 0.20. The largest decrease in the provision of services was recorded for erosion control (346%), and the smallest for water supply (11%).
   The loss of provision of the ecosystem services can be explained by the interaction between the area loss, increase in the number patches and diversity loss. We recommend that the conservation planning strategies should consider the current landscape configuration, complemented with land-use planning.

AB Dam construction alters flow regimes and can change the composition of aquatic communities. Using data from three Brazilian hydrographic basins, we tested the hypothesis that reservoir cascades act as environmental filters for fish traits. This dataset included information on different environmental variables and fish traits (diet, migration, fecundation, parental care, position in the water column, and body size), and we used multivariate analysis (partial RLQ) to quantify the relationships between environmental variables, species abundance and traits. We found that the abundance of migratory species declined towards downstream reservoirs, which tend to be smaller and less turbid with a shorter water residence time than upstream reservoirs. We also found evidence of an association between reservoir age and the domination of fish communities by small-sized species with parental care, external fecundation, and benthic habits. Our findings suggest that particular fish traits are selected for across reservoir cascades.

AB Forest ecosystems world-wide are being subjected to invasion by organisms representing all domains of life. Here we use a combined aboveground-belowground approach to provide a conceptual framework for assessing how forests respond to biological invasions. We first address mechanisms by which invasive plants and aboveground and belowground consumers impact on forests, and highlight that although we have a growing understanding of the determinants of the effects of invasive plants, for invasive consumers we have yet to move from a series of iconic case studies to the development of general principles. We also address the effects of invasive biota in the context of the drivers of invasion, co-invasion and invasional meltdown, the issue of simultaneous species gains and losses, and forest restoration and recovery post-invasion. We then highlight areas that would benefit from further work, particularly regarding underlying mechanisms, determinants of context-dependency of invader effects, and linkages between causes and consequences of invasion. In concluding, we emphasize that biological invaders have the potential for large-scale and long-term impacts on forest processes, and consideration of these impacts in an aboveground-belowground context will enable better prediction of future responses of forests to invaders and their management as well as of restoration efforts.

AB Kelp forests dominated by species of Laminariales are globally recognized as key habitats on subtidal temperate rocky reefs. Forests characterized by fucalean seaweed, in contrast, receive relatively less attention despite being abundant, ubiquitous, and ecologically important. Here, we review information on subtidal fucalean taxa of Australia's Great Southern Reef, with a focus on the three most abundant and widely distributed genera (Phyllospora, Scytothalia, and Sargassum) to reveal the functionally unique role of fucoids in temperate reef ecology. Fucalean species span the entire temperate coastline of Australia (similar to 71,000km(2)) and play an important role in supporting subtidal temperate biodiversity and economic values on rocky reefs as well as in adjacent habitats. Climatic and anthropogenic stressors have precipitated significant range retractions and declines in many fucoids, with critical implications for associated assemblages. Such losses are persistent and unlikely to be reversed naturally due to the life history of these species and colonization of competitors and grazers following loss. Active restoration is proving successful in bringing back some fucoid species (Phyllospora comosa) lost from urban shores and will complement other passive and active forms of conservation. Fucalean forests play a unique role on subtidal temperate reefs globally, especially in Australia, but are comparatively understudied. Addressing this knowledge gap will be critical for understanding, predicting, and mitigating extant and future loss of these underwater forests and the valuable ecosystem services they support.

AB Predicting restoration outcomes requires an understanding of the natural variability of ecosystem properties. A hierarchy of predictability has been proposed that ranks measures of restoration success from most-to-least predictable in the following order: vegetation structure > taxonomic diversity > functional diversity > taxonomic composition. This hierarchy has not been tested empirically, and the location within the hierarchy of trait-based measures, such as community-level trait means and variances, is not well understood.
   Our objective was to test the hierarchy of predictability in one of the longest running ecological restoration experiments in the western USA. We used linear mixed effects models to analyse changes in herbaceous biomass, species richness, two functional diversity (FD) indices, community-weighted mean (CWM) traits and taxonomic composition among experimental restoration treatments from 1992 to 2014 in a ponderosa pine-bunchgrass ecosystem. Restoration treatments included combinations of light or heavy tree thinning and no fire or repeated prescribed fire every 4years to release the herbaceous understorey from overstorey competition.
   Herbaceous biomass and species richness were the two most predictable and least variable measures of success, whereas taxonomic composition exhibited the highest variability among plots through time. Trait-based measures of FD tended to be more predictable and less variable than CWM trait values in this experiment. Both CWM trait values and FD were less variable among plots than taxonomic composition.
   Synthesis and applications. Ecosystem properties that are intrinsically more variable over space and time will often be the least predictable restoration outcomes. Restoration practitioners can expect vegetation structure, species richness and functional diversity to be more predictable and less variable than taxonomic composition, which can exhibit dynamic responses to restoration treatments over time. Monitoring dominant native and invasive species will always be important, but given the functional redundancy that can occur within communities, strict targets based on composition may rarely be met. Trait-based metrics that integrate taxonomic composition into their calculation are less variable and potentially more meaningful for evaluating ecosystem responses. The hierarchy of predictability should be tested in a range of ecosystems to determine its generality.

AB Forest soils are important components in the global C-cycle. Regional soil organic carbon (SOC) stock assessments are hampered by low spatial densities of routine soil inventories. In this study, we estimated the SOC stock in the upper meter of forest in the region of Flanders (N. Belgium) using four digital soil mapping techniques, i.e. multiple linear regression (MLR), boosted regression trees (BRT), artificial neural networks (ANN) and least-squares support vector machines (LS-SVM), and compared them with the results of a multi-level spatial generalisation (MLSG) approach.
   Applied to a collection of 276 soil profiles, we identified the highest groundwater level, clay fraction, tree genus and soil type as key predictors of the SOC stock in the upper 100 cm under forests. Overall, BRT was the most informative as it obtained the best fit (training R-2 of 0.68, cross-validated R-2 of 0.22) and provided insights in the soil system by showing average predictor effects in partial dependence plots. With BRT, the total stock in the upper meter of forest soil (153,544 ha) was estimated to be 26.99 Mt OC, or 17.58 kg m(-2) on average. MLSG provided an estimate for only 90% of the forest area and resulted in a larger average stock of 18.22 kg m(-2) due to larger predictions for Histosols. As a null model, i.e. assuming that the potential natural dominant tree genus would occur according to the present soil conditions, the SOC stock in the current forest area was estimated at 30.00 Mt OC, or 21.26 kg OC m(-2) on average. When the complete non-built-up territory (1,168,850 ha) would be forested analogously, 255.28 Mt OC would be stored, which is more than double the amount of predictions under the actual land cover. The results highlight the importance to conserve and restore carbon hotspots like alluvial forests. New soil inventories should focus on these and other data-scarce land units. Future modelling approaches can benefit from explicitly taking the soil type and tree genus into account as predictors. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Plant functional traits may be altered as plants adapt to various environmental constraints. Cold, low fertility growing conditions are often associated with root adjustments to increase acquisition of limiting nutrient resources, but they may also result in construction of roots with reduced uptake potential but higher tissue persistence. It is ultimately unclear whether plants produce fine roots of different structure in response to decreasing temperatures and whether these changes represent a trade-off between root function or potential root persistence. We assessed patterns of root construction based on various root morphological, biochemical and defense traits including root diameter, specific root length (SRL), root tissue density (RTD), C:N ratio, phenolic compounds, and number of phellem layers across up to 10 root orders in diverse populations of Scots pine along a 2000-km climatic gradient in Europe. Our results showed that different root traits are related to mean annual temperature (MAT) and expressed a pattern of higher root diameter and lower SRL and RTD in northern sites with lower MAT. Among absorptive roots, we observed a gradual decline in chemical defenses (phenolic compounds) with decreasing MAT. In contrast, decreasing MAT resulted in an increase of structural protection (number of phellem layers) in transport fine roots. This indicated that absorptive roots with high capacity for nutrient uptake, and transport roots with low uptake capacity, were characterized by distinct and contrasting trade-offs. Our observations suggest that diminishing structural and chemical investments into the more distal, absorptive roots in colder climates is consistent with building roots of higher absorptive capacity. At the same time, roots that play a more prominent role in transport of nutrients and water within the root system saw an increase in structural investment, which can increase persistence and reduce long-term costs associated with their frequent replacement.

AB Non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) is an important photoprotective mechanism in rice; however, little is known regarding its role in the photosynthetic response of rice plants with differing in leaf color to different irradiances. In this study, two rice genotypes containing different chlorophyll contents, namely Zhefu802 (high chlorophyll) and Chl-8 (low chlorophyll), were subjected to moderate or high levels of light intensity at the 6-leaf stage. Chl-8 possessed a lower chlorophyll content and higher chlorophyll a:b ratio compared with Zhefu802, while Pn, F-v/F-m, and Phi PSII contents were higher in Chl-8. Further results indicated that no significant differences were observed in the activities of Rubisco, Mg2+-ATPase, and Ca2+-ATPase between these genotypes. This suggested that no significant difference in the capacity for CO2 assimilation exists between Zhe802 and Chl-8. Additionally, no significant differences in stomatal limitation were observed between the genotypes. Interestingly, higher NPQ and energy quenching (qE), as well as lower photoinhibitory quenching (qI) and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was observed in Chl-8 compared with Zhefu802 under both moderate and high light treatments. This indicated that NPQ could improve photosynthesis in rice under both moderate and high light intensities, particularly the latter, whereby NPQ alleviates photodamage by reducing ROS production. Both zeaxanthin content and the expression of PsbS1 were associated with the induction of NPQ under moderate light, while only zeaxanthin was associated with NPQ induction under high light. In summary, NPQ could improve photosynthesis in rice under moderate light and alleviate photodamage under high light via a decrease in ROS generation.

ID PLANT FUNCTIONAL TYPES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; TRAITS; COMMUNITY; RESPONSES
AB Despite advances in plant functional ecology that provide a framework for predicting the responses of vegetation to environmental change(1-3), links between plant functional strategies and elevated temperatures are poorly understood(3-5). Here, we analyse the response of a species-rich grassland in northern England to two decades of temperature and rainfall manipulations in the context of the functional attributes of 21 coexisting species that represent a large array of resource-use strategies. Three principal traits, including body size (canopy height), tissue investment (leaf construction cost), and seed size, varied independently across species and reflect tradeoffs associated with competitiveness, stress tolerance, and colonization ability. Unlike past studies(5-7), our results reveal a strong association between functional traits and temperature regime; species favoured by extended growing seasons have taller canopies and faster assimilation rates, which has come at the expense of those species of high tissue investment. This trait-warming association was three times higher in deep soils, suggesting species shifts have been strongly mediated by competition(8). In contrast, vegetation shifts from rainfall manipulations have been associated only with tissue investment. Functional shifts towards faster growing species in response to warming may be responsible for a marginal increase in productivity in a system that was assumed to be nutrient-limited(9).

AB The aquatic invertebrate seedbank' comprises life stages that remain viable in the bed sediments of temporary freshwaters during dry phases. This seedbank promotes persistence of temporary-stream macroinvertebrates, but how its inhabitants respond to extended dry phases or repeated transitions between wet and dry phases remains unknown. We rehydrated samples collected from the dry bed of a temperate-zone stream during a supra-seasonal drought, to examine the seedbank assemblage. Samples were first collected in autumn,from 12 sites along the ephemeral (4 sites), intermittent (2) and near-perennial (6) reaches, which had been dry for up to 8months. Our first hypothesis was that assemblage composition would be related to the dry-phase duration preceding sampling, with longer dry phases reducing abundance and richness. We revisited the same sites in three subsequent seasons, collecting and rehydrating sediments from all dry sites: five sites in early spring, three in late spring and four in late summer. Unpredictable flow resumption and redrying occurred between sampling dates. Our second hypothesis was that repeated wet-dry cycles would not degrade the assemblage because temporary-stream taxa would be adapted to fluctuating hydrological conditions. Multiple individuals of only Chironomidae, Oligochaeta and Pisidium were present at sites that experienced the longest dry phases, providing some support for our first hypothesis. An additional 21 taxa were recorded across the remaining (shorter dry phase) sites in autumn, indicating that such sites act as refuges and potential recolonist sources following flow resumptions. Although several insect orders first recorded in early spring were absent in later seasons, taxon-specific life cycles indicated that these absences were probably seasonal and not due to repeated wet-dry cycles. We recorded 38 taxa in total, highlighting the seedbank as a dry-phase resistance mechanism for many temporary-stream macroinvertebrates. Our results also suggest that seedbank diversity may be threatened by increases in drought extent and duration.

AB Cetacean watching from tour boats has increased in recent years and has been promoted as an ethically viable alternative to cetacean viewing in captive facilities or directed take. However, short- and long-term impacts of this industry on the behaviour and energetic expenditure of cetaceans have been documented. Although multiple studies have investigated the acoustic response of dolphins to marine tourism, there are several covariates that could also explain some of these results and should be considered simultaneously. Here, we investigated whether common bottlenose dolphins, Tursiops truncatus, inhabiting Walvis Bay, Namibia vary their whistle parameters in relation to boat presence, surface behaviour and/or group composition. We detected an upward shift of up to 1.99 kHz in several whistle frequency parameters when dolphins were in the presence of one or more tour boats and the research vessel. No changes were demonstrated in the frequency range, number of inflection points or duration of whistles. A similar, although less pronounced difference was observed in response to engine noise generated by the research vessel when idling, suggesting that noise alone plays an important role in driving this shift in whistle frequency. Additionally, a strong effect of surface behaviour was observed, with the greatest difference in whistle parameters detected between resting and other behavioural states that are associated with higher degrees of emotional arousal. Group composition also contributed to the variation observed, with the impact of boats dependent on whether calves were present or not. Overall these results demonstrate high natural variation in the frequency parameters of whistles utilized by dolphins over varying behavioural states and group composition. Anthropogenic impact in the form of marine tour boats can influence the vocalization parameters of dolphins and such changes could have a long-term impact if they reduce the communication range of whistles or increase energy expenditure.

AB Effective species conservation and management requires information on species distribution patterns, which is challenging for highly mobile and cryptic species that may be subject to multiple anthropogenic stressors across international boundaries. Understanding species-habitat relationships can improve the assessment of trends and distribution by explicitly allowing high-resolution data on habitats to inform abundance estimation and the identification of protected areas. In this study, we aggregated an unprecedented set of survey data of a marine top predator, the harbor porpoise (Phocoena phocoena), collected in the UK (SCANS II, Dogger Bank), Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, and Denmark, to develop seasonal habitat-based density models for the central and southern North Sea. Visual survey data were collected over 9 yr (2005-2013) by means of dedicated line-transect surveys, taking into account the proportion of missed sightings. Generalized additive models of porpoise density were fitted to 156,630 km of on-effort survey data with 14,356 sightings of porpoise groups. Selected predictors included static and dynamic variables, such as depth, distance to shore and to sandeel (Ammodytes spp.) grounds, sea surface temperature (SST), proxies for fronts, and day length. Day length and the spatial distribution of daily SST proved to be good proxies for "season," allowing predictions in both space and time. The density models captured seasonal distribution shifts of porpoises across international boundaries. By combining the large-scale international SCANS II survey with the more frequent, small-scale national surveys, it has been possible to provide seasonal maps that will be used to assist the EU Habitats and Marine Strategy Framework Directives in effectively assessing the conservation status of harbor porpoises. Moreover, our results can facilitate the identification of regions where human activities and disturbances are likely to impact the population and are especially relevant for marine spatial planning, which requires accurate fine-scale maps of species distribution to assess risks of increasing human activities at sea.

AB Functional trait analysis is an appealing approach to study differences among biological communities because traits determine species' responses to the environment and their impacts on ecosystem functioning. Despite a rapidly expanding quantitative literature, it remains challenging to conceptualize concurrent changes in multiple trait dimensions (trait space) and select quantitative functional diversity methods to test hypotheses prior to analysis. To address this need, we present a widely applicable framework for visualizing ecological phenomena in trait space to guide the selection, application, and interpretation of quantitative functional diversity methods. We describe five hypotheses that represent general patterns of responses to disturbance in functional community ecology and then apply a formal decision process to determine appropriate quantitative methods to test ecological hypotheses. As a part of this process, we devise a new statistical approach to test for functional turnover among communities. Our combination of hypotheses and metrics can be applied broadly to address ecological questions across a range of systems and study designs. We illustrate the framework with a case study of disturbance in freshwater communities. This hypothesis-driven approach will increase the rigor and transparency of applied functional trait studies.

AB Since the chromatographic fingerprint was introduced, it has been accepted by many countries to assess the quality and authenticity of Chinese herbal medicine (CHM). However, solely using the chromatographic fingerprint to assay numerous chemicals is not suitable for the assessment of the whole internal quality and pharmacodynamics of CHM. Consequently, it is necessary to develop a rational approach to connecting the chromatographic fingerprint with effective components to assess the internal quality of CHM. For this purpose, a spectrum-effect relationship theory was proposed and accepted as a new method for the assessment of CHM because of its potential use to screen effective components from CHM. In this paper, we systematically reviewed the application of the spectrum-effect relationship theory in the research of CHM, including research mentality, different chromatographic analysis techniques, data processing technologies, and structure determination.

AB The trade-off between predator avoidance and foraging is a key decision making factor that shapes an organism's adaptive behaviour and movement patterns. Human hunters act as top predators to influence the behaviour of free-ranging mammals, including large carnivorous species such as black bears (Ursus americanus). Analysing the effects of hunting on animal behavioural patterns is essential for understanding the extent to which animals detect and respond to human-induced disturbances. To this end, we assessed whether black bear movement behaviour changed with varying risk from spatially and temporally heterogeneous human predation. Levels of risk were categorized as either low (disturbance from dog training; n = 19 bears) or high (disturbance from hunting activities; n = 11 bears). Road types were either paved (risk due to vehicles) or non-paved (risk due to hunters) and were used as proxies for hunting effort and amount of disturbance. We began by testing the null hypothesis that bears' distribution before the onset of human disturbance is spatially random. Next, to test temporal movement adjustment between the low and high risk levels, we measured the distance to the nearest road and the road crossing frequency using mixed effects models with risk level, time of day and sex as predictor variables.
   As disturbance near non-paved roads increased due to the start of the hunting activity, the mean distances of bears to non-paved roads increased while the mean distances of bears to paved roads decreased, despite the continual risk of vehicle collision. These behavioural responses were observed during day and night, with the frequency of crossing paved roads at night five times greater than in daytime during the hunting season.
   Our findings demonstrate that black bears are able to detect risky places and adjust their spatial movements accordingly. More specifically, bears can perceive changes in the level of risk from human hunting activities on a fine temporal scale. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Soil stores more carbon (C) than plants and atmosphere combined and it is vulnerable to increased microbial respiration under projected global changes including land-use change and future climate scenarios (mainly elevated temperature). Land-use change is known to have a direct impact on soil organic C and soil respiration (Rs) but the mechanisms that drive these changes remain debatable. Similarly, recent studies and simulation models predict that Rs will respond positively to projected climate warming. However, there are significant uncertainties in the magnitude and mechanisms of this feedback response of Rs to global change. To identify the mechanisms of Rs response to land-use change and climate warming, we first investigated Rs from different land use types. Soil respiration was estimated seasonally from four different Scottish land uses: moorland, birch woodland, grassland and pine forest (n = 24). Our results demonstrated that despite a dramatic loss of total C and nitrogen (N) in the soils under birch trees, the Rs in the birch woodland was similar to that of the moorland and pine forest, with Rs in the grassland being significantly higher. The microbial community structure, estimated by Multiplex Terminal-Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (MT-RFLP) and 454 pyrosequencing, was significantly different under each land use type. A strong correlation of Rs with soil properties (pH, inorganic N, C:N ratio and moisture) and with microbial community structure was identified.
   To test the impact of elevated temperature on Rs and to identify potential microbial mechanisms, we performed laboratory incubation studies. Soils from different land uses were incubated at 7 degrees C (mean annual temperature (MAT) in Scotland) and 10 degrees C (MAT + 3 degrees C) with and without the presence of a labile (C-13-glucose) and recalcitrant (C-13-lignin) form of C to identify the active groups of microbes and to determine the role of substrate availability on feedback response. The warming treatment induced an increase in Rs rates in all soils. The magnitude of the Rs response to warming was modulated by the land use types, and the Rs was more prominent in soils with high C contents. The addition of glucose substantially increased both total and rate of Rs compared to no substrate- and lignin-amended soils, providing evidence of labile C depletion as a mechanism for the thermal response of Rs. The warming treatment did not impact the composition of the active or total microbial community as revealed by phospholipid fatty acid-stable isotope probing (PLFA-SIP), MT-RFLP and 454 pyrosequencing. Our results showed that the microbial metabolic activity was higher under warming treatment suggesting that a positive feedback of Rs to increased temperature is mediated by changes in substrate availability and microbial metabolic rates.

AB In recent years there has been significant interest in modelling cumulative effects and the population consequences of individual changes in cetacean behaviour and physiology due to disturbance. One potential source of disturbance that has garnered particular interest is whale-watching. Though perceived as 'green' or eco-friendly tourism, there is evidence that whale-watching can result in statistically significant and biologically meaningful changes in cetacean behaviour, raising the question whether whale-watching is in fact a long term sustainable activity. However, an assessment of the impacts of whale-watching on cetaceans requires an understanding of the potential behavioural and physiological effects, data to effectively address the question and suitable modelling techniques. Here, we review the current state of knowledge on the viability of long-term whale-watching, as well as logistical limitations and potential opportunities. We conclude that an integrated, coordinated approach will be needed to further understanding of the possible effects of whale-watching on cetaceans. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The concept of the designatable unit (DU) affords a practical approach to identifying diversity below the species level for conservation prioritization. However, its suitability for defining conservation units in ecologically diverse, geographically widespread and taxonomically challenging species complexes has not been broadly evaluated. The lake whitefish species complex (Coregonus spp.) is geographically widespread in the Northern Hemisphere, and it contains a great deal of variability in ecology and evolutionary legacy within and among populations, as well as a great deal of taxonomic ambiguity. Here, we employ a set of hierarchical criteria to identify DUs within the Canadian distribution of the lake whitefish species complex. We identified 36 DUs based on (i) reproductive isolation, (ii) phylogeographic groupings, (iii) local adaptation and (iv) biogeographic regions. The identification of DUs is required for clear discussion regarding the conservation prioritization of lake whitefish populations. We suggest conservation priorities among lake whitefish DUs based on biological consequences of extinction, risk of extinction and distinctiveness. Our results exemplify the need for extensive genetic and biogeographic analyses for any species with broad geographic distributions and the need for detailed evaluation of evolutionary history and adaptive ecological divergence when defining intraspecific conservation units.

AB Boreal peatlands store large amounts of carbon, reflecting their important role in the global carbon cycle. The short-term exchange and the long-term storage of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) in these ecosystems are closely associated with the permanently wet surface conditions and are susceptible to drought. Especially, the single most important peat forming plant genus, Sphagnum, depends heavily on surface wetness for its primary production. Changes in rainfall patterns are expected to affect surface wetness, but how this transient rewetting affects net ecosystem exchange of CO2 (NEE) remains unknown. This study explores how the timing and characteristics of rain events during photosynthetic active periods, that is daytime, affect peatland NEE and whether rain event associated changes in environmental conditions modify this response (e.g. water table, radiation, vapour pressure deficit, temperature). We analysed an 11-year time series of half-hourly eddy covariance and meteorological measurements from Degero Stormyr, a boreal peatland in northern Sweden. Our results show that daytime rain events systematically decreased the sink strength of peatlands for atmospheric CO2. The decrease was best explained by rain associated reduction in light, rather than by rain characteristics or drought length. An average daytime growing season rain event reduced net ecosystem CO2 uptake by 0.23-0.54gCm(-2). On an annual basis, this reduction of net CO2 uptake corresponds to 24% of the annual net CO2 uptake (NEE) of the study site, equivalent to a 4.4% reduction of gross primary production (GPP) during the growing season. We conclude that reduced light availability associated with rain events is more important in explaining the NEE response to rain events than rain characteristics and changes in water availability. This suggests that peatland CO2 uptake is highly sensitive to changes in cloud cover formation and to altered rainfall regimes, a process hitherto largely ignored.

AB 1. Plant functional traits have revealed trade-offs related to life-history adaptations, geographical distributions, and ecosystem processes. Fine roots are essential in plant resource acquisition and play an important role in soil carbon cycling. Nonetheless, root trait variation is still poorly quantified and rarely related to the rest of the plant.
   2. We examined chemical and morphological traits of 34 temperate arbuscular mycorrhizal tree species, representing three main angiosperm clades (super-orders asterid, magnoliid and rosid). We tested to what extent fine root chemical and morphological traits were correlated similarly to the leaf economical spectrum (LES) or were structured by ancestral affiliations among species.
   3. Root traits did not display the same trade-offs as leaves (e.g. specific root length was not correlated with root N, whereas specific leaf area was correlated with leaf N). Moreover, 75% of below-ground traits were phylogenetically structured according to Pagel's lambda and Abouheif's C-mean autocorrelation tests, as opposed to 28% of above-ground traits. Magnoliids showed thicker, less branched roots than asterids or rosids, but rosid roots exhibited lower N and higher non-acid-hydrolysable (e.g. lignin) content than other species. In contrast, leaf traits did not differ significantly among super-orders. At the whole-tree level, chemical traits such as nitrogen tissue content and lignin content were correlated between above and below-ground organs.
   4. The distribution of root traits in woody temperate trees was better explained by shared ancestry than by the nutrient content and structural trade-offs expected by the LES hypothesis. Root chemistry and morphology differed substantially among species belonging to different super-orders, suggesting deep divergences in resource acquisition strategies among major angiosperm groups. Although we found partial support for the idea of whole-plant integration based on corresponding nitrogen content across all organs (i.e. a plant economics spectrum), our study stresses phylogenetic affiliation as the primary driver of root trait distributions among angiosperms, a pattern that could be easily overlooked based solely on above-ground observations.

AB Short tandem repeats (STRs) are implicated in dozens of human genetic diseases and contribute significantly to genome variation and instability. Yet profiling STRs from short-read sequencing data is challenging because of their high sequencing error rates. Here, we developed STR-FM, short tandem repeat profiling using flank-based mapping, a computational pipeline that can detect the full spectrum of STR alleles from short-read data, can adapt to emerging read-mapping algorithms, and can be applied to heterogeneous genetic samples (e.g., tumors, viruses, and genomes of organelles). We used STR-FM to study STR error rates and patterns in publicly available human and in-house generated ultradeep plasmid sequencing data sets. We discovered that STRs sequenced with a PCR-free protocol have up to ninefold fewer errors than those sequenced with a PCR-containing protocol. We constructed an error correction model for genotyping STRs that can distinguish heterozygous alleles containing STRs with consecutive repeat numbers. Applying our model and pipeline to Illumina sequencing data with 100-bp reads, we could confidently genotype several disease-related long trinucleotide STRs. Utilizing this pipeline, for the first time we determined the genome-wide STR germline mutation rate from a deeply sequenced human pedigree. Additionally, we built a tool that recommends minimal sequencing depth for accurate STR genotyping, depending on repeat length and sequencing read length. The required read depth increases with STR length and is lower for a PCR-free protocol. This suite of tools addresses the pressing challenges surrounding STR genotyping, and thus is of wide interest to researchers investigating disease-related STRs and STR evolution.

AB The goal of captive breeding programmes is often to maintain genetic diversity until re-introductions can occur. However, due in part to changes that occur in captive populations, approximately one-third of re-introductions fail. We evaluated genetic changes in captive populations using microsatellites and mtDNA. We analysed six populations of white-footed mice that were propagated for 20 generations using two replicates of three protocols: random mating (RAN), minimizing mean kinship (MK) and selection for docility (DOC). We found that MK resulted in the slowest loss of microsatellite genetic diversity compared to RAN and DOC. However, the loss of mtDNA haplotypes was not consistent among replicate lines. We compared our empirical data to simulated data and found no evidence of selection. Our results suggest that although the effects of drift may not be fully mitigated, MK reduces the loss of alleles due to inbreeding more effectively than random mating or docility selection. Therefore, MK should be preferred for captive breeding. Furthermore, our simulations show that incorporating microsatellite data into the MK framework reduced the magnitude of drift, which may have applications in long-term or extremely genetically depauperate captive populations.

AB The Tasmanian devil (Sarcophilus harrisii) was widespread in Australia during the Late Pleistocene but is now endemic to the island of Tasmania. Low genetic diversity combined with the spread of devil facial tumour disease have raised concerns for the species' long-term survival. Here, we investigate the origin of low genetic diversity by inferring the species' demographic history using temporal sampling with summary statistics, full-likelihood and approximate Bayesian computation methods. Our results show extensive population declines across Tasmania correlating with environmental changes around the last glacial maximum and following unstable climate related to increased 'El Nino-Southern Oscillation' activity.

AB We test the validity of applying the alternative stable state paradigm to account for the landscape-scale forest/non-forest mosaic that prevails in temperate Tasmania, Australia. This test is based on fine-scale pollen, spore, and charcoal analyses of sediments located within a small patch of non-forest vegetation surrounded by temperate forest. Following nearly 500 years of forest dominance at the site, a catastrophic fire drove an irreversible shift from a forested Cyperaceae-Sphagnum wetland to a non-forested Restionaceae wetland at ca. 7000 calibrated (cal) yr BP. Persistence of the non-forest/Restionaceae vegetation state over 7000 years, despite long fire-free intervals, implies that fire was not essential for the maintenance of the non-forest state. We propose that reduced interception and transpiration of the non-forest state resulted in local waterlogging, presenting an eco-hydrological barrier to forest reestablishment over the succeeding 7000 years. We further contend that the rhizomatous nature of the non-forest species presented a reinforcing eco-physical barrier to forest development. Our results satisfy a number of criteria for consideration as an example of a switch between alternative stable states, including different origin and maintenance pathways, and they provide insights into the role of threshold dynamics and hysteresis in forest-non-forest transitions.

AB To better understand the soil carbon dynamics and cycling in terrestrial ecosystems in response to environmental changes, we studied soil respiration, litter decomposition, and their relations to soil temperature and soil water content for 18-months (Aug. 2010-Jan. 2012) in three different-aged Pinus massoniana forests in the Three Gorges Reservoir Area, China. Across the experimental period, the mean total soil respiration and litter respiration were 1.94 and 0.81, 2.00 and 0.60, 2.19 and 0.71 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1), and the litter dry mass remaining was 57.6%, 56.2% and 61.3% in the 20-, 30-, and 46-year-old forests, respectively. We found that the temporal variations of soil respiration and litter decomposition rates can be well explained by soil temperature at 5 cm depth. Both the total soil respiration and litter respiration were significantly positively correlated with the litter decomposition rates. The mean contribution of the litter respiration to the total soil respiration was 31.0%-45.9% for the three different-aged forests. The present study found that the total soil respiration was not significantly affected by forest age when P. masonniana stands exceed a certain age (e.g. >20 years old), but it increased significantly with increased soil temperature. Hence, forest management strategies need to protect the understory vegetation to limit soil warming, in order to reduce the CO2 emission under the currently rapid global warming. The contribution of litter decomposition to the total soil respiration varies across spatial and temporal scales. This indicates the need for separate consideration of soil and litter respiration when assessing the climate impacts on forest carbon cycling.

AB Comparative genomic studies extensively rely on alignments of orthologous sequences. Yet, selecting, gathering, and aligning orthologous exons and protein-coding sequences (CDS) that are relevant for a given evolutionary analysis can be a difficult and time-consuming task. In this context, we developed OrthoMaM, a database of ORTHOlogous MAmmalian Markers describing the evolutionary dynamics of orthologous genes in mammalian genomes using a phylogenetic framework. Since its first release in 2007, OrthoMaM has regularly evolved, not only to include newly available genomes but also to incorporate up-to-date software in its analytic pipeline. This eighth release integrates the 40 complete mammalian genomes available in Ensembl v73 and provides alignments, phylogenies, evolutionary descriptor information, and functional annotations for 13,404 single-copy orthologous CDS and 6,953 long exons. The graphical interface allows to easily explore OrthoMaM to identify markers with specific characteristics (e.g., taxa availability, alignment size, %G+C, evolutionary rate, chromosome location). It hence provides an efficient solution to sample preprocessed markers adapted to user-specific needs. OrthoMaM has proven to be a valuable resource for researchers interested in mammalian phylogenomics, evolutionary genomics, and has served as a source of benchmark empirical data sets in several methodological studies. OrthoMaM is available for browsing, query and complete or filtered downloads at http://www.orthomam.univ-montp2.fr/.

AB Cultural ecosystem services (CES) substantially contribute to human wellbeing as the nonmaterial benefits of ecosystems. However, they remain poorly understood due to their often nonmarket and intangible nature. We analyzed management characteristics of coastal and watershed - based CES in contrast to provisioning and regulatory services from surveys of environmental managers in Hawaii. CES were the most frequently managed type of ecosystem service, a top management priority among local scale decision makers and nongovernmental organizations, and managed for security. However, only 10% of managers could articulate specific policies they used to manage CES. Follow-up interviews with a subset of managers further revealed that half of all CES managed were considered to benefit people beyond the spatial scale in which management decisions were made. Identifying management characteristics of CES will inform the development of indicators to monitor changes in CES, arid develop policies that maintain the relationship between ecosystem function, CES and human wellbeing.

AB Top predators need to develop optimal strategies of resources and habitats utilization in order to optimize their foraging success. At the individual scale, a predator has to maximize his intake of food while minimizing his cost of foraging to optimize his energetic gain. At the ecosystem scale, we hypothesized that foraging strategies of predators also respond to their general energetic constraints. Predators with energetically costly lifestyles may be constrained to select high quality habitats whereas more phlegmatic predators may occupy both low and high quality habitats. The objectives of this study were 1) to investigate predator responses to heterogeneity in habitat quality with reference to their energetic strategies and 2) to evaluate their responses to contemporaneous versus averaged habitat quality. We collected cetacean and seabird data from an aerial survey in the Southwest Indian Ocean, a region characterized by heterogeneous oceanographic conditions. We classified cetaceans and seabirds into energetic guilds and described their habitats using remotely sensed covariates at contemporaneous and time-averaged resolutions and static covariates. We used generalized additive models to predict their habitats at the regional scale. Strategies of habitat utilization appeared in accordance with predators energetic constraints. Cetaceans responded to the heterogeneity in habitat quality, with higher densities predicted in more productive areas. However, the costly Delphininae appeared to be more dependent on habitat quality (showing a 1-to-13 ratio between the lowest and highest density sectors) than the more phlegmatic sperm and beaked whales (showing only a 1-to-3 ratio). For seabirds, predictions primarily reflected colony locations, although the colony effect was stronger for costly seabirds. Moreover, our results suggest that predators may respond better to persistent oceanographic features. To provide a third dimension to habitat quality, cetacean strategies of utilization of the vertical habitat could be related to the distribution of micronekton in the water column.

AB Efforts to conserve tropical forests could be strengthened based on ecological knowledge, such as extinction thresholds in ecological processes. Many studies of extinction thresholds associated with habitat reduction have focused on animals, generally at the patch scale. However, certain plant groups are very interesting models with which to study this type of relationship, such as Myrtaceae in Neotropical forests. Because trees are long-lived organisms, local extinctions in response to habitat loss may occur in different ways due to a time lag. In this study, our objective was to assess the occurrence of extinction thresholds at the landscape scale for Myrtaceae in a large biome and the pattern of species reduction in different tree size classes. We studied nine landscapes with different amounts of available habitat (between 5 and 55 % forest cover) in different parts of the Atlantic Forest in Bahia, Brazil, and in each landscape, we evaluated four plant classes based on tree circumference: saplings (CBH between 8 and 15 cm), young (CBH between 15 and 30 cm) adults (CBH a parts per thousand yen30 cm) and total (all individuals with CBH a parts per thousand yen8 cm). Landscapes with forest cover less than 25 % presented an approximately sixfold reduction in Myrtaceae total species richness compared with landscapes with forest cover greater than 40 %. We identified a relationship with a threshold between the amount of available habitat at the landscape level and Myrtaceae richness, with a reduction in total, sapling and young species below a threshold of 40 % forest cover, whereas adults had an extinction threshold at 30 % forest cover. We discuss the differences among the categories of plants associated with a time lag and the possibilities and limitations in applying these results in environmental management.

AB Amphibians constitute a diverse yet still incompletely characterized clade of vertebrates, in which new species are still being discovered and described at a high rate. Amphibians are also increasingly endangered, due in part to disease-driven threats of extinctions. As an emergency response, conservationists have begun ex situ assurance colonies for priority species. The abundance of cryptic amphibian diversity, however, may cause problems for ex situ conservation. In this study we used a DNA barcoding approach to survey mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variation in captive populations of 10 species of Neotropical amphibians maintained in an ex situ assurance programme at El Valle Amphibian Conservation Center (EVACC) in the Republic of Panama. We combined these mtDNA sequences with genetic data from presumably conspecific wild populations sampled from across Panama, and applied genetic distance-based and character-based analyses to identify cryptic lineages. We found that three of ten species harboured substantial cryptic genetic diversity within EVACC, and an additional three species harboured cryptic diversity among wild populations, but not in captivity. Ex situ conservation efforts focused on amphibians are therefore vulnerable to an incomplete taxonomy leading to misidentification among cryptic species. DNA barcoding may therefore provide a simple, standardized protocol to identify cryptic diversity readily applicable to any amphibian community.

AB Elevated nutrients and sediments are the main factors contributing to the poor biological condition measured in over 40% of US waters, highlighting the need for criteria that can aid management efforts to protect or restore the quality of US waters. A large amount of literature on nutrient criteria has been generated since the USEPA called for their development in 1998. Our objective was to examine this peer-reviewed literature to evaluate two main approaches for criteria development in lotic ecosystems: percentile rank and bivariate predictive statistical analyses. The 25th percentile approach has been examined broadly across USEPA-aggregate nutrient ecoregions, and we found that USEPA-suggested criteria for these aggregate ecoregions were often more conservative than criteria estimated using more current regionally focused data based on our compiled data set. Furthermore, 25th percentile estimates were often less than 75th percentile estimates based on reference sites, suggesting that 75th percentile estimates were not more conservative than 25th percentile estimates. Predictive approaches have focused on establishing linear and nonlinear relationships between water quality and algae, macroinvertebrate, and fish communities; attributing causation; and determining whether threshold points exist that can aid in nutrient criteria development. Most of the predictive approaches have occurred at the state or watershed level and may not be directly comparable to USEPA aggregate ecoregions. However, percentile method estimates often fell within the confidence interval of biological threshold criteria estimates, suggesting overlap and some consensus between the two main approaches.

AB Deer population control is important in wildlife management, because overabundance of deer is a problem worldwide. For practical deer population control, deer population dynamics and the factors that influence them need to be evaluated in low-cost and time-efficient ways. However, in traditional methods of estimation, such as cohort analysis, large numbers of deer need to be caught for many years, and the ages of the deer must be determined. We estimated deer population dynamics by using a Bayesian state-space model with multiple deer abundance indices (seen deer per unit effort, pellet group count, and block count) and numbers of deer hunted and culled in Yamanashi Prefecture, central Japan. In the state process of our state-space model, latent deer abundance at year t in location m (Dt,m), with m being each cell of a grid mesh covering Yamanashi Prefecture, was assumed to decrease annually through hunting and culling, to increase with the population growth rate of each mesh (rm; which was determined from the percentages of forest, evergreen forest, and artificial grassland), and to fluctuate stochastically. In the observation process, Dt,m was assumed to be correlated with the deer abundance indices and a Gaussian white noise in the deer abundance indices. The estimated Dt,m was correlated with each deer abundance index, but the correlation coefficient was the greatest for pellet group density. The percentage of hunted and culled deer needed to reach 30% to reduce the annual growth rate (Dt,m/Dt-1,m). Increasing the percentage of artificial grassland increased rm. Our results showed that 1) deer abundance could be estimated by using only deer abundance indices in addition to population growth rate and the percentage of hunted and culled deer; and 2) preventing the intrusion of deer onto artificial grassland and intensive culling on artificial grassland were important to decrease deer abundance.

AB Premise of the study: Preventing new plant invasions is critical for reducing large-scale ecological change. Most studies have focused on the deliberate introduction of nonnatives via the ornamental plant trade. However, accidental introduction may be an important source of nonnative, invasive plants.
   Methods: Using Web and literature searches, we compiled pathways of introduction to the United States for 1112 nonnative plants identified as invasive in the continental United States. We assessed how the proportion of accidentally and deliberately introduced invasive plants varies over time and space and by growth habit across the lower 48 states.
   Key results: Deliberate introductions of ornamentals are the primary source of invasive plants in the United States, but accidental introductions through seed contaminants are an important secondary source. Invasive forbs and grasses are the most likely to have arrived accidentally through seed contaminants, while almost all nonnative, invasive trees were introduced deliberately. Nonnative plants invading eastern states primarily arrived deliberately as ornamentals, while a high proportion of invasive plants in western states arrived accidentally as seed contaminants. Accidental introductions may be increasing in importance through time. Before 1850, 10 of 89 (11%) of invasive plants arrived accidentally. After 1900, 20 of 65 (31%) arrived accidentally.
   Conclusions: Recently enacted screening protocols and weed risk assessments aim to reduce the number of potentially invasive species arriving to the United States via deliberate introduction pathways. Increasing proportions of accidentally introduced invasive plants, particularly associated with contaminated seed imports across the western states, suggest that accidental introduction pathways also need to be considered in future regulatory decisions.

AB Local fisher knowledge is an important source of information for the adjustment of environmental baselines relative to anthropogenic impacts on marine ecosystems. This knowledge is also susceptible to the shifting baseline syndrome. Four generations of fishers neighbouring a marine park in Eastern Brazil, were surveyed regarding the conservation status of nine reef fish species. Shifts in environmental baselines were detected among fisher generations. Fishers older than 50 years not only caught larger individual fish, but catches of large fish occurred four decades ago, suggesting that bigger fish are in decline in the region. Of nine reef fish species, seven exhibited significant declining catch trends based on information provided by fishers. Such declining status was not reported by all informants of younger generations, so the ability to identify such species increases significantly with fisher age. The fish species most cited as overexploited were Mycteroperca bonaci (Poey), Epinephelus morio (Valenciennes) and Ocyurus chrysurus (Bloch), emphasising that special attention should be given to the management and conservation of these species in Eastern Brazil. These results also showed that knowledge acquired by elder fishers (> 50 years old) can provide valuable insights into the conservation status of reef fish and the adjustment of environmental baselines for proper management of a marine park.

AB Environmental indicators can be used to evaluate natural recovery processes. Although several studies have used ant assemblage metrics as environmental indicators, few try to explain the response of these insect assemblages to forest recovery. Thus, we carried out a vertical ant sampling design to verify the sensitivity of ant assemblages from different microhabitats (epigeic, arboreal and hypogeic) to natural forest recovery. We also verified whether changes to the diversity measures (species richness, composition and evenness) of these assemblages could be predictable and explained by changes in the resource quantity and conditions, and structural and resource heterogeneity that also occur along the natural forest recovery gradient. Additionally, we verified the potential of ant species as indicators of forest recovery. We sampled ants in a pasture and seven forest remnants with different recovery times that represent a forest recovery gradient along a chronosequence. Although, the non response of species richness and evenness, species composition changed along the recovery gradient and the dissimilarity between the ant species composition of pasture and forest habitats increased with the age of the forest remnant. This was supported by ant species indicators of pasture and forest areas pointed out by the IndVal test. The variation of ant species composition of the two groups of habitat types (pasture and forest) could be explained by the different responses of open habitat and forest specialist ants to the increase in vegetation cover along the recovery gradient. Therefore, species composition and indicator species by habitat type seems to be the most predictable data for the use of ants in environmental monitoring programs. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The long-term impacts of wildfires on animal populations are largely unknown. We used time-series data based on a tracking index, from coastal NSW spanning 28 years after a wildfire, to investigate the relative influence of habitat structure, species interactions and climate on post-fire animal population dynamics. The fire had an immediate impact on habitat structure, reducing and simplifying vegetation cover, which then underwent post-fire successional change including an increase and plateau in tree canopy cover; an increase, stabilization and then decline in shrub cover; and an increase in ground litter cover. Population changes of different animal species were influenced by different components of successional change, but there was also evidence that species interactions were important. For example, bandicoots (Isoodon obesulus and Perameles nasuta combined) increased concurrent with an increase in shrub cover then declined at a faster rate than a direct association with senescing shrub cover would suggest, while the feral cat (Felis catus) population changed with the bandicoot population, suggesting a link between these species. Potoroos (Potorous tridactylus) increased 10 years after the fire concurrent with the closing tree canopy, but there was also evidence of a negative association with feral foxes (Vulpes vulpes). Variation in rainfall did not have significant effects on the population dynamics of any species. Our results suggest that changes in habitat structure play a key role in the post-fire dynamics of many ground-dwelling animals and hence different fire regimes are likely to influence animal dynamics through their effects on habitat structure. However, the role of predatorprey interactions, particularly with feral predators, is less clear and further study will require manipulative experiments of predators in conjunction with fire treatments to determine whether feral predator control should be integrated with fire management to improve outcomes for some native species.

AB Aim Macroecological theory predicts that along direct physiological gradients there will be unimodal abundance distributions of species and consistent rates of assemblage turnover. However, the majority of marine studies that have investigated the realized distribution of species along latitudinal or temperature gradients have generally found unimodal distributions to be rare. We assess fish distributions along a temperature gradient in a stable oligotrophic seascape and suggest that unimodal distributions will be more common. Location Nearshore demersal fish habitat extending 1500 km along the coast of south-western Australia. Methods The relative abundances of demersal fish species were sampled off the coast of south-western Australia along a temperature gradient. The confounding influence of other environmental variables was tested, and the assemblage was found to be highly correlated with temperature. For the 20 most abundant species, quantile regression spline models were used to construct a model within which 95% of their abundance was expected to fall. We compared the results from this study with the proportion of unimodal species abundance distributions observed in other studies. Results Of the 20 most abundant species, 19 displayed patterns that indicated temperature was an important factor influencing their range and relative abundance; with 15 species exhibiting unimodal abundance distributions, four having ramped distribution to one end of the sampled range and one showing no consistent pattern. Main conclusions The high diversity and percentage of endemic species in terrestrial and marine habitats of south-western Australia is likely to be due to the stable geological and oceanographic history of the region. In comparison, studies of abundance distribution in other marine systems have been conducted in relatively heterogeneous and productive environments. The old, climatically buffered, oligotrophic seascape of south-western Australia has provided a simple system in which the consistent influence of physiological gradients on the abundance distribution of fish species can be observed.

AB In Argentina, the rapid expansion and intensification of row crop production that has occurred during the last 20 years has resulted in the loss of habitat and spatial heterogeneity in agroecosystems. One of the principal effects of industrialized row crop production is the loss of avian diversity and associated ecosystem services that benefit crop production. To better understand the response of bird species to the intensification and expansion of row crop agriculture in Argentina, and the potential effects on the provision of ecosystems services, we analyzed the relationship between short- and long-term changes in agricultural land use on the densities of six bird species (Milvago chimango, Caracara plancus, Tyrannus savana, Zenaida auriculata, Molothrus bonariensis, and Sturnella supercilliaris) using data from a large-scale, long-term avian monitoring program in central Argentina. Species densities responded individually to long-term landuse changes; T. savana and M. chimango densities were positively related to an increase in the annual cropping area, whereas C. plancus and S. supercilliaris were positively related to the area of non-plowed fields. M. bonariensis and Z. auriculata (considered crop pests) showed a weak relationship with land use. None of the species exhibited response to short-term changes in land-use. Although generalist species can apparently adapt to a diversity of open habitats, species that provide pest control services were also related to semi-natural habitats and thus likely to suffer from land transformation associated with intensive agricultural management. Our results, as well as those found in similar systems, denote strong inferential evidence that the disappearance of remnants of natural and semi-natural habitats in heavily transformed agricultural landscapes will have a substantial negative effect on the provision of pest control services provided by avian abundance and diversity.

AB Traditional regression techniques such as ordinary least squares (OLS) are often unable to accurately model spatially varying data and may ignore or hide local variations in model coefficients. A relatively new technique, geographically weighted regression (GWR) has been shown to greatly improve model performance compared to OLS in terms of higher R (2) and lower corrected Akaike information criterion (AIC(C)). GWR models have the potential to improve reliabilities of the identified relationships by reducing spatial autocorrelations and by accounting for local variations and spatial non-stationarity between dependent and independent variables. In this study, GWR was used to examine the relationship between land cover, rainfall and surface water habitat in 149 sub-catchments in a predominately agricultural region covering 2.6 million ha in southeast Australia. The application of the GWR models revealed that the relationships between land cover, rainfall and surface water habitat display significant spatial non-stationarity. GWR showed improvements over analogous OLS models in terms of higher R (2) and lower AIC(C). The increased explanatory power of GWR was confirmed by the results of an approximate likelihood ratio test, which showed statistically significant improvements over analogous OLS models. The models suggest that the amount of surface water area in the landscape is related to anthropogenic drainage practices enhancing runoff to facilitate intensive agriculture and increased plantation forestry. However, with some key variables not present in our analysis, the strength of this relationship could not be qualified. GWR techniques have the potential to serve as a useful tool for environmental research and management across a broad range of scales for the investigation of spatially varying relationships.

AB With activities that alter the structure and function of the habitat, humans have a direct impact on ecosystems and ecosystem services, i.e., the conditions and processes that sustain human life. In this study, 35 townships in the Yanhe watershed in the Loess Plateau of China were selected. The net primary production (NPP), carbon sequestration and oxygen production (CSOP), water conservation, and soil conservation were the ecosystem services selected and valuated. Human activity was quantified by an integrated human activity index (HAI) based on population density, farmland ratio, and the influence of road networks and residential areas. The NPP, CSOP, and water conservation showed a conspicuous spatial pattern fanning outward from the southwest, while the soil conservation showed an obscure spatial pattern distinguished primarily by the peripheral area surrounding the urbanized areas. Total ecosystem services in the Yanhe watershed demonstrated a decreasing pattern from south to north, and the HAI was in proportion to administrative and economic development. Based on the selected ecosystem services and HAI, we mapped the townships of the Yanhe watershed by cluster analysis, and provided sustainable ecosystem management suggestions, tailored to the social-ecological map.

AB Habituation typically is viewed as a negative consequence of human interactions with wildlife (Higginbottom, 2004; Newsome, Dowling, & Moore, 2005; Shackley, 1996). While animal habituation commonly is used in the laboratory and field-based zoology studies, attempts to consider deliberate habituation specifically in a tourism management context (Shelton, Higham, & Seddon, 2004) has been received unsympathetically by biological scientists and wildlife managers on the grounds that habituation, by definition, is undesirable. This paper puts forward the case that the global and stable behavioural descriptor, habituation, is not the most useful way to formulate most observed lack-of-wildlife-response to visitor approach and observation. It presents an applied behaviour analysis of wildlife habituation that is situated within learning theory. This analysis differentiates between avoidance/approach behaviours, tolerance, habituation and sensitisation. This provides a formulative framework for human-wildlife interactions, that is then considered specifically in terms of tourism businesses seeking to provide sustainable visitor interactions with wild animals. A tourism management model derived from this critique of habituation is presented and discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The idea that humans can assist nature by purposely moving species to suitable habitats to fill the gap between their migration capability and the expected rate of climate change is being increasingly contemplated and debated as an adaptive management option. The interest in assisted migration, both in the scientific community and society at large, is growing rapidly and is starting to be translated into action in Canada. However, the concept is in its infancy; clear terminology has not yet been established and assisted migration still encompasses a broad range of practices. This introductory paper for the special issue of The Forestry Chronicle on the subject of assisted migration describes increasing interest in the subject and its complexity It also provides an overview of the potential scale of assisted migration, proposes a terminology, and briefly introduces the following papers. Overall, the five papers aim to present a comprehensive state of the scientific and operational knowledge and the debate on assisted migration in the context of Canada's forests.

AB Loblolly pine, Pinus taeda L., is one of the most widely planted, commercially and ecologically important tree species in North America. We took an association genetics approach, using an unimproved population of 380 clonally replicated unrelated trees, to test 3938 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in as many genes for association with phenotypic variation in carbon isotope discrimination, foliar nitrogen concentration and total tree height after two growing seasons. Best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP) was used with a spatial adjustment to remove environmental variation from phenotypic data derived from a common garden experiment. After correction for multiple testing, a total of 14 SNPs were associated with the traits of carbon isotope discrimination (n=7), height (n=1) and foliar nitrogen concentration (n=6) using 380 clones. Tails of the population phenotypic distribution were compared for allele frequency differences, revealing 10 SNPs with allele frequency in at least one tail significantly different from the overall population. Eight associated SNPs were in sequences similar to known genes, such as an AP2 transcription factor related to carbon isotope discrimination and glutamate decarboxylase associated with foliar nitrogen concentration, and others were from unknown genes without homologs in Arabidopsis.

AB P>1. Developing the next-generation of species distribution modelling (SDM) requires solutions to a number of widely recognised problems. Here, we address the problem of uncertainty in predictor variables arising from fine-scale environmental variation.
   2. We explain how this uncertainty may cause scale-dependent 'regression dilution', elsewhere a well-understood statistical issue, and explain its consequences for SDM. We then demonstrate a simple, general correction for regression dilution based on Bayesian methods using latent variables. With this correction in place, unbiased estimates of species occupancy vs. the true environment can be retrieved from data on occupancy vs. measured environment, where measured environment is correlated with the true environment, but subject to substantial measurement error.
   3. We then show how applying our correction to multiple co-occurring species simultaneously increases the accuracy of parameter estimates for each species, as well as estimates for the true environment at each survey plot - a phenomenon we call 'neighbourly advice'. With a sufficient number of species, the estimates of the true environment at each plot can become extremely accurate.
   4. Our correction for regression dilution could be integrated with models addressing other issues in SDM, e.g. biotic interactions and/or spatial dynamics. We suggest that Bayesian analysis, as employed here to address uncertainty in predictor variables, might offer a flexible toolbox for developing such next-generation species distribution models.

AB The study of species complexes is of particular interest to understand how evolutionary young species maintain genomic integrity. The Daphnia pulex complex has been intensively studied as it includes species that dominate freshwater environments in the Northern hemisphere and as it is the sole North American complex that shows transitions to obligate parthenogenesis. Past studies using mitochondrial markers have revealed the presence of 10 distinct lineages in the complex. This study is the first to examine genetic relationships among seven species of the complex at nuclear markers (nine microsatellite loci and one protein-coding gene). Clones belonging to the seven species of the Daphnia pulex complex were characterized at the mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase (ND5) gene and at the Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) locus. K-means, principal coordinate analyses and phylogenetic network analyses on the microsatellite data all separated European D. pulicaria, D. tenebrosa, North American D. pulex, D. pulicaria and their hybrids into distinct clusters. The hybrid cluster was composed of diploid and polyploid hybrids with D. pulex mitochondria and some clones with D. pulicaria mitochondria. By contrast, the phylogeny of the D. pulex complex using Rab4 was not well resolved but still showed clusters consisting mostly of D. pulex alleles and others of D. pulicaria alleles. Incomplete lineage sorting and hybridization may obscure genetic relationships at this locus. This study shows that hybridization and introgression have played an important role in the evolution of this complex.

AB Reliable marine benthic habitat maps at regional and national scales are needed to enable the move towards the sustainable management of marine environmental resources. Due to the paucity of adequate biological data and the prohibitive cost of directly sampling benthic biota over large areas, the most effective means of developing broad-scale benthic habitat maps is to use commonly available marine physical data. A new robust method of mapping marine benthic habitats at this scale was developed based on a stratified approach to habitat classification. This approach explicitly uses knowledge of marine benthic ecology to determine an appropriate number of stratification levels, to choose the most suitable environmental variables for each level, and to select ecologically significant boundary conditions (i.e. threshold values) for each variable. Three stratification levels, with nine environmental variables, were created using a spatial segmentation approach. Each level represents major environmental processes and characteristics of the Australian marine benthic environment. The finest scale of benthic habitat was defined by seafloor physical properties of topography, sediment grain size, and seabed shear stress. The intermediate scale was defined by water-column nutrient parameters and bottom water temperature. The broadest scale was defined by a seabed insolation parameter derived from depth data. The classifications of the three stratified levels were implemented using an object-based fuzzy classification technique that recognises that habitats are largely homogenous spatial regions, and transitions between habitats are often gradual. Classification reliability was indicated in confidence maps obtained from the fuzzy classification. Physical habitat diversity was evaluated for the final benthic habitat map that combines the three classifications. The final benthic habitat map identifies the structurally complex continental shelf break as an area of relatively high habitat diversity. Other extensive areas with a high diversity of habitats include the central and southern Great Barrier Reef and adjacent Coral Sea deep-water platforms, the outer shelf and slope of the Great Australian Blight, and extensive areas of shelf and deep water seabed on the south-western and north-western margins. These areas match well with the distribution of large-scale high-relief geomorphic features (e.g., reefs, ridges, seamounts, valleys, and canyons), likely reflecting the strong influence of bedrock outcrops and reefs on habitat diversity. Overall, the new classification method is relatively easily implemented and updated to include new knowledge and data, and can be applied at spatial scales that are useful for effective management of marine resources at various levels of government.

AB Ex situ collections in botanic gardens have great potential in contributing to the conservation of rare plants. However, little is known about the effects of cultivation on the genetic diversity and fitness of garden populations, about genetic changes due to unconscious selection and potential adaptation to the artificial conditions. We compared the genetic variability and fitness of the rare, short-lived perennial Cynoglossum officinale from 12 botanic gardens and five natural populations in Germany. Genetic variability was assessed with eight nuclear microsatellites. Plants were grown in a common garden and performance was measured over 2 years. Mean genetic diversity was very similar in botanic garden and natural populations. However, four of the garden populations exhibited no genetic variability at all. Moreover, the genetic diversity of garden populations decreased with increasing duration of cultivation, indicating genetic drift. Plant performance from natural and garden populations in terms of growth, flowering and seed production was similar and in garden populations only seed mass was strongly related to genetic diversity. Several lines of evidence indicated genetic changes in garden populations in response to cultivation. Seed dormancy was strongly reduced in garden populations, and in response to nutrient addition garden plants increased the size of their main inflorescence, while wild plants increased the number of inflorescences. These changes could be maladaptive in nature and reduce the suitability of garden populations as a source for reintroductions. We suggest that botanic gardens should pay more attention to the problem of potential genetic changes in their plant collections. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Forests in the United States generate many non-market benefits for society that can be enhanced and diminished by wildfire and wildfire management. The Federal Wildland Fire Management Policy (1995, updated 2001), and subsequent Guidance to the Implementation of that policy provided in 2009, require fire management priorities be set on the basis of values to be protected (including natural and cultural resources), costs of protection, and natural resource management objectives (including beneficial fire effects). Implementation of this policy is challenging because those charged with executing the policy have limited information about the value that society places on non-market goods and services at risk. This paper reviews the challenges of accommodating non-market values affected by wildfire in social cost-benefit analysis and proposes an economic research agendum to support more efficient management of wildfire in the United States.

AB Connectivity among populations plays a crucial role in maintaining genetic variation at a local scale, especially in small populations affected strongly by genetic drift. The negative consequences of population disconnection on allelic richness and gene diversity (heterozygosity) are well recognized and empirically established. It is not well recognized, however, that a sudden drop in local effective population size induced by such disconnection produces a temporary disequilibrium in allelic frequency distributions that is akin to the genetic signature of a demographic bottleneck. To document this effect, we used individual-based simulations and empirical data on allelic richness and gene diversity in six pairs of isolated versus well-connected (core) populations of European tree frogs. In our simulations, population disconnection depressed allelic richness more than heterozygosity and thus resulted in a temporary excess in gene diversity relative to mutation drift equilibrium (i.e., signature of a genetic bottleneck). We observed a similar excess in gene diversity in isolated populations of tree frogs. Our results show that population disconnection can create a genetic bottleneck in the absence of demographic collapse.

AB Public expectations of soil management are gradually expanding beyond traditional primary production requirements to include diverse ecosystem services. In Australia, as in many other countries, the accommodation of these new expectations will require shifts in the practice of private land managers. In turn. this may require public intervention and the expenditure of public funds. However, public net benefits from soil management interventions are rarely established, in part due to a lack of understanding of the conceptual links between management changes, soil health, and associated services and benefits. This paper uses an ecosystem services-based approach to examine these links from an Australian perspective.
   Entrenchment of the popular soil health concept in field-based assessments of agricultural production potential was found to limit the concept's applicability to questions of broader public benefit. Without expanding soil health to include more ecological indicators, the concept risks remaining peripheral to contemporary visions of multiple-outcome soil management in Australia. Conceptual and case study links were examined between soil properties and processes, soil-based services, and private and public net benefits. In this framework, benefits were produced from services, and were considered a more tangible point for public understanding and valuation than services. The qualitative case study highlighted many knowledge gaps relating to non-agricultural services and benefits from soils, particularly in the scaling-up of sub-paddock measurements, and in the form and constancy of relationships among services and benefits. Criteria for identifying priority public benefits from soil management were examined, namely, likelihood, degree, consequence, scale, direction, time lag, and valuation. Assumptions about these criteria require rigorous testing so that the what, where, when, and how of public benefits from changed soil management can be more clearly defined. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB Recent climate change has triggered profound reorganization in northeast Atlantic ecosystems, with substantial impact on the distribution of marine assemblages from plankton to fishes. However, assessing the repercussions on apex marine predators remains a challenging issue, especially for pelagic species. In this study, we use Bayesian coalescent modelling of microsatellite variation to track the population demographic history of one of the smallest temperate cetaceans, the harbour porpoise (Phocoena phocoena) in European waters. Combining genetic inferences with palaeo-oceanographic and historical records provides strong evidence that populations of harbour porpoises have responded markedly to the recent climate-driven reorganization in the eastern North Atlantic food web. This response includes the isolation of porpoises in Iberian waters from those further north only approximately 300 years ago with a predominant northward migration, contemporaneous with the warming trend underway since the 'Little Ice Age' period and with the ongoing retreat of cold-water fishes from the Bay of Biscay. The extinction or exodus of harbour porpoises from the Mediterranean Sea (leaving an isolated relict population in the Black Sea) has lacked a coherent explanation. The present results suggest that the fragmentation of harbour distribution range in the Mediterranean Sea was triggered during the warm 'Mid-Holocene Optimum' period (approx. 5000 years ago), by the end of the post-glacial nutrient-rich 'Sapropel' conditions that prevailed before that time.

AB Root allocation and distribution patterns can influence forage yield during periods of moisture or nitrogen stress, as deep-rooted species access water and nutrients found deeper in the soil profile. In a greenhouse study, we examined rooting characteristics to a depth of 50 cm for 21 cool-season forage species (9 grasses, 6 legumes, and 6 forbs) exposed to drought and low N conditions. The goal of this research was to compare root distribution under uniform growing conditions for common grass, legume and non-leguminous forb species found in humid-temperate pastures of the northeast United States. Nitrogen or water stressed grasses generally had greater root biomass and a greater proportion of roots in the 30 to 40 cm soil layer than did stressed legumes or forbs. Low N significantly reduced root weight, but to a lesser extent than the decrease in shoot weight, resulting in an increase in root/shoot ratio. Drought stress reduced shoot weight but had no effect on root weight, also resulting in a greater root/shoot ratio. Drought stress also increased the proportion of deep roots compared with controls, whereas, N stress did not. Comparisons with previously published field studies suggested that information from container-grown plants could provide insights into field results, and also suggested that inherent species differences in root distribution could explain some, but not all, rooting patterns observed in multi-species forage mixtures.

AB In this article, the critical issues in the production of successful bioherbicides have been defined in an effort to stimulate discussion on the underlying science, art of formulation and fermentation and the business of producing and marketing of bioherbicides. To a large extent the science of bioherbicides has focussed on epidemiology, although the enormous potential of molecular technology to improve the efficacy of these agents is being investigated. Some of this potential is coming to fruition in terms of development of tools for the identification and tracking of biological controls, although the genetic modification of biological control agents is still in its infancy. On the other hand, knowledge in the areas of formulation and fermentation is often proprietary in nature. This makes it critical for researchers to work in collaboration with other researchers or industry in these areas. The importance of the appropriate involvement of industry and commercialization partners early in the development process should not be underestimated. Although ad hoc research into biological control should not be discouraged, researchers should be encouraged to think carefully before they postulate on the potential of a bioherbicide based purely on preliminary isolation and pathogenicity testing. As much of the research is specific to a single pathogen/host system, the way ahead in bioherbicide research would appear to be the development of consortia or research nodes in which scientists and business people with backgrounds in the discovery, development and commercialization of biopesticides work collaboratively on a number of projects. There has been movement towards this type of model in countries such as Canada, USA and New Zealand although other countries lag behind. Interestingly, all five of the recently registered bioherbicides in the U. S. and Canada were developed and registered by small-business enterprises or a subsidiary of enterprises with no prior record in pesticide development.
   The constraints to bioherbicides are not in the science, art or business: it is in bringing all of these aspects together in an accessible way and the sharing of intellectual property in an equitable fashion. A new model for the commercialization of bioherbicides should build on currently established research networks, but need to have a stronger link to industry (especially small-medium enterprises) and requires funding for infrastructure and personnel. This funding needs to come from the public sector. Industry is interested in engaging this type of research, but they need to be reassured that the approach is feasible, economic and realistic and that the resources required are available.

AB The performance of statistical methods for modeling resource selection by animals is difficult to evaluate with field data because true selection patterns are unknown. Simulated data based on a known probability distribution, though, can be used to evaluate statistical methods. Models should estimate true selection patterns if they are to be useful in analyzing and interpreting field data. We used simulation techniques to evaluate the effectiveness of three statistical methods used in modeling resource selection. We generated 25 use locations per animal and included 10, 20,40, or 80 animals in samples of use locations. To simulate species of different mobility, we generated use locations at four levels according to a known probability distribution across DeSoto National Wildlife Refuge (DNWR) in eastern Nebraska and western Iowa, USA. We either generated 5 random locations per use location or 10,000 random locations (total) within 4 predetermined areas around use locations to determine how the definition of availability and the number of random locations affected results. We analyzed simulated data using discrete choice, logistic-regression, and a maximum entropy method (Maxent). We used a simple linear regression of estimated and known probability distributions and area under receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) to evaluate the performance of each method. Each statistical method was affected differently by number of animals and random locations used in analyses, level at which selection of resources occurred, and area considered available. Discrete-choice modeling resulted in precise and accurate estimates of the true probability distribution when the area in which use locations were generated was ?: the area defined to be available. Logistic-regression models were unbiased and precise when the area in which use locations were generated and the area defined to be available were the same size: the fit of these models improved with increased numbers of random locations. Maxent resulted in unbiased and precise estimates of the known probability distribution when the area in which use locations were generated was small (home-range level) and the area defined to be available was large (study area). Based on AUC analyses, all models estimated the selection distribution better than random chance. Results from AUC analyses, however, often contradicted results of the linear regression method used to evaluate model performance. Discrete-choice modeling was best able to estimate the known selection distribution in our study area regardless of sample size or number of random locations used in the analyses, but we recommend further studies using simulated data over different landscapes and different resource metrics to confirm our results. our study offers an approach and guidance for others interested in assessing the utility of techniques for modeling resource selection in their study area.

AB Crenate broomrape (Orobanche crenata) is the major constraint for pea cultivation in the Mediterranean Basin and Middle East. Cultivation of resistant varieties would be the most efficient, economical and environmentally friendly way to control this parasite. However, little resistance is available within cultivated pea. Promising sources of resistance have been identified in wild peas but their use in breeding programs is hampered by the polygenic nature of the resistance. The identification of molecular markers linked to the resistance would allow tracking of the underlying genes, facilitating their introgression into pea cultivars. The main objective of this study was the identification of genomic regions associated with resistance to O. crenata. A RIL (Recombinant Inbred Lines) population derived from a cross between a resistant accession of the wild pea Pisum sativum ssp. syriacum, and a susceptible pea variety was screened for resistance to O. crenata under field conditions during two seasons. In addition, resistance reactions at different stages of the O. crenata infection cycle were assessed using a Petri dish method. The approach allowed the identification of four Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) associated with field resistance, assessed as the number of emerged broomrape shoots per pea plant under field conditions. These identified QTLs explained individually from 10 to 17% of the phenotypic variation. In addition QTLs governing specific mechanisms of resistance, such as low induction of O. crenata seed germination, lower number of established tubercles per host root length unit, and slower development of tubercles were also identified. Identified QTLs explained individually from 8 to 37% of the variation observed depending on the trait. Host plant aerial biomass and root length were also assessed and mapped. Both traits were correlated with the level of O. crenata infection and three out of the four QTLs controlling resistance under field conditions co-localized with QTLs controlling plant aerial biomass or root length. The relationship observed among these traits and resistance is discussed.

AB Black spruce is one of the most important boreal tree species in Canada. In the current ecosystem-based management context, commercial thinning (CT) could be a sound choice for attaining sustainable forest management while still achieving maximum returns on competitive timber markets. Through stand density regulation, CT aims to increase tree growth and enhances stand productivity, but the pattern and level of treatment responses are still unknown. This study examined the radial growth response of roots and stems to CT in 10 thinned stands and their controls. A split-plot unbalanced model was developed to describe growth variations over time. The study shows that CT leads to an increase in the radial growth of stems and roots for at least 10 years after the treatment. The 10-year post-treatment radial growth increment of stems is from 20 to 100 per cent higher than the pre-treatment 10-year mean growth. Response depends upon tree diameter and competition, with the biggest trees exhibiting the lowest response to the treatment. Nevertheless, these variables only explain a fraction of the response (R-2 = 0.0511), suggesting that much of the observed variation may be due to variability between the stands and between trees within a stand. Moreover, stem growth response is correlated with, but lags behind root growth response. This study suggests that CT results may be enhanced by the selection of retained trees based on initial diameter at breast height.

AB Statistical power is critical in conservation for detecting genetic differences in space or time from allele frequency data. Organelle and nuclear genetic markers have fundamentally different transmission dynamics; the potential effect of these differences on power to detect divergence have been speculated on but not investigated. We examine, analytically and with computer simulations, the relative performance of organelle and nuclear markers under basic, ideal situations. We conclude that claims of a generally higher resolving power of either marker type are not correct. The ratio R = F-ST,(organelle)/F-ST,F-nuclear varies between 1 and 4 during differentiation and this greatly affects the power relationship. When nuclear F-ST is associated with organelle differentiation four times higher, the power of the organelle marker is similar to two nuclear loci with the same allele frequency distribution. With large sample sizes (n >= 50) and several populations or many alleles per locus (>= 5), the power difference may typically be disregarded when nuclear F-ST > 0.05. To correctly interpret observed patterns of genetic differentiation in practical situations, the expected F(ST)s and the statistical properties (i.e., power analysis) of the genetic markers used should be evaluated, taking the observed allele frequency distributions into consideration.

AB Background: The tick-borne pathogen Anaplasma marginale, which is endemic worldwide, is the type species of the genus Anaplasma (Rickettsiales: Anaplasmataceae). Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus is the most important tick vector of A. marginale in tropical and subtropical regions of the world. Despite extensive characterization of the genetic diversity in A. marginale geographic strains using major surface protein sequences, little is known about the biogeography and evolution of A. marginale and other Anaplasma species. For A. marginale, MSP1a was shown to be involved in vector-pathogen and host-pathogen interactions and to have evolved under positive selection pressure. The MSP1a of A. marginale strains differs in molecular weight because of a variable number of tandem 23-31 amino acid repeats and has proven to be a stable marker of strain identity. While phylogenetic studies of MSP1a repeat sequences have shown evidence of A. marginale-tick co-evolution, these studies have not provided phylogeographic information on a global scale because of the high level of MSP1a genetic diversity among geographic strains.
   Results: In this study we showed that the phylogeography of A. marginale MSP1a sequences is associated with world ecological regions (ecoregions) resulting in different evolutionary pressures and thence MSP1a sequences. The results demonstrated that the MSP1a first (R1) and last (RL) repeats and microsatellite sequences were associated with world ecoregion clusters with specific and different environmental envelopes. The evolution of R1 repeat sequences was found to be under positive selection. It is hypothesized that the driving environmental factors regulating tick populations could act on the selection of different A. marginale MSP1a sequence lineages, associated to each ecoregion.
   Conclusion: The results reported herein provided the first evidence that the evolution of A. marginale was linked to ecological traits affecting tick vector performance. These results suggested that some A. marginale strains have evolved under conditions that support pathogen biological transmission by R. microplus, under different ecological traits which affect performance of R. microplus populations. The evolution of other A. marginale strains may be linked to transmission by other tick species or to mechanical transmission in regions where R. microplus is currently eradicated. The information derived from this study is fundamental toward understanding the evolution of other vector-borne pathogens.

AB Aim
   The transferability of species distribution models requires that species show climatic equilibrium throughout their entire distribution area. We test this assumption for the case of the spotted hyena, Crocuta crocuta, a large carnivore that has shifted its distribution over the last 100,000 years from a widespread Eurasian and African range to its current geographical distribution, restricted to the Sub-Saharan areas of the African continent.
   Location
   Western Eurasia and Africa.
   Methods
   The current realized distribution of C. crocuta was estimated using presences and reliable absences as well as climatic, land-cover and anthropic variables as predictors. The potential distribution was estimated using presences and a set of pseudo-absences selected from localities outside climatically suitable localities, with only climatic variables serving as predictors. The current potential distribution was transferred to the Last Interglacial period (126,000 yr bp) using the palaeoclimatic data yielded by the GENESIS 2 general circulation model, and validated with European fossil data. Generalized linear models were used on all occasions.
   Results
   Climatic variables are able to predict the current distribution of the species with high accuracy. The geographical projection of this model indicates that the species is distributed over almost all of its potential suitable area, which allows us to suppose that the current distribution of this species is in climatic equilibrium. However, the time transference of model predictions for the western Eurasian region reveals almost no suitable conditions for hyenas, despite the widespread presence of C. crocuta fossil remains on this continent during the Last Interglacial period.
   Main conclusions
   Our results indicate that, even when model results suggest a climatic equilibrium for a species distribution, the time transferability of such models does not necessarily provide realistic results. This occurs because the current geographical range does not allow estimations of all of the environmental requirements of a species. Therefore, any model trained with current data risks underestimating the potential suitable environmental and geographical range for species in a new area or time period.

AB Indirect topographic variables have been used successfully its surrogates for disturbance processes in plant species distribution models (SDM) in Mountain environments. However, no SDM Studies have directly tested the performance of disturbance variables.
   In this study, we developed two disturbance variables: it geomorphic index (GEO) and all index of snow redistribution by wind (SNOW). These were developed in order to assess how they improved both the fit and predictive power of presence-absence SDM based On commonly used topoclimatic (TC) variables for 91 plants in the Western Swiss Alps. The individual Contribution of the disturbance variables was compared to TC variables. Maps of models were prepared to spatially test the effect of disturbance variables.
   On average, disturbance variables significantly improved the fin but not the predictive power of the TC models and their individual contribution was weak (5.6% for GEO and 3.3% for SNOW). However their maximum individual contribution was important (24.7% and 20.7%). Finally, maps including disturbance variables (i) were significantly divergent from TC models in terms of predicted suitable surfaces and connectivity between potential habitats, and (ii) were interpreted its more ecologically relevant.
   Disturbance variables did not improve the transferability of models in the local scale in a complex mountain system, and the performance and contribution Of these variables were highly species-specific. However, improved spatial projections and change in connectivity are important issues When preparing projections under climate change because the future range size of the species win determine the sensitivity to changing conditions.

AB Acoustic surveys provide valuable information on the abundance and distribution of many fish species, but are particularly effective for schooling pelagic fish of commercial importance. However, despite recent advances in multifrequency processing, the technique still requires some subjective judgement when allocating the acoustic data, fish-school echotraces, to particular species-the so-called "scrutiny process". This is assisted by "ground truth" trawling and operator experience of relating trawl data to echotraces of particular fish schools. In this paper, a method to identify species based on "classification trees" is applied to data from a component of the International North Sea Herring Acoustic Survey. Classification trees may be considered as a variant of decision trees, and have properties that are intuitive to biologists, because they are similar to the keys used for the biological identification of species. The method described here incorporates a multifrequency fish-school filter, image analysis to isolate fish-school echotraces, and finally, a classification-tree system using the multifrequency information from the ground-truthed echotraces that can be translated into a processing tool for objective species allocation. The classification-tree system is compared with the traditional method of expert-based scrutiny. Unlike the latter, however, a measure of uncertainty is attributed to the classification-tree approach and this could be propagated through the acoustic-survey estimation procedure as a component of the total uncertainty in the abundance estimate.

AB Plant abundance data are often analysed using standard statistical procedures without considering their distributional features and the underlying ecological processes. However, plant abundance data, e.g. when measured in biodiversity monitoring programs, are often sampled using a hierarchical sampling procedure, and since plant abundance data in a hierarchical sampling procedure are typically both zero-inflated and over-dispersed, the use of a standard statistical procedure is sub-optimal and not the best possible practice in the modelling of plant abundance data. Two distributions (the zero-inflated generalised binomial distribution and the zero-inflated bounded beta distribution) are suggested as possible distributions for analysing either discrete, continuous. or ordinal hierarchically sampled plant cover data.

AB Microsatellite genotyping from samples with varying quality can result in an uneven distribution of errors. Previous studies reporting error rates have focused on estimating the effects of both randomly distributed and locus-specific errors. Sample-specific errors, however, can also significantly affect results in population studies despite a large sample size. From two studies including six microsatellite markers genotyped from 272 sperm whale DNA samples, and 33 microsatellites genotyped from 213 bowhead whales, we investigated the effects of sample- and locus-specific errors on calculations of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The results of a jackknife analysis in these two studies identified seven individuals that were highly influential on estimates of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium for six different markers. In each case, the influential individual was homozygous for a rare allele. Our results demonstrate that Hardy-Weinberg P values are very sensitive to homozygosity in rare alleles for single individuals, and that > 50% of these cases involved genotype errors likely due to low sample quality. This raises the possibility that even small, normal levels of laboratory errors can result in an overestimate of the degree to which markers are out of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and hence overestimate population structure. To avoid such bias, we recommend routine identification of influential individuals and multiple replications of those samples.

AB The combustion of fossil fuels and the resultant impacts on climate may now represent one of the largest environmental threats. In the Mediterranean Sea, changes in bio-chemical and physical seawater properties resulting from global warming are likely to alter marine biodiversity and productivity, trigger trophic web mismatches and encourage diseases, toxic algal bloom and propagation of thermophilic species. This review highlights the current and potential threats Of climate change to the Mediterranean marine ecosystems, including cetaceans, and stresses the emergent necessity for more integrated regulations and policies for the protection of marine biodiversity. For instance, in the Mediterranean Sea, the distribution and abundance of the small euphausid species Meganyctiphanes norvegica is correlated with specific hydrobiological parameters including seawater temperature, salinity and current patterns. Situated at the northern limit of its ecological tolerance, this species, which constitutes the only known food supply of the fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus) in this region, might be affected by climate change-induced alteration of ocean circulation.

AB Commercial coral reef fisheries in Pohnpei (Micronesia) extract approximately 1,521 kg of reef fish daily (similar to 500 MT year(-1)) from 152 km(2) of surrounding reef. More than 153 species were represented during surveys, with 25 species very common or common within combined-gear catch. Acanthurids contributed the greatest to catch volume, with bluespine unicornfish, Naso unicornis, and orangespine unicornfish, Naso lituratus, among the most frequently observed herbivores. Nighttime spearfishing was the dominant fishing method and inner lagoon areas were primarily targeted. A seasonal sales ban (March-April), intended to reduce pressure on reproductively active serranids, significantly increased the capture volume of other families. Catch was significantly greater during periods of low lunar illumination, suggesting higher fishing success or greater effort, or both. The marketed catch was dominated by juveniles and small adults, based on fishes of known size at sexual maturity. Artificially depressed market prices appear to be catalyzing (potential or realized) overfishing by increasing the volume of fish needed to offset rising fuel prices. These results support the need for comprehensive fisheries management that produces sustainable fishing and marketing practices and promotes shared management and enforced responsibilities between communities and the state. To be effective, management should prohibit nighttime spearfishing.

AB Evolutionary trajectories of codistributed taxa with comparable ecological preferences and dispersal abilities may be similarly impacted by historical landscape-level processes. Species' responses to changes in a shared biogeographic landscape may be purely concerted, completely independent, or classified as falling within an intermediate part of the continuum bounded by these two extremes. With sufficient molecular data, temporal contrasts of congruence among taxa with respect to these responses can be made. Such contrasts provide insights into the relative influence of ancient versus more recent climatic (and other) impacts on genetic structuring. Using phylogenetic, allele frequency, and genotypic data from two low-mobility, rotting-log-adapted (saproxylic) springtail species (Collembola) from an isolated 100-km-long section of the Great Dividing Range in southeastern Australia, we tested the concerted-response hypothesis over three timescales. Tests of phylogeographic, demographic, and contemporary population-genetic congruence were performed using an integrative approach that draws on both direct (pattern-based) and indirect (scenario-based) analyses. Our data revealed a general pattern of broad-scale similarities in species' responses to the interaction between Pleistocene climatic cycles and landscape setting, overlaid with some species-specific differences on local geographic and more recent temporal scales. This general pattern of phylogeographic congruence was accompanied by evidence for contemporaneous demographic incongruence indicating that, even at relatively small spatial scales, biogeographic context can exert an overarching influence on genetic structuring.

AB 1. As a result of the role that temperature plays in many aquatic processes, good predictive models of annual maximum near-surface lake water temperature across large spatial scales are needed, particularly given concerns regarding climate change. Comparisons of suitable modelling approaches are required to determine their relative merit and suitability for providing good predictions of current conditions. We developed models predicting annual maximum near-surface lake water temperatures for lakes across Canada using four statistical approaches: multiple regression, regression tree, artificial neural networks and Bayesian multiple regression.
   2. Annual maximum near-surface (from 0 to 2 m) lake water-temperature data were obtained for more than 13 000 lakes and were matched to geographic, climatic, lake morphology, physical habitat and water chemistry data. We modelled 2348 lakes and three subsets thereof encompassing different spatial scales and predictor variables to identify the relative importance of these variables at predicting lake temperature.
   3. Although artificial neural networks were marginally better for three of the four data sets, multiple regression was considered to provide the best solution based on the combination of model performance and computational complexity. Climatic variables and date of sampling were the most important variables for predicting water temperature in our models.
   4. Lake morphology did not play a substantial role in predicting lake temperature across any of the spatial scales. Maximum near-surface temperatures for Canadian lakes appeared to be dominated by large-scale climatic and geographic patterns, rather than lake-specific variables, such as lake morphology and water chemistry.

AB Landscape change is driven by economic, demographic and cultural factors operating at a range of spatial and temporal scales. However, landscapes developed for agriculture often retain some wooded areas or paddock trees. The study aimed to identify the relationships between, and influence of, the demographic, economic and cultural values of landholders on the retention of native trees on farms in the Brigalow Belt, Queensland. Two response variables were tested: the proportion of total tree cover on all soil types, and the proportion of tree cover on fertile soils most suitable for agriculture. Explanatory variables were grouped into five conceptual areas: economic factors, demographic characteristics, cultural/social values, attachment to property, and opinions about vegetation management control. Principal components analysis and generalised linear models were used to select and assess the influence of the explanatory variables. An economic factor, farm size, had the strongest influence on both response variables, although the effect was less strong for tree cover on fertile soils. Agreement that tree cover was attractive (a cultural value) and attendance on training courses (a demographic characteristic) were also influential, together with other economic factors recognising production benefits from wooded areas. We conclude that a better understanding of social, economic and cultural factors that influence landholders' decisions about how much tree cover to retain on their property is a prerequisite to targeting passive landscape restoration in areas where over-clearing is threatening landscape health.

AB Aim Water pH and conductivity are known to be major environmental factors controlling the species composition of nutrient-poor wetlands. Based on the analysis of two large data sets of species co-occurrence, sampled along the entire pH/calcium gradient, we explored whether species exhibit similar or different ecological behaviour in the two regions.
   Location West Carpathians (central Europe) and Bulgaria (south-eastern Europe), situated 800 km apart. Bulgaria represents a range margin for many mire species.
   Methods The probability of occurrence of the 41 most common species along the pH and conductivity gradients was assessed using logistic regression fitted by means of generalized additive models. The species optimum and amplitude were determined. To check the possible effect of competitive release, we estimated where the potential maximum number of species (maximum overlap in realized niches) occurs along the base richness gradient.
   Results Most of the 41 frequently occurring species showed a significant response to water pH and ln-transformed conductivity (approximating total mineral richness) in both regions. Eight species showed a shift in pH optimum greater than one unit, while 12 species showed the same or a larger shift along the conductivity gradient. Nearly all these striking shifts were connected to an extension of species tolerance towards mineral-poor acid habitats in Bulgaria, which causes links between species and measured factors to be conspicuously weaker in Bulgaria than in the West Carpathians. Regarding ecological amplitude, 24 species exhibited a wider tolerance to water conductivity in the West Carpathians, whereas 17 species exhibited a wider tolerance in Bulgaria.
   Main conclusions A distinctive variation in the realized niche was observed in a large portion of the species examined. Niche shifts between local populations of the same species were similar to those of closely related vicariant species. Ecotypic adaptation within species is a possible explanation for this pattern. Other possible explanations (competitive release, specific habitat conditions, compensation for climate) seem to be less justified. The local populations of rich-fen species may have adapted to mineral-poor acid conditions in the high crystalline mountains of Bulgaria during dry periods of pleniglacials.

AB In the absence of other life-history constraints, fishes that can feed at low trophic levels (i.e., omnivores/detritivores) are predicted to be successful invaders because their food resources during the colonization and integration phases of the invasion are rarely limiting. Accordingly, we hypothesized that trophic position of non-native fishes in five mid-western and south-western U.S. river systems would be lower than native fishes. By standardizing delta N-15 values with a common invertebrate (chironomids) across sites, we were able to evaluate differences in trophic position between natives and non-natives across sample locations and years. Our data tend to support this hypothesis, but there was notable spatial and temporal variation in this pattern. Moreover, three of four species generally fed at lower trophic positions in their introduced ranges than their native ranges. Although many factors influence the success of introduced species, our data suggest that the ability to forage on low-quality resources is a favourable trait for invasive fishes in lotic systems. Because these fishes feed at low trophic positions, it is important to consider how they will influence invaded systems, in contrast to invaders that feed at higher trophic positions. Future studies that evaluate the resistance of communities to invaders from different trophic positions would help understand the mechanisms that control the establishment and spread of species with different life-history traits.

AB Comprehensive evaluations of multiple genetic factors are rarely undertaken in rehabilitation attempts of extirpated populations, despite a growing need to address why some rehabilitation projects succeed and others fail. Using temporally-spaced samples of microsatellite DNA, we tested several genetic hypotheses that might explain an unsuccessful attempt to re-establish Atlantic salmon populations (Salmo salar) in two rivers of the inner Bay of Fundy, Canada. Census sizes (N) in both populations plummeted to near zero from initial increases after reintroduction/human-mediated recolonization occurred. Over the same period (1974-1996), both populations were characterized by low or relatively low effective sizes (N (e) ) and temporally unstable genetic structuring, whereas neighbouring populations, known historically for their significant salmon production, were not. Despite evidence for genetic bottlenecking and continual linkage disequilibrium over time in both populations, neither exhibited detectable inbreeding or a significant loss of allelic diversity or heterozygosity relative to known donor/source populations. Ratios of N (e) to N also increased with decreasing N in both populations, implying a buffering capacity against losses of genetic diversity at depressed abundances. Most significantly, multiple lines of evidence were consistent with the hypothesis that there has been substantial and recurrent asymmetric migration (migration rate, m) from neighbouring areas into both populations even after initial rehabilitation. This included migration from a historically productive population that became extirpated during the course of rehabilitation efforts, indicating that both populations might have naturally depended on immigration from neighbouring areas for persistence. Our results highlight the value of incorporating temporal genetic data beyond commonly used metrics of neutral genetic diversity (F-ST, allelic richness, heterozygosity) to evaluate rehabilitation successes or failures. They also illustrate how the joint evaluation of multiple genetic concerns in rehabilitation attempts, at spatial scales beyond donor and rehabilitated populations, is useful for focusing future rehabilitation efforts.

AB Native Murray cod (Maccullochella peelii peelii) are listed as a nationally vulnerable species, whereas non-native common carp (Cyprinus carpio) are widespread and abundant. Understanding key aspects of life history, such as movement patterns and habitat selection by juvenile Murray cod and common carp, might be useful for conserving Murray cod populations and controlling common carp numbers. We used radio-telemetry to track eight juvenile Murray cod and seven juvenile common carp in the Murray River, Australia, between March and July 2001. Common carp occupied a significantly greater total linear range (mean +/- SD: 1721 +/- 1118 m) than Murray cod (mean +/- SD: 318 +/- 345 m) and the average daily movement was significantly greater for common carp (mean +/- SD: 147 +/- 238 m) than for Murray cod (mean +/- SD: 15 +/- 55 m). All Murray cod and five of the seven common carp displayed site fidelity or residency to one, two or three locations. Murray cod were found only in the mainstream Murray River among submerged woody habitats, whereas common carp occurred equally in mainstream and offstream areas, and among submerged wood and aquatic vegetation. Murray cod were found in deeper (mean +/- SD: 2.3 +/- 0.78 m) and faster waters (mean +/- SD: 0.56 +/- 0.25 m center dot s(-1)) compared with common carp (mean +/- SD: 1 +/- 0.54 m; 0.08 +/- 0.09 m center dot s(-1)) respectively. The presence of juvenile Murray cod only amongst submerged wood is an indication that these habitats are important and should be preserved. Conversely, juvenile common carp were equally present among all habitats sampled, suggesting that habitat selection is less specific, possibly contributing to their widespread success.

This type of approach aims to reproduce the main attributes of natural landscapes in order to maintain ecosystems within their natural range of variability and avoid creating an environment to which species are not adapted. By comparing attributes associated with natural fire regimes and current forest management, we were able to identify four major differences for the black spruce forest of the Clay Belt. The maintenance of older forests, the spatial extent of cutover areas, the maintenance of residuals within cutovers and disturbance severity on soils are major issues that should be addressed. Silvicultural strategies that mitigate differences between natural and managed forests are briefly discussed.

AB Coral reefs can be degraded by a variety of perturbations, including bleaching and predation by crown-of-thorns starfish. The combination of these disturbances has contributed to a global decline of live coral cover on reefs. While the effects of bleaching and starfish predation on corals are relatively well known, their consequences for fish communities are less understood. We compared fish assemblages associated with 2 coral species, Pocillopora damicornis and Seriatopora hystrix, among 3 coral health categories: (1) live, (2) degraded and (3) dead colonies with recent algal growth. Categories 2 and 3 occur sequentially during the first few weeks following bleaching or crown-of-thorns starfish predation. The abundance of species with an obligate association with live coral differed among coral health categories. Average total abundance of all fish species was lowest in algal-covered colonies of both coral species and these assemblages were dominated by species that are not closely associated with live coral. Lower fish abundance on algal-covered colonies was largely due to the low number of small size classes (new recruits and juveniles). This study suggests that habitat health may play an important role in structuring coral-associated fish assemblages.

AB Studies of social insect invasions to date have focused primarily on highly eusocial insects such as ants and yellowjacket wasps. Yet insect societies without fixed, morphological caste systems may be particularly good invaders due to their behavioral flexibility, as demonstrated by the recent invasion of the European paper wasp Polistes dominulus into North America. Here we provide a review of this ongoing invasion in terms of (1) population genetic variation in P. dominulus, and (2) comparative behavior and ecology of P. dominulus vs. the native P. fuscatus. We present new genetic evidence supporting the occurrence of multiple independent introductions of P. dominulus into the USA, confirming previous results demonstrating relatively high genetic variation in introduced populations. We also present behavioral and demographic evidence suggesting that P. dominulus is displacing the native P. fuscatus in at least part of its range, most likely due to the superior productivity and survivorship of P. dominulus colonies. We review data from comparative studies where the two species are sympatric and discuss possible mechanisms contributing to the differences between them. Finally, we discuss the ecological impacts of this invasion and the role of P. dominulus as a model organism for invasion biology.

AB The demand for live bottlenose dolphins for commercial use is growing in Mexico, making the need for stock assessment and management ever more essential given their protected status. Tursiops truncatus is known to exhibit high levels of phenotypic polymorphisms. in the Gulf of California (GC), coastal and offshore ecotypes have been identified based on morphological, behavioral and ecological evidence, including different prey and habitat preferences. However, the extent to which this ecological and phenotypic variation is genetically correlated is unknown. Here we assess this correlation in GC bottlenose dolphins classified as coastal or offshore based on habitat, morphological and trophic evidence. Significant (p < 0.0001) haplotype heterogeneity (exact test) and genetic differentiation (F-ST = 0.069) were found in the mitochondrial control region, indicating some reproductive isolation between ecotypes. As elsewhere, coastal dolphins were less diverse than offshore. Phylogenetic analyses revealed paraphyletic coastal and offshore lineages and no evidence of lineage sorting, possibly due to recent isolation or gene flow. This is the first time that genetic, morphological and stable isotope evidence has been used to recognize ecotypes as different stocks for management purposes in bottlenose dolphins. our results indicate that diversifying forces are shaping their phenotypic and genetic variation in the GC. Management and conservation efforts in this strategic region should aim to preserve these forces. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Introduced common carp, Cyprinus carpio L., is the most abundant large fish in the Murray-Darling Basin and past studies have considered it non-migratory. Movement information is, however, important for targeting control efforts to appropriate habitats and spatial scales. Movement patterns of common carp in the Murray River were investigated between November 1999 and August 2001. In total, 3337 common carp were boat electric fished and externally tagged. Of the 293 (8.8%) fish recaptured, up to 1898 days later, the majority (80%) moved < 5 km. However, over 7% of the tagged population moved >= 100 km, and the maximum distance was 890 km. Intermediate-sized males moved the greatest distances, usually downstream. Conversely, females and larger males remained close to floodplain spawning areas. For improved management, there is a need to recognise different movement strategies within common carp populations.

AB Ecological communities are shaped, in part, by the manner in which similar species consume and partition food resources. To better understand the structure of a mammalian carnivore community from a prairie habitat in central North America, we determined the dietary breadth and overlap of sympatric American badgers Taxidea taxus, coyotes Canis latrans, red foxes Vulpes vulpes, raccoons Procyon lotor and striped skunks Mephitis mephitis, via stomach content analysis of 411 carcasses salvaged as part of a predator control program in southern Saskatchewan, Canada (2000-2001). Carnivores consumed a total of 25 separate food items; for all species except raccoons, the majority of stomachs contained mammals, whereas other foods such as amphibians, bird remains and insects were also recovered. Raccoon stomachs tended to contain wheat seed, eggshells and birds. Dietary breadth varied among the five carnivore species, being narrowest for raccoons and widest for skunks. Overall, dietary overlap tended to be highest for species pairings associated with the highest level of presumed niche similarity, which included raccoon-skunk and coyote-fox dyads. Yet, levels of dietary overlap exhibited notable interannual variability for most species pairings. The assessment of a larger assemblage of carnivores within a North American prairie community shows that marked interspecific and temporal variation in dietary breadth and overlap may characterize a guild of sympatric species occupying similar habitat.

AB To set conservation priorities, scientists should be able to assess the relative threats posed by the effects of loss of genetic variability, inbreeding and outbreeding as these can generate 'genetic stress'. Developmental instability (DI) has been suggested as an indicator of stress, possibly being more sensitive than other measures. However, there is controversy as to whether DI is an accurate and reliable tool for assessing the degree of genetic stress. After 50 years of the presentation of Lerner's conjecture, there are still several unresolved questions about the relationship between DI and genetic stress. Here, we review studies on mechanisms behind DI. The current status on the use of DI as an indicator of genetic stress is discussed, and suggestions are presented on how to obtain more knowledge on the potential of DI in an evolutionary context.

AB Population genetic tools have the potential to answer key questions in pest management including quantifying the number of genetically distinct populations represented in an invasion, the number of individuals present, whether populations are expanding or contracting, identifying the origin of invasive individuals, the number of separate introduction events that have occurred and in which order, and the rate that individuals are moving between populations. Genetic methods have only recently gained sufficient resolution to address these questions due to advances in laboratory techniques coupled with an increase in computational power. In combination, these methods may lead to a more comprehensive understanding of the dynamics of invasions. The expansion of the European starling (Sturnus vulgaris) into Western Australia is used as an applied example of how genetic methods can be integrated to provide vital information to improve pest-management strategies. Invasion events also may provide a unique opportunity to test some of these methodologies.

AB Biological diversity is complex and can be described and quantified in various ways. Research exploring the consequences of biodiversity for ecosystem functioning has generally focused on the effects of four components of biodiversity: species richness and composition, and functional group richness and composition. Most of the research to date has focused on biodiversity effects within single trophic levels. The aim of this study was to compare the relative effects of these four components of biological diversity across pond food webs using aquatic mesocosm experiments in which all four community properties were manipulated independently. Functional groups were defined in terms of trophic groups, and consisted of aquatic macrophytes, periphyton grazers, and invertebrate predators. Species composition and species richness were manipulated within functional groups. Ecosystem response variables included the final biomass of the manipulated taxa (macrophytes, grazers, and predators), ecosystem rates (productivity and decomposition), and trophic structure (phytoplankton and periphyton biomass). Results reveal strong effects of species composition on a significant proportion of ecosystem response variables. In contrast, species richness, functional group richness, and functional group composition altered the biomass of the manipulated taxa, but had no additional effects on other ecosystem variables. Results suggest that the roles of species in ecosystems, when considered in a food web context, are often the result of both direct and indirect effects that are difficult to predict based on the association of a species to a particular functional group. If a goal of biodiversity research is to predict the response of ecosystems to biodiversity loss, effects of composition and species losses across food webs must be fully integrated into biodiversity-ecosystem functioning research.

We claim that plant invasion ecology can benefit greatly from further and better comparisons at regional and global scales. In this note we discuss the potentials and limitations of comparing climatically analogous regions to provide novel insights into the mechanisms of alien plant invasions. Comparisons among areas with similar climates have the advantage that some features of the abiotic environment are within a narrower range of variation, enabling the researcher to focus on the effects of propagule pressure, microenvironmental differences and, more importantly, the biotic environment in the invasion process. However, there are two major issues that limit the strengths of such comparisons: (1) non-standardized databases of alien species, especially in less developed countries; and (2) deficient sampling designs. We argue that we should take advantage of comparative studies of alien plant invasions across regions with similar climates not only to obtain useful insights about invasions, but to search for generalities beyond invasion ecology that contribute to our knowledge of natural systems.

AB The effects of recent colonization on the aphid parasitoid, Diaeretiella rapae (M'Intosh) (Hymenoptera: Braconidae: Aphidiidae), in Western Australia were investigated. When compared with populations from the Old World, the results of a microsatellite analysis show that the insects have low allelic length and low allele frequency variation, revealing that these individuals experienced a significant founder effect. Marked genetic differentiation between populations was also revealed, which has potentially important implications for host utilization in this species when introduced to a new geographical area(s). Low genetic variation and gene flow in a founder population could limit evolutionary potential in Australia, including the ability of a population to mount a response to newly introduced hosts, such as the Russian wheat aphid, Diuraphis noxia (Mordvilko). Although the actual importance of genetic diversity in the success of biological control agents is unclear, current theory concerning the potential impact of genetic bottlenecks on additive genetic variance is discussed.

AB Although analyses of intraspecific variability are an important prerequisite for species identification assays, only a few studies have focused on population genetics and historical biogeography of sturgeon species. Here we present the first study on genetic variability of the last remaining Adriatic sturgeon, Acipenser naccarii, derived from mitochondrial and nuclear DNA. Our mitochondrial DNA analyses arranged individuals into three distinguished mitochondrial DNA haplogroups (Po1, Po2 and Buna). Two haplogroups (Po1 and Buna) were correlated to geographical distribution, whereas the third (Po2) was not. It was, however, very closely related to one lineage of its Ponto-Caspian sister species, A. gueldenstaedtii. The distribution of nuclear markers (microsatellites and amplified fragment length polymorphism) was strongly correlated to geographical distribution. An assignment test based on nuclear data placed no specimen of A. naccarii to A. gueldenstaedtii and vice versa. Therefore, the presence of gueldenstaedtii-like haplotypes within the Po population is either the result of a postglacial introgression or an ancestral polymorphism and does not indicate a hybrid population. The most valuable tool for forensic species identification purposes is one diagnostic deletion separating all A. naccarii from A. gueldenstaedtii. As both A. naccarii populations are genetically differentiated, stocking of sturgeon from the Po River in Italy into waters of the Buna River would jeopardize the genetic differences between both populations and should thus be avoided.

AB Genetic information has played an important role in the development of management units by focusing attention on the evolutionary properties and genetics of populations. Wildlife authorities cannot hope to manage species effectively without knowledge of geographical boundaries and demic structure. The present investigation provides an analysis of mitochondiral DNA and microsatellite data, which is used to infer both historical and contemporary patterns of population structuring and dispersal in the eastern grey kangaroo (Macropus giganteus) in Australia. The average level of genetic variation across sample locations was one of the highest observed for marsupials (h = 0.95, H-E = 0.82). Contrary to ecological studies, both genic and genotypic analyses reveal weak genetic structure of populations, where high levels of dispersal may be inferred up to 230 km. The movement of individuals was predominantly male-biased (average N(e)m = 22.61, average N(f)m = 2.73). However, neither sex showed significant isolation by distance. On a continental scale, there was strong genetic differentiation and phylogeographic distinction between southern (TAS, VIC and NSW) and northern (QLD) populations, indicating a current and/or historical restriction of gene flow. In addition, it is evident that northern populations are historically more recent, and were derived from a small number of southern founders. Phylogenetic comparisons between M. g. giganteus and M. g. tasmaniensis indicated that the current taxonomic status of these subspecies should be revised as there was a lack of genetic differentiation between the populations sampled.

AB We conducted phylogeographic analyses of Motacilla flava (Yellow Wagtail) and M. citreola (Citrine Wagtail). We analyzed mitochondrial DNA sequences from 167 M. flava specimens obtained from 17 localities throughout Eurasia and Alaska, and 38 specimens of M. citreola obtained from 7 Eurasian localities. Phylogenetic analysis revealed three clades within traditionally recognized M. flava: Europe and southwestern Asia, northeastern Eurasia, and southeastern Asia. Those groups should be considered species, because together they are not monophyletic, and are interspersed with M. citreola, M. cinerea, and M. alba. Motacilla citreola also is paraphyletic, consisting of two species-level groups. Northeastern and southeastern groups of M. flava each appear to be sister taxa to eastern and western groups of M. citreola, respectively. Together those four groups form a clade, whereas the western M. flava group is considerably more distant. Within each of the three groups of M. flava, and the two groups of M. citreola, little phylogeographic structure was detected. Signatures of past population expansion are evident for some populations of M. flava; expansion is more recent in Moscow, Kursk (western group), Yamal, and Anabar (northeastern group), and older in Tyva and Vyatka (western group). A history of population stability is inferred for the Yamal population of M. citreola. Nested-clade analyses detected contiguous range expansion for southeastern M. flava and restricted gene flow with isolation by distance for northeastern M. flava and eastern M. citreola.

AB Changes in the spring arrival dates of migrant birds, particularly passerines, have been -reported from a range of locations. In this paper we take the opportunity provided by a -detailed monitoring scheme to examine several features of the timing and arrival pattern of White Storks (Ciconia ciconia) in Poznan province, western Poland during the period 1983 - 2002. In doing so, we address several criticisms associated with the use of first -arrival dates. We found no evidence of a weekend bias to phenological recording and, unlike in some other species, found no effect of population size on recorded arrival date. Some aspects of the arrival pattern got earlier over time and first arrival appears to have been about 10 days earlier in the last 20 years than in the previous century. Earlier arrival was associated with warmer spring weather and with a protracted arrival period. From our experience with this study, we suggest how the general public can be used to collect high quality phenological data.

AB To determine the degree of completion of Western Palaearctic dung beetle species inventory, as well as to ascertain some of the main geographical and morphological characteristics associated with the probability of new species description, the available taxonomic and biogeographic information of the three Scarabaeoidea families that are associated with dung was analyzed. An asymptotic fit of the cumulative number of described species is used to estimate the approximate number of species not yet described. Variation partitioning and hierarchical decomposition techniques were used to explore the influence of body size, geographical range size and geographical location variables on the process of species description. Results indicate that the inventories of Western Palaearctic Scarabaeidae and Geotrupidae species are almost complete, but that around 16% of Aphodiidae species have yet to be described. As the joint effect of geographical distribution and location is the main determinant of the species description rate in this family, it was predicted that new dung beetle species would be found in smaller areas of the southern and eastern Western Palaearctic region. The species body size accounted for a negligible fraction in the variation of the year of description. Both the geographical range size and the geographical location are essential variables negatively correlated with the year of species description, whose pure and combined effect can account for high percentages in the year of description variation (from 41 to 56%). The location of most of the taxonomic workforce in areas where broader-ranged generalist species prevail in the assemblages is the probable reason for this pattern.

AB We used whole-tree, open-top chambers to expose 13-year-old loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) trees, growing in soil with high or low nutrient availability, to either ambient or elevated (ambient + 200 mumol mol(-1)) carbon dioxide concentration ([CO2]) for 28 months. Branch growth and morphology, foliar chemistry and gas exchange characteristics were measured periodically in the upper, middle and lower crown during the 2 years of exposure. Fertilization and elevated [CO2] increased branch leaf area by 38 and 13%, respectively, and the combined effects were additive. Fertilization and elevated [CO2] differentially altered needle lengths, number of fascicles and flush length such that flush density (leaf area/flush length) increased with improved nutrition but decreased in response to elevated [CO2]. These results suggest that changes in nitrogen availability and atmospheric [CO2] may alter canopy structure, resulting in greater foliage retention and deeper crowns in loblolly pine forests. Fertilization increased foliar nitrogen concentration (N-M), but had no consistent effect on foliar leaf mass (W-A) or light-saturated net photosynthesis (As,,). However, the correlation between A(sat) and leaf nitrogen per unit area (N-A = WANM) ranged from strong to weak depending on the time of year, possibly reflecting seasonal shifts in the form and pools of leaf nitrogen. Elevated [CO2] had no effect on W-A, N-M or N-A, but increased A,,, on average by 82%. Elevated [CO2] also increased photosynthetic quantum efficiency and lowered the light compensation point, but had no effect on the photosynthetic response to intercellular [CO2], hence there was no acclimation to elevated [CO2]. Daily photosynthetic photon flux density at the upper, middle and lower canopy position was 60, 54 and 33%, respectively, of full sun incident to the top of the canopy. Despite the relatively high light penetration, WA, NA, A(sat) and R-d decreased with crown depth. Although growth enhancement in response to elevated [CO2] was dependent on fertilization, [CO2] by fertilization interactions and treatment by canopy position interactions generally had little effect on the physiological parameters measured.

AB Female mating with multiple males within a single fertile period is a common phenomenon in the animal kingdom. Female insects are particularly promiscuous. It is not clear why females mate with multiple partners despite several potential costs, such as expenditure of time and energy, reduced lifespan, risk of predation and contracting sexually transmitted diseases. Female red flour beetles (Tribolium castaneum) obtain sufficient sperm from a single insemination to retain fertility for several months. Nonetheless they copulate repeatedly within minutes with different males despite no direct fitness benefits from this behaviour. One hypothesis is that females mate with multiple partners to provide indirect benefits via enhanced offspring fitness. To test this hypothesis, we compared the relative fitness of F-1 offspring from females mated with single males and multiple males (2, 4, 8, or 16 partners), under the condition of relatively high intraspecific competition. We found that a female mating with 16 males enhanced the relative fitness of F-1 males (in two out of three trials) but reduced F-1 females' fitness (in two independent trials) in comparison with singly mated females. We also determined whether several important fitness correlates were affected by polyandry. We found that F-1 males from mothers with 16 partners inseminated more females than F-1 males from mothers with a single partner. The viability of the eggs sired or produced by F-1 males and females from highly polyandrous mothers was also increased under conditions of low intraspecific competition. Thus, the effects of polyandry on F-1 offspring fitness depend on environmental conditions. Our results demonstrated a fitness trade-off between male and female offspring from polyandrous mothers in a competitive environment. The mechanisms and biological significance of this unique phenomenon are discussed.

ID ROADS; FRAGMENTATION
AB Although many roadless areas on federal lands have been mapped in the United States since the 1970s, there has been little specific research on how and to what degree roadless areas contribute to biodiversity conservation, We examined the ecological attributes of mapped roadless areas for the Klamath-Siskiyou ecoregion of northwestern California and southwestern Oregon (U.S.A.). Attributes examined include special elements (such as natural heritage, serpentine geology, late-seral forests, Port Orford cedar [Chamaecyparis lawsoniana]), and key watersheds; elevation and habitat representation; and overall landscape connectivity. We compared designated wilderness to roadless areas, giving special attention to the relative importance of small roadless areas (405-2024 ba). We mapped nearly 500 roadless areas of greater than or equal to 405 ha. Roadless areas occupied more than twice the land area of wilderness (approximately 27% of the entire ecoregion) and contained approximately 36% of the known occurrences of heritage elements, 37% of the mapped serpentine habitats, 36% of the remaining late-seral forests, 60% of Port Orford cedar strongholds,, and 42% of key watersheds for aquatic biodiversity. In addition, roadless areas were composed of significant amounts of low- and mid-elevation sites and a substantial number of the 214 mapped physical-biological habitat types with strong complementarity with designated wilderness. Fragmentation analyses showed that roadless areas contributed to regional connectivity in important ways. Also, small roadless areas were an important component of the roadless-areas conservation assessment. For the Klamath-Siskiyou ecoregion, roadless areas and designated wilderness provide an important foundation upon which to develop a comprehensive regional conservation strategy.

AB Our study of the genetic structure of Mazzaella laminarioides (Bory) Fredericq (Gigartinales) in the central Chilean region documented a high level of genetic diversity based on random amplified polyp morphic DNA (RA-PD) markers and indicated the occurrence of significant genetic structure at different spatial scales. A total of 288 haploid gametophytes was analyzed with 17 polymorphic RAPD bands, which produced 202 distinct multilocus genotypes. Within stands, mean gene diversity ranged from 0.210 to 0.249 and no significant linkage disequilibrium could be detected among pairs of alleles, revealing that recombination (sexual reproduction) regularly shuffles the genes at that scale. Analysis of molecular variance within stands (less than 30 in) showed that the structure was very low, only marginally significant, and did not increase with increasing hierarchical levels at this lowest spatial scale. In contrast, at a larger spatial scale (among stands, from 5 to 60 km), increasing geographical distance seemed to account for increasing isolation between populations even if natural barriers, such as sandy beaches or river estuaries, may play a role in such isolation. Moreover, the strong genetic differentiation occurring between locations separated by 60 kin allowed the assignment of individuals to their original population through a canonical discriminant analysis. This approach further allowed the identification of potential recent migrants from one population to the other. Thus, in species like M. laminarioides for which the dominance of RAPD markers can be avoided by selecting haploid individuals, RAPD analysis appeared to be specially appropriate for the study of genetic differentiation.

AB Molecular and morphological phylogenetic studies in the Laurales have found that Hernandiaceae, Lauraceae, and Monimiaceae sensu stricto form a monophyletic group. Because of the paucity of phylogenetically informative substitutions, however, relationships among families within this clade remain unclear. In general, molecular phylogenies may conflict because of a variety of factors, including substitution rate variation among sites and lineages, taxon sampling, outgroup choice, and base compositional biases. We analyzed a total of 2846 aligned nucleotides from a plastid intron, three spacers, and a portion of the nuclear 26S rRNA gene in a sample of Hernandiaceae, Lauraceae, and Monimiaceae; we used four outgroups with differing substitution rates. Despite obtaining single best topologies with maximum likelihood, minimum evolution, and parsimony approaches, family relationships remained as poorly supported as they were in the previous molecular studies. Exploration of the data indicates that varying substitution rates across lineages or sites, insufficient taxon sampling, fast-evolving outgroups, or biased base composition are unlikely to explain the difficult reconstruction. Exclusion of some of the longest branched taxa (the hemiparasite Cassytha, selected Hernandiaceae, and two of the four outgroups) had no effect on topologies. To resolve relationships among the three families one could now complement existing five-gene data sets by adding the basal genera of Lauraceae, Monimiaceae, and Hernandiaceae, which are newly sampled here, or, our preferred strategy, by sequencing low-copy nuclear genes for the key genera to obtain different kinds of data.

   RELATIONS
AB Shallow-rooted white clover can be exposed to severe water stress during dry periods, leading to poor growth and persistence in pastures, Root growth is a primary determinant of drought tolerance and water uptake in dry soils, which may interact with P supply and defoliation Frequency for grazed white clover in legume-based pastures. Effects of four levels of P supply (0, 17, 50, and 150 mg P kg(-1) soil), two defoliation frequencies (frequent and infrequent), and two soil water regimes (wet and dry) were determined on various parameters associated with root growth and plant water uptake. A microscopy study was also undertaken to measure the relative size and abundance of xylem vessels in the primary roots of frequently defoliated low (P-0) and high P (P-150) plants. Increased P supply increased the rate of water loss per pot, which was better related to the coarse root length density compared with the fine root length density in dry soil. Coarse root length density, leaf area, mean number and diameter of xylem vessels, and potential root hydraulic conductance increased 6,2-, 12.4-, 2.4-, 1.5-, and 12.7-fold, respectively, for the frequently defoliated plants in dry soil between P-0 and P-150 treatments. It also appeared that leaf area and rate of water loss were dependent on the mean xylem diameter and associated hydraulic conductance. Increased P supply improved the ability of frequently defoliated white clover plants to tolerate dry soil conditions by lowering the resistance to water now in roots and increasing the water uptake.

AB By using degenerate oligonucleotides based on the sequence homology between known MutS homologues, three MSH cDNAs belonging to the MSH2, MSH3 and MSH6 families, as defined in eukaryotes, have been isolated from Arabidopsis thaliana (ecotype Columbia). Genomic sequences for two of these genes (AtMSH2 and AtMSH6-2) were also isolated and determined, whereas the genomic sequence of AtMSH3 was obtained through the Al arabidopsis sequencing project, as was the sequence of a second, distinct AtMSH6 homologue (AtMSH6-1). Comparative analysis of the AtMSH2 Landsberg erecta genomic sequence (reported here) and the previously described AtMSH2 Columbia allele revealed several polymorphisms, including the presence of a small, transposon-like element in the 3' untranscribed region of the former allele. Arabidopsis is the first organism to show such divergence of two AtMSH6 genes; the divergence is strongly supported by sequence data and phylogenetic analysis. Southern analysis revealed that the three genes we have isolated exist as single copies, and genetic mapping indicated that AtMSH2 and AtMSH6-2 both reside on chromosome III. Finally, expression of these three genes could only be observed in suspensions of A. thaliana cells. Such a cell suspension divides actively after subculture, and the AtMSH genes are most strongly expressed at this stage.

AB The hummingbird genus Metallura comprises nine species. Six of them live at the treeline and replace each other sharply along the eastern slope of the tropical Andes (williami, baroni, odomae, theresiae, eupogon, and aeneocauda). Their ranges overlap for 3,000 km along the Andes with M. tyrianthina, which lives at lower elevations and is differentiated into several subspecies that show clinal variation. The genus also includes M, phoebe in semiarid western Peru and M. iracunda in the Perija Mountains of the northern Andes. The group could be a good model to study relative differences in diversification between montane forest as such and the narrow transition zone toward the barren highlands. Analysis of nucleotide sequences from three different mitochondrial gene fragments (cytochrome b, ND2, and ND5) show that Metallura forms a monophyletic group whose sister taxon is the genus Chalcostigma. The treeline forms of Metallura, including the morphologically divergent M. phoebe group in a clade sister to M. tyrianthina, confirming the idea that montane forest and treeline forms are sister taxa in a strict sense. Neighboring treeline species show greater morphological and genetic differentiation relative to neighboring montane forest forms. The split between mid-elevation and treeline forms is estimated to have occurred during the Pliocene, suggesting that much of the Metallura radiation took place during the Pleistocene.

AB To investigate the phylogenetic relationships and geographical structure among landlocked populations of the black mudfish, Neochanna diversus, mitochondrial DNA nucleotide sequence data were sampled from seven populations from the Waikato and Northland regions of New Zealand. The complete D-loop region was sequenced from 70 individuals, with 913 bp from the tRNA-pro end used in population and phylogenetic analysis. A tandem repeat array, which ranged in size up to 200 bp, was found in most populations at the 3' end of the D-loop that was not able to be aligned for analysis. Of the seven sites sampled, two from Northland exhibited significant sequence divergence from all other sites. There was also a clear distinction among remaining Northland sites and those from the Waikato. An additional 518 bp segment of the 16S region was sequenced from all sites and compared with the other New Zealand mudfish species, N. apoda, N. burrowsius and the Tasmanian mudfish Galaxias (Neochanna) cleaveri using Galaxias maculatus as an outgroup. Both D-loop and 16S sequence data provided strong evidence for a cryptic species of mudfish present in Northland. The significant genetic structure apparent in the black mudfish appears most probably to be attributed to geological conditions during the Pliocene, where peat wetlands became apparent in the Waikato while Northland consisted of disjunct 'islands'. Conservation and management of these populations must take into account the historical processes that have shaped these patterns of genetic diversity.

AB 1. We report changes in photosynthetic capacity of leaves developed in varying photon flux density (PFD), nitrogen supply and CO2 concentration. We determined the relative effect of these environmental factors on photosynthetic capacity per unit leaf volume as well as the volume of tissue per unit leaf area. We calculated resource-use efficiencies from the photosynthetic capacities and measurements of leaf dry mass, carbohydrates and nitrogen content.
   2. There were clear differences between the mechanisms of photosynthetic acclimation to PFD, nitrogen supply and CO2. PFD primarily affected volume of tissue per unit area whereas nitrogen supply primarily affected photosynthetic capacity per unit volume. CO2 concentration affected both of these parameters and interacted strongly with the PFD and nitrogen treatments.
   3. Photosynthetic capacity per unit carbon invested in leaves increased in the low PFD, high nitrogen and low CO2 treatments. Photosynthetic capacity per unit nitrogen was significantly affected only by nitrogen supply.
   4. The responses to low PFD and low nitrogen appear to function to increase the efficiency of utilization of the limiting resource. However, the responses to elevated CO2 in the high PFD and high nitrogen treatments suggest that high CO2 can result in a situation where growth is not limited by either carbon or nitrogen supply. Limitation of growth at elevated CO2 appears to result from internal plant factors that limit utilization of carbohydrates at sinks and/or transport of carbohydrates to sinks.

AB Growth, shoot water relations and root hydraulic conductivity were studied in tomato plants (Lycopersicon esculentum cv. INCA9) subjected to different salt concentrations in the root medium. Two experiments were carried out at Institute Nacional de Ciencias Agricolas (INCA), Cuba, during May and June 1995. In the first experiment, plants were grown for 13 days in a nutrient solution with 0 or 100 mM NaCl. In the second experiment, the hydraulic conductivity was measured on roots submerged in nine different concentrations of NaCl up to 200 mM. The effect of temperature treatments between 0 and 50 degrees C on root hydraulic conductivity was also examined. Shoot growth, leaf water potential, leaf stomatal conductance, leaf relative water content and root hydraulic conductivity values decreased more rapidly in the treated plants than in control plants. A strong correlation was found between the root hydraulic conductivity and leaf water parameters, indicating that water flow through the roots was the main factor controlling shoot water relations.

AB The influence of sink development on the response of shoot growth in cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L. cv. Siokra BT1-4) was investigated by growing plants at three levels of CO2 concentration: 350 (ambient), 550 and 900 mu L L(-1) and six levels of nitrogen (N) supply ranging from deficient to excess (0-133 mg N kg(-1) soil week(-1)). Changes in leaf N concentration were also investigated. At 59 days after sowing, there was an average 63% increase in shoot growth at 550 mu L CO2 L(-1) compared with ambient CO2-grown plants, with no significant growth increase at 900 mu L CO2 L(-1) and, this response was closely matched by sink development (flower number and stem weight). Low N supply restricted the responses of both sink development and shoot growth to high CO2. At elevated CO2, leaf N concentration was reduced by an average 27% at low to adequate N supply. The high CO2-induced reduction in leaf N concentration, however, disappeared when the N supply was increased to a high level of 133 mg N kg(-1) soil week(-1). These CO2 effects on leaf N concentration were smaller when N was expressed per unit leaf area, apparently due to a combination of the effects of elevated CO2 or high N supply reducing specific leaf area and, to an N uptake limitation at low to moderate levels of N supply. The critical foliar N concentrations (leaf N concentration at 90% of maximum shoot growth) were reduced from 42 to 38 and 36 mg g(-1) when CO2 concentrations were increased from 350 to 550 and 900 mu L L(-1) respectively, indicating that changes in fertiliser management may be required under changing CO2 concentrations.

AB The aim of the work described in this paper was to calculate the fluxes of phosphate (P) across the intraradical interfaces between two vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi [Glomus mosseae (Nicol. and Gerd.) Gerdemann and Trappe and Glomus sp. 'City Beach' (WUM 16)] and Allium porrum L. The inflows of P into roots via the fungi were calculated from inflows into mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal plants for four harvest periods up to 84 d. The areas of interface between intercellular hyphae and roots, and arbuscules and roots were calculated for the same harvest periods using image analysis of sections in which the fungus was stained with nitroblue tetrazolium. The invagination of the arbuscular interface was calculated using methods based on previously published data. The fungi colonized the roots to approximately the same extent (% infection), but G. mosseae produced more intercellular hyphae and arbuscules, and hence larger interfacial areas than Glomus sp. City Beach (WUM 16).
   Hyphal inflows were higher for Glomus sp. City Beach (WUM 16) than G. mosseae for all except the last harvest period, but because of the lower interfacial areas, fluxes via this fungus were higher (3-7-12.8 nmol m(-2) s(-1)) than for G. mosseae (0-8-3-2 nmol m(-2) s(-1)). These fluxes are in the same range as values for P influx into plant cells and considerably larger than efflux from the fungal hyphae of ecto and ericoid mycorrhizal fungi measured in cultured mycelia. We conclude that enhanced efflux from the fungus must be essential for symbiotic phosphorus uptake by plants via VA mycorrhizal fungi.

TI INTERSPECIFIC COMPETITION - A MECHANISM FOR RODENT SUCCESSION AFTER FIRE
   IN WET HEATHLAND
SO AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID FIELD EXPERIMENTS; OVERLAP
AB A competitive interaction between two species of sympatric native rodents was demonstrated experimentally in Myall Lakes National Park (NSW, Australia). The previously documented replacement of Pseudomys gracilicaudatus by Rattus lutreolus in areas of wet heath in this region implied that competition may be the mechanism facilitating this succession. We present experimental evidence to support this suggestion. Removal of the larger R. lutreolus caused a significant increase in abundance of P. gracilicaudatus on five experimental sites in comparison to five unmanipulated control sites. The sites used in this experiment were chosen from three ages of wet heath regenerating after fire. These three ages represent key stages in the replacement of P. gracilicaudatus by R. lutreolus and the occurrence of competition in each of these ages indicates that competition plays an important role in this succession. In the initial stages of the experiment when R. lutreolus were removed they were replaced by new R. lutreolus individuals. This has been interpreted as evidence of strong intraspecific competition. After removal of R. lutreolus, P. gracilicaudatus expanded its habitat range into microhabitats that had formerly been occupied by R. lutreolus and reduced its range in microhabitats previously occupied by P. gracilicaudatus. This leads us to believe that P. gracilicaudatus was occupying inferior microhabitat before the removal of R. lutreolus, which had excluded it from more preferable microhabitat.

AB (1) Common frog, Rana temporaria, tadpoles inhibit the growth, prolong the development, and reduce the survival of natterjack toad, Bufo calamita, tadpoles. In a replicated pond experiment, B. calamita tadpoles treated with the faeces of R. temporaria tadpoles displayed growth inhibition. A unicellular organism was identified in tadpole faeces which is known to cause inhibition in laboratory cultures. (2) Overlap in the development periods of R. temporaria and B. calamita tadpoles is reduced when R. temporaria metamorphose before B. calamita. This subjects natterjacks to a steadily declining level of interspecific competition. Under such conditions, B. calamita tadpoles may be released from an initial period of growth inhibition, and metamorphose the same size as controls raised without R. temporaria. However, even with growth retrieval, time to metamorphosis and mortality are both increased relative to controls. (3) The effects of large R. temporaria tadpoles on B. calamita were not significantly different from those of small R. temporaria tadpoles. Large R. temporaria tadpoles metamorphosed before small R. temporaria tadpoles, thereby providing a longer retrieval period for inhibited B. calamita tadpoles. (4) When the breeding periods of R. temporaria and B. calamita are well-separated, temporal niche overlap between the tadpole stages will be reduced and growth inhibition ameliorated. However, such conditions may still prolong B. calamita development. Tadpoles may therefore be exposed to aquatic predators for longer, and incur a greater risk of dying as a result of pond desiccation.

AB Spawning and recruitment periodicity and post-recruitment mortality were investigated in the bluehead wrasse Thalassoma bifasciatum on fringing reefs on the west coast of Barbados by direct census and by otolith dating techniques. Spawning was seasonal, occurring primarily between January and August. Recruitment was seasonal, and was significantly correlated with spawning with time lags of 1 and 2 mo. This is consistent with the 45 d (range 33 to 64 d) larval life of T. bifasciatum, and suggests that seasonal variation in spawning is the principal factor driving seasonal variation in recruitment. Spawning frequency was higher around new and full moons (spring tides) than around first and last quarters (neap tides), but recruitment did not differ significantly with lunar phase. Daily spawning was more frequent during ebb tides than flood tides, with peak spawning occurring near the beginning of ebb tide. Surface currents on the study reefs were offshore on 96 % of the 94 occasions monitored, regardless of tidal phase. Surface currents at ebb tide were faster than at flood tide, and ebb tide currents were faster during spring tides than neap tides. The data suggest that both daily and lunar spawning cycles are influenced by daily and lunar variation in the speed of offshore currents. Population densities on all reefs had returned to pre-recruitment levels within 3 mo of the end of seasonal recruitment. Monthly mortality (% dying per month) on each study reef during the post-recruitment period was correlated with population density on that reef at the start of the month. This may suggest that post-recruitment mortality is density-dependent, but it could result from the covariance of density with age. However, the mean monthly mortality rate over the post-recruitment period on each reef was significantly correlated with recruitment strength to that reef. This suggests that post-recruitment mortality is density-dependent, and hence that post-recruitment processes influence the population dynamics of bluehead wrasse in Barbados.

AB Although interactions between plants and microbes at the plant-soil interface are known to be important for plant nutrient acquisition, relatively little is known about how root exudates contribute to nutrient exchange over the course of plant development. In this study, root exudates from slow- and fast-growing stages of Arabidopsis thaliana plants were collected, chemically analysed and then applied to a sandy nutrient-depleted soil. We then tracked the impacts of these exudates on soil bacterial communities, soil nutrients (ammonium, nitrate, available phosphorus and potassium) and plant growth. Both pools of exudates shifted bacterial community structure. GeoChip analyses revealed increases in the functional gene potential of both exudate-treated soils, with similar responses observed for slow-growing and fast-growing plant exudate treatments. The fast-growing stage root exudates induced higher nutrient mineralization and enhanced plant growth as compared to treatments with slow-growing stage exudates and the control. These results suggest that plants may adjust their exudation patterns over the course of their different growth phases to help tailor microbial recruitment to meet increased nutrient demands during periods demanding faster growth.

AB The vast boreal biome plays an important role in the global carbon cycle but is experiencing particularly rapid climate warming, threatening the integrity of valued ecosystems and their component species. We developed a framework and taxonomy to identify climate-change refugia potential in the North American boreal region, summarizing current knowledge regarding mechanisms, geographic distribution, and landscape indicators. While "terrain-mediated" refugia will mostly be limited to coastal and mountain regions, the ecological inertia (resistance to external fluctuations) contained in some boreal ecosystems may provide more extensive buffering against climate change, resulting in "ecosystem-protected" refugia. A notable example is boreal peatlands, which can retain high surface soil moisture and water tables even in the face of drought. Refugia from wildfire are also especially important in the boreal region, which is characterized by active disturbance regimes. Our framework will help identify areas of high refugia potential, and inform ecosystem management and conservation planning in light of climate change.

TI Do traits and phylogeny support congruent community diversity patterns

AB 1. It is now commonplace in community ecology to assess patterns of phylogenetic or functional diversity in order to inform our understanding of the assembly mechanisms that structure communities. While both phylogenetic and functional approaches have been used in conceptually similar ways, it is not clear if they both in fact reveal similar community diversity patterns or support similar inferences. We review studies that use both measures to determine the degree to which they support congruent patterns and inferences about communities.
   2. We performed a literature review with 188 analyses from 79 published papers that compared some facet of phylogenetic (PD) and functional diversity (FD) in community ecology. These studies generally report four main cases in which phylogenetic and functional information are used together in community analyses, to determine if: (a) there were phylogenetic signals in the measured traits in communities; (b) PD and FD were correlated with one another; (c) standardized PD and FD measures similarly revealed patterns of community over- or under-dispersion; and (d) PD and FD were both related to other explanatory variables (e.g. elevation) similarly.
   3. We found that the vast majority of studies found both strong phylogenetic signals in their traits and positive correlations of PD and FD measures across sites. However, and surprisingly, we found substantial incongruencies for the other tests. Phylogenetic and functional dispersion patterns were congruent only about half the time. Specifically, when communities were phylogenetically over-dispersed, these same communities were more likely to be functionally under-dispersed. Similarly, we found that phylogenetic and functional relationships with independent predictors were incongruent in about half of the analyses.
   4. Synthesis. Phylogenetic signal tests and PD-FD correlations appear to strongly support the congruence between traits and phylogeny. It is surprising that strong phylogenetic signals appeared so ubiquitous given that ecological studies often analyse phylogenetically incomplete sets of species that have undergone ecological sorting. Despite the largely congruent findings based on phylogenetic signal tests and PD-FD correlations, we found substantial incongruencies when researchers assessed either dispersion patterns or relationships with independent predictors. We discuss a number of potential ecological, evolutionary and methodological reasons for these incongruencies. Phylogenetic and functional information might reflect species ecological differences unequally with phylogenies better reflecting multivariate conserved elements of ecological similarity, and single traits better able to capture recent divergence, and both elements influence ecological patterns.

AB The bacterial community from estuarine sediment undertakes the bioremediation and energy transformation of anthropogenic pollutants especially polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). However, information and studies on bacterial synergism and related metabolic profiles under the stress of PAHs are limited. In this study, sediments from estuarine were collected and co-incubated with a classical PAH, pyrene. The results showed that Alpha- and Gammaproteobacteria became abundant at the late domesticating phase with the dominant genus of ZD0117, the uncultivated bacteria affiliated into Gammaproteobacteria. Functional gene analysis based on metagenomic sequencing showed that quantitatively changes of genes directly related to the degradation of aromatic hydrocarbon coordinated with genes involved into various metabolic pathways such as acylglycerol degradation, nitrogen fixation, sulfate transport system, Arnon-Buchanan cycle, and Calvin cycle (P < 0.01 and vertical bar rho vertical bar > 0.8). Fifty-six metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) were reconstructed, which were primarily composed by Alpha- and Gammaproteobacteria. Bacteria belonging to the phylum Proteobacteria were found to be abundant in MAGs and contained genes encoding for dehydrogenase, which are key enzymes for pyrene degradation. In addition, genomes of uncultivated bacteria were successfully reconstructed and were proven to carry genes of synergistically metabolizing pyrene. Based on analysis of typical MAGs, the metabolic pathways involved in syntrophic associations of a pyrene-degrading consortium were reconstructed. The results in this study could make us fully understand the metabolic patterns of pyrene-degrading consortium from the estuarine sediment and widen the scope of functional bacteria.

AB Given anticipated climate changes, it is crucial to understand controls on leaf temperatures including variation between species in diverse ecosystems. In the first study of leaf energy balance in tropical montane forests, we observed current leaf temperature patterns on 3 tree species in the Atlantic forest, Brazil, over a 10-day period and assessed whether and why patterns may vary among species. We found large leaf-to-air temperature differences (maximum 18.3 degrees C) and high leaf temperatures (over 35 degrees C) despite much lower air temperatures (maximum 22 degrees C). Leaf-to-air temperature differences were influenced strongly by radiation, whereas leaf temperatures were also influenced by air temperature. Leaf energy balance modelling informed by our measurements showed that observed differences in leaf temperature between 2 species were due to variation in leaf width and stomatal conductance. The results suggest a trade-off between water use and leaf thermoregulation; Miconia cabussu has more conservative water use compared with Alchornea triplinervia due to lower transpiration under high vapour pressure deficit, with the consequence of higher leaf temperatures under thermal stress conditions. We highlight the importance of leaf functional traits for leaf thermoregulation and also note that the high radiation levels that occur in montane forests may exacerbate the threat from increasing air temperatures.

AB Fuel, aridity, and ignition switches were all on in 2017, making it one of the largest and costliest wildfire years in the United States (U.S.) since national reporting began. Anthropogenic climate change helped flip on some of these switches rapidly in 2017, and kept them on for longer than usual. Anthropogenic changes to the fire environment will increase the likelihood of such record wildfire years in the coming decades. The 2017 wildfires in the U.S. constitute part of a shifting baseline in risks and costs; meanwhile, effective policies have lagged behind, leaving communities highly vulnerable. Policy efforts to build better and burn better, in the U.S. as well as in other nations with flammable ecosystems, will promote adaptation to increasing wildfire in a warming world.

AB Karst rocky desertification (KRD) is a process of land degradation, which causes desert like landscapes, deconstruction of endemic biomass, and declined soil quality. The relationship of KRD progression with above-ground communities (e.g. vegetation and animal) is well-studied. Interaction of soil desertification with underground communities, such as soil microbiome, however, is vastly unknown. This study characterizes change in soil bacterial community in response to KRD progression. Soil bacterial communities were surveyed by deep sequencing of 16S amplicons. Eight soil properties, pH, soil organic matter (SOM), total and available nitrogen (TN and AN), total and available phosphorus (TP and AP), and total and available potassium (TK and AK), were measured to assess soil quality. We find that the overall soil quality decreases along with KRD progressive gradient. Soil bacterial community compositions are distinguishingly different in KRD stages. The richness and diversity in bacterial community do not significantly change with KRD progression although a slight increase in diversity was observed. A slight decrease in richness was seen in SKRD areas. Soil pH primarily correlates with bacterial community composition. We identified a core microbiome for KRD soils consisting of; Acidobacteria, Alpha-Proteobacteria, Planctomycetes, Beta-Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, Delta-Proteobacteria, Chloroflexi, Bacteroidetes, Nitrospirae, and Gemmatimonadetes in this study. Phylum Cyanobacteria is significantly abundant in non-degraded soils, suggesting that Cyanobacterial activities might be correlated to soil quality. Our results suggest that Proteobacteria are sensitive to changes in soil properties caused by the KRD progression. Alpha- and beta-Proteobacteria significantly predominated in SKRD compared to NKRD, suggesting that Proteobacteria, along with many others in the core microbiome (Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, and Nitrospirae), were active in nutrient limiting degraded soils. This study demonstrates the relationship of soil properties with bacterial community in KRD areas. Our results fill the gap of knowledge on change in soil bacterial community during KRD progression.

AB Roots play a pivotal role in defining plant ecological success and mediating terrestrial ecosystem functioning. However, roots are difficult to study as they are hidden in the soil matrix and express a plurality of forms and functions: nutrient acquisition, anchorage, nutrient and water transport.
   In this special issue, we gather 20 articles from emerging topics in root ecology. We specifically focus on five frontiers that are essential to better capture plant, soil and ecosystem processes: (1) root structure and soil resource acquisition; (2) root dynamics; (3) root-root interactions; (4) root-microbe interactions and (5) the effects of roots on soil properties. For each of these sections we provide an overview of our current knowledge, highlight the contributions of this special issue, and pinpoint key remaining challenges for future work.
   Root resource acquisition, root dynamics, root-root and root-microbes interaction and the relative importance of root vs. soil properties on soil aggregation were shown to vary among biomes, soil and climate conditions. Such variability gives a complex but realistic picture of root functioning in real ecosystems and lays an important foundation for future work identify broad patterns of root functioning.

AB The use of functional traits to describe community structure is a promising approach to reveal generalities across organisms and ecosystems. Plant ecologists have demonstrated the importance of traits in explaining community structure, competitive interactions as well as ecosystem functioning. The application of trait-based methods to more complex communities such as food webs is however more challenging owing to the diversity of animal characteristics and of interactions. The objective of this study was to determine how functional structure is related to food web structure. We consider that food web structure is the result of 1) the match between consumer and resource traits, which determine the occurence of a trophic interaction between them, and 2) the distribution of functional traits in the community. We implemented a statistical approach to assess whether or not 35 466 pairwise interactions between soil organisms are constrained by trait-matching and then used a Procrustes analysis to investigate correlations between functional indices and network properties across 48 sites. We found that the occurrence of trophic interactions is well predicted by matching the traits of the resource with those of the consumer. Taxonomy and body mass of both species were the most important traits for the determination of an interaction. As a consequence, functional evenness and the variance of certain traits in the community were correlated to trophic complementarity between species, while trait identity, more than diversity, was related to network topology. The analysis was however limited by trait data availability, and a coarse resolution of certain taxonomic groups in our dataset. These limitations explain the importance of taxonomy, as well as the complexity of the statistical model needed. Our results outline the important implications of trait composition on ecological networks, opening promising avenues of research into the relationship between functional diversity and ecosystem functioning in multi-trophic systems.

AB Some microbial public goods can provide both individual and community-wide benefits, and are open to exploitation by non-producing species. One such example is the production of metal-detoxifying siderophores. Here, we investigate whether conflicting selection pressures on siderophore production by heavy metals - a detoxifying effect of siderophores, and exploitation of this detoxifying effect - result in a net increase or decrease. We show that the proportion of siderophore-producing taxa increases along a natural heavy metal gradient. A causal link between metal contamination and siderophore production was subsequently demonstrated in a microcosm experiment in compost, in which we observed changes in community composition towards taxa that produce relatively more siderophores following copper contamination. We confirmed the selective benefit of siderophores by showing that taxa producing large amounts of siderophore suffered less growth inhibition in toxic copper. Our results suggest that ecological selection will favour siderophore-mediated decontamination, with important consequences for potential remediation strategies.

AB In urban areas with a high level of human disturbance, wildlife has to adjust its behavior to deal with the so called "landscape of fear." This can be studied in risk perception during movement in relation to specific habitat types, whereby individuals trade-off between foraging and disturbance. Due to its high behavioral plasticity and increasing occurrence in urban environments, wild boar (Sus scrofa) is an excellent model organism to study adjustment to urbanization. With the help of GPS tracking, space use of 11 wild boar from Berlin's metropolitan region was analyzed: we aimed at understanding how animals adjust space use to deal with the landscape of fear in urban areas compared to rural areas. We compared use vs. availability with help of generalized linear mixed models. First, we studied landscape types selected by rural vs. urban wild boar, second, we analyzed distances of wild boar locations to each of the landscape types. Finally, we mapped the resulting habitat selection probability to predict hotspots of human-wildlife conflicts. A higher tolerance to disturbance in urban wild boar was shown by a one third shorter flight distance and by an increased re-use of areas close to the trap. Urban wild boar had a strong preference for natural landscapes such as swamp areas, green areas and deciduous forests, and areas with high primary productivity, as indicated by high NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index) values. The areas selected by urban wild boar were often located closely to roads and houses. The spatial distribution maps show that a large area of Berlin would be suitable for urban wild boar but not their rural conspecifics, with the most likely reason being a different perception of anthropogenic disturbance. Wild boar therefore showed considerable behavioral plasticity suitable to adjust to human-dominated environments in a potentially evolutionarily adaptive manner.

AB Wind erosion is a widespread environmental problem in the world's arid landscapes, which threatens the sustainability of ecosystem services in these regions.
   We investigated how wind erosion and key ecosystem services changed concurrently and what major biophysical and socioeconomic factors were responsible for these changes in a dryland area of China.
   Based on remote sensing data, field measurements, and modeling, we quantified the spatiotemporal patterns of both wind erosion and four key ecosystem services (soil conservation, crop production, meat production, and carbon storage) in the Mu Us Sandy Land in northern China during 2000-2013. Linear regression was used to explore possible relationships between wind erosion and ecosystem services.
   From 2000 to 2013, wind erosion decreased by as much as 60% and the four ecosystem services all increased substantially. These trends were attributable to vegetation recovery due mainly to government-aided ecological restoration projects and, to a lesser degree, slightly increasing precipitation and decreasing wind speed during the second half of the study period. The maximum soil loss dropped an order of magnitude when vegetation cover increased from 10% to 30%, halved again when vegetation increased from 30 to 40%, and showed little change when vegetation increased beyond 60%.
   Our study indicates that vegetation cover has nonlinear and threshold effects on wind erosion through constraining the maximum soil loss, which further affects dryland ecosystem services. These findings have important implications for ecological restoration and ecosystem management in dryland landscapes in China and beyond.

AB Biodiversity can buffer ecosystem functioning against extreme climatic events, but few experiments have explicitly tested this. Here, we present the first multisite biodiversityxdrought manipulation experiment to examine drought resistance and recovery at five temperate and Mediterranean grassland sites. Aboveground biomass production declined by 30% due to experimental drought (standardised local extremity by rainfall exclusion for 72-98 consecutive days). Species richness did not affect resistance but promoted recovery. Recovery was only positively affected by species richness in low-productive communities, with most diverse communities even showing overcompensation. This positive diversity effect could be linked to asynchrony of species responses. Our results suggest that a more context-dependent view considering the nature of the climatic disturbance as well as the productivity of the studied system will help identify under which circumstances biodiversity promotes drought resistance or recovery. Stability of biomass production can generally be expected to decrease with biodiversity loss and climate change.

AB Ecological niche modeling (ENM) is a broadly used tool in different fields of plant ecology. Despite the importance of edaphic conditions in determining the niche of terrestrial plant species, edaphic data have rarely been included in ENMs of plant species perhaps because such data are not available for many regions. Recently, edaphic data has been made available at a global scale allowing its potential inclusion and evaluation on ENM performance for plant species. Here, we take advantage of such data and address the following main questions: What is the influence of distinct predictor variables (e.g. climatic vs edaphic) on different ENM algorithms? and what is the relationship between the performance of different predictors and geographic characteristics of species? We used 125 plant species distributed over the Neotropical region to explore the effect on ENMs of using edaphic data available from the SoilGrids database and its combination with climatic data from the CHELSA database. In addition, we related these different predictor variables to geographic characteristics of the target species and different ENM algorithms. The use of different predictors (climatic, edaphic, and both) significantly affected model performance and spatial complexity of the predictions. We showed that the use of global edaphic plus climatic variables generates ENMs with similar or better accuracy compared to those constructed only with climate variables. Moreover, the performance of models considering these different predictors, separately or jointly, was related to geographic properties of species records, such as number and distribution range. The large geographic extent, the variability of environments and the different species' geographical characteristics considered here allowed us to demonstrate that global edaphic data adds useful information for plant ENMs. This is particularly valuable for studies of species that are distributed in regions where more detailed information on soil properties is poor or does not even exist.

AB Improving biodiversity predictions is essential if we are to meet the challenges posed by global change. As knowledge is key to feed models, we need to evaluate how debated theory can affect models. An important ongoing debate is whether environmental constraints limit the number of species that can coexist in a community (saturation), with recent findings suggesting that species richness in many communities might be unsaturated. Here, we propose that biodiversity models could address this issue by accounting for a duality: considering communities as unsaturated but where species composition is constrained by different scale-dependent biodiversity drivers. We identify a variety of promising advances for incorporating this duality into commonly applied biodiversity modelling approaches and improving their spatial predictions.

AB A number of devastating wildfires occurred in southeast Australia on 7 February 2009, colloquially known as Black Saturday. Atmospheric responses to this extreme fire event are investigated here with a focus on convective processes associated with fire activity (i.e., pyroconvection). We examine six different fire complexes on Black Saturday, finding three clearly distinct pyrocumulonimbus storms, the largest of which reached heights of 15 km on that day and generated hundreds of lightning strokes. The first lightning stroke was recorded near the largest fire complex 5 h after fire ignition. One of the pyrocumulonimbus storms was initiated close to midnight due to mesoscale influences, consistent with extreme fire behavior observed at that time for that particular fire. As another example of fire-atmosphere interactions, a fire that started late on Black Saturday is examined in relation to ignition caused by pyrogenic lightning, with implications for understanding the maximum rate of spread of a wildfire. Results are discussed in relation to another pyrocumulonimbus event associated with the 2003 Canberra fires. Our findings are intended to provide a greater understanding of pyroconvection and fire-atmosphere feedback processes, as well as help enhance wildfire response capabilities. We also demonstrate the potential for using lightning, radar, and satellite remote sensing in combination with thermodynamic analyses as well as synoptic and mesoscale dynamics to provide enhanced real-time guidance for dangerous fire conditions associated with pyroconvection, as well as for the risk of new fire ignitions from pyrogenic lightning.
   Plain Language Summary A number of devastating wildfires occurred in southeast Australia on 7 February 2009, colloquially known as Black Saturday. Atmospheric responses to this extreme fire event are investigated here with a focus on convective processes associated with fire activity (i.e., pyroconvection). We show that multiple fire plumes produced a number of distinct pyrocumulonimbus storms, some of which reached heights of 15 km on that day and generated a large amount of lightning. The first lightning stroke was recorded near the largest fire complex 5 h after fire ignition. This offers broad implications for understanding fire behavior exacerbation rates, given that deep convection can produce extreme variations in surface wind conditions. A fire that started late on Black Saturday is examined in relation to ignition caused by pyrogenic lightning, 100 km ahead of the fire front, with implications for understanding extreme fire spread rates. Our findings are intended to provide a greater understanding of pyroconvection and fire-atmosphere feedback processes, as well as help enhance wildfire response capabilities. We also demonstrate the potential for combining lightning and radar data to provide real-time guidance for dangerous fire conditions associated with pyroconvection, as well as for the risk of new fire ignitions from pyrogenic lightning.

AB Fire shapes biome distribution and community composition worldwide, and is extensively used as a management tool in flammable landscapes. There is growing concern, however, that fire could increase the vulnerability of native fauna to invasive predators. We developed a conceptual model of the ways in which fire could influence predator-prey dynamics. Using a before-after, control-impact experiment, we then investigated the short-term effects of a prescribed fire on 2 globally significant invasive mesopredators (red fox, Vulpes vulpes, and feral cat, Felis catus) and their native mammalian prey in a fire-prone forest of southeastern Australia. We deployed motion-sensing cameras to assess species occurrence, collected predator scats to quantify diet and prey choice, and measured vegetation cover before and after fire. We examined the effects of the fire at the scale of the burn block (1,190 ha), and compared burned forest to unburned refuges. Pre-fire, invasive predators and large native herbivores were more likely to occur at sites with an open understory, whereas the occurrence of most small- and medium-sized native mammals was positively associated with understory cover. Fire reduced understory cover by more than 80%, and resulted in a 5-fold increase in the occurrence of invasive predators. Concurrently, relative consumption of medium-sized native mammals by foxes doubled, and selection of long-nosed bandicoots (Perameles nasuta) and short-beaked echidnas (Tachyglossus aculeatus) by foxes increased. Occurrence of bush rats (Rattus fuscipes) declined. It was unclear if fire also affected the occurrence of bandicoots or echidnas, as changes coincided with normal seasonal variations. Overall, prescribed fire promoted invasive predators, while disadvantaging their medium-sized native mammalian prey. Further replication and longer-term experiments are needed before these findings can be generalized. Nonetheless, such interactions could pose a serious threat to vulnerable species such as critical weight range mammals. Integrated invasive predator and fire management are recommended to improve biodiversity conservation in flammable ecosystems.

AB In the face of climate change, predicting and understanding future fire regimes across Canada is a high priority for wildland fire research and management. Due in large part to the difficulties in obtaining future daily fire weather projections, one of the major challenges in predicting future fire activity is to estimate how much of the change in weather potential could translate into on-the-ground fire spread. As a result, past studies have used monthly, annual, or multi-decadal weather projections to predict future fires, thereby sacrificing information relevant to day-to-day fire spread. Using climate projections from the fifth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5), historical weather observations, MODIS fire detection data, and the national fire database of Canada, this study investigated potential changes in the number of active burning days of wildfires by relating 'spread days' to patterns of daily fire-conducive weather. Results suggest that climate change over the next century may have significant impacts on fire spread days in almost all parts of Canada's forested landmass; the number of fire spread days could experience a 2-to-3-fold increase under a high CO2 forcing scenario in eastern Canada, and a greater than 50% increase in western Canada, where the fire potential is already high. The change in future fire spread is critical in understanding fire regime changes, but is also imminently relevant to fire management operations and in fire risk mitigation.

AB Anthropogenic threats often impose strong selection on affected populations, causing rapid evolutionary responses. Unfortunately, these adaptive responses are rarely harnessed for conservation. We suggest that conservation managers pay close attention to adaptive processes and geographic variation, with an eye to using them for conservation goals. Translocating pre-adapted individuals into recipient populations is currently considered a potentially important management tool in the face of climate change. Targeted gene flow, which involves moving individuals with favorable traits to areas where these traits would have a conservation benefit, could have a much broader application in conservation. Across a species' range there may be long-standing geographic variation in traits or variation may have rapidly developed in response to a threatening process. Targeted gene flow could be used to promote natural resistance to threats to increase species resilience. We suggest that targeted gene flow is a currently underappreciated strategy in conservation that has applications ranging from the management of invasive species and their impacts to controlling the impact and virulence of pathogens.
   Los Efectos de la Resistencia de la Cuerda para Pescar sobre la Severidad de los Enredos de Ballenas Grandes Las amenazas antropogenicas frecuentemente imponen una seleccion fuerte sobre las poblaciones afectadas, lo que causa respuestas evolutivas rapidas. Desafortunadamente, estas respuestas adaptativas se usan rara vez para la conservacion. Sugerimos que los manejadores de la conservacion presten atencion cuidadosamente a los procesos adaptativos y a la variacion genica, con miras a usarlos para los objetivos de conservacion. Reubicar a individuos pre-adaptados a poblaciones receptoras actualmente se considera una herramienta de manejo potencialmente importante de frente al cambio climatico. El flujo genico dirigido, que involucra mover individuos con caracteres favorables a areas en las que estos caracteres se habrian considerado un beneficio, podria tener una aplicacion amplia en la conservacion. A lo largo de la extension de las especies puede haber una variacion geografica de larga duracion en los caracteres o la variacion podria haberse desarrollado rapidamente en respuesta a un proceso de amenaza. El flujo genico dirigido podria usarse para promover la resistencia natural a amenazas para asi incrementar la resiliencia de las especies. Sugerimos que el flujo genico dirigido es actualmente una estrategia poco apreciada en la conservacion y que tiene aplicaciones que van desde el manejo de las especies invasoras y sus impactos hasta el control del impacto y la virulencia de los patogenos.

AB Apomictic plants expand their geographical distributions more to higher elevations compared to their sexual progenitors. It was so far unclear whether this tendency is related to mode of reproduction itself or represents a side effect of polyploidy. Apomixis is advantageous for range expansions as no mating partners and pollinators are needed (Baker's rule). Polyploidy is thought to infer fitness advantages and a higher vigour that would enable plants to adjust better to more extreme climatic conditions. However, little is known about actual performance of plants at higher elevations. We analyzed 81 populations of Ranunculus kuepferi from the whole distribution area in the European Alps to quantify apomictic versus sexual seed formation via flow cytometric seed screening. Seed set and vegetative growth were measured as fitness parameters. All parameters were correlated to geographical distribution, elevation, temperature and precipitation. Flow cytometric seed screening revealed predominantly obligate sexuality (88.9 %) and facultative apomixis in diploid populations, while tetraploid populations are predominantly facultative (65.4%) to obligate apomictic. Apomictic seed formation correlated significantly to higher elevations, which explains also the observed niche shift to lower temperatures. However, within the tetraploid range, there is no apparent correlation of degree of facultative apomixis to geographical distance. Apomixis appeared in diploids three times independently in separated, otherwise sexual populations in the southwestern refugial areas of the Alps. Diploid apomixis was not successful in range expansions, and obligate sexual polyploids were not observed. Polyploidy may relate to cold tolerance as an adaptation to conditions at high elevations, where diploid sexuals have no fitness advantage. Instead, facultative apomixis may have aided colonization of higher elevations and range expansions in the Alps without mate and pollinator limitation, but did not necessarily involve long-distance dispersal. A direct influence of low temperatures on unreduced gamete formation cannot be ruled out.

AB AimPrescribed fire is a common land management for reducing risks from unplanned fires. However, the universality of such effectiveness remains uncertain due to biogeographical variation in fuel types, climatic influences and fire regimes. Here, we explore biogeographical patterns in the effectiveness of prescribed fire by calculating leverage (the reduction in unplanned area burnt resulting from recent previous area burnt) across south-eastern Australia over a 25year period.
   LocationThe 30 bioregions of south-eastern Australia.
   MethodsWe quantified leverage in each bioregion from fire records from 1975-2009, controlling for variation in annual weather. We also identified potential drivers of variation in leverage by relating the bioregional leverage values to measures of fuel type and growth, climate, and weather extremes.
   ResultsLeverage was inferred in four bioregions while in the other 26 bioregions no leverage was detected or prescribed fire had the opposite effect (fire-follows-fire). Leverage occurred in the forested eastern section of the study area, where rainfall, fuel load and fire activity is high and fire weather is mild. In all bioregions, weather was a stronger predictor than past-fire extent of area burnt in a particular year.
   Main conclusionsOur analysis of leverage shows that the effectiveness of prescribed fire varies regionally in predictable ways, which means that fuel management strategies applied in one region are not necessarily applicable in another. In most bioregions prescribed burning is likely to have very little effect on subsequent extent of unplanned fire, and even in regions where leverage occurs, large areas of treatment are required to substantially reduce the area burned by unplanned fire.

AB Habitat change and fragmentation are considered key drivers of environmental change and biodiversity loss. To understand and mitigate the effects of such spatial disturbances on biological systems, it is critical to quantify changes in landscape pattern. However, the characterization of spatial patterns remains complicated in part because most widely used landscape metrics vary with the amount of usable habitat available in the landscape, and vary with the scale of the spatial data used to calculate them. In this study, we investigate the nature of the relationship between intrinsic characteristics of spatial pattern and extrinsic scale-dependent factors that affect the characterization of landscape patterns. To do so, we used techniques from modern multivariate statistics to disentangle widely used landscape metrics with respect to four landscape components: extent (E), resolution (R), percentage of suitable habitat cover (P), and spatial autocorrelation level (H). Our results highlight those metrics that are less sensitive to change in spatial scale and those that are less correlated. We found, however, significant and complex interactions between intrinsic and extrinsic characteristics of landscape patterns that will always complicate researcher's ability to isolate purely landscape pattern driven effects from the effects of changing spatial scale. As such, our study illustrates the need for a more systematic investigation of the relationship between intrinsic characteristics and extrinsic properties to accurately characterize observed landscape patterns.

AB The utilization of species distribution model(s) (SDM) for approximating, explaining, and predicting changes in species' geographic locations is increasingly promoted for proactive ecological management. Although frameworks for modeling non-invasive species distributions are relatively well developed, their counterparts for invasive species-which may not be at equilibrium within recipient environments and often exhibit rapid transformations-are lacking. Additionally, adaptive ecological management strategies address the causes and effects of biological invasions and other complex issues in social-ecological systems. We conducted a review of biological invasions, species distribution models, and adaptive practices in ecological management, and developed a framework for adaptive, niche-based, invasive species distribution model (iSDM) development and utilization. This iterative, 10-step framework promotes consistency and transparency in iSDM development, allows for changes in invasive drivers and filters, integrates mechanistic and correlative modeling techniques, balances the avoidance of type 1 and type 2 errors in predictions, encourages the linking of monitoring and management actions, and facilitates incremental improvements in models and management across space, time, and institutional boundaries. These improvements are useful for advancing coordinated invasive species modeling, management and monitoring from local scales to the regional, continental and global scales at which biological invasions occur and harm native ecosystems and economies, as well as for anticipating and responding to biological invasions under continuing global change.

AB Tree species influence the litter decomposition process by influencing litter quality and soil microclimate. Furthermore, over the long term, trees could promote soil communities that are particularly capable of degrading the litter they encounter most often. Thus, plant litter could decompose faster when placed in the habitat from which it was derived than in a foreign habitat, which has been termed home field advantage (HFA) of litter decomposition. In mixed-plant species environments however, it is not known whether a specific decomposer community under one tree species is affected by the presence of another tree species in the vicinity. To address this question, we tested if spruce and poplar litters showed HFA in mono-specific and in mixed species plantations under each tree species by reciprocally transplanting litter in the two plantation types. Decomposition rates, as well as the composition and ability of decomposer communities to degrade the different types of litter, were monitored during two years. Only spruce litter exhibited a faster decomposition rate at home. This HFA could be explained by higher abundance of decomposers. Furthermore, cellulose and poplar litter decomposed less or similarly in spruce plantations, suggesting that soil communities of that environment were capable of specifically degrading spruce litter. In mixed plantations, HFA was in the same direction as in mono-specific plantations, but was not as strong, indicating that HFA is sensitive to the surrounding plant community. Furthermore, this "mixed environment" had synergistic effects on decomposition rates under poplar trees. These 'tree environment-specific' results highlighted the possible importance of spatial distribution of each litter on decomposition rates in mixed stands. Thus, the influence of litter dispersal should be taken into account in future studies.

AB Island endemics are typically differentiated from their mainland progenitors in behavior, morphology, and genetics, often resulting from long-term evolutionary change. To examine mechanisms for the origins of island endemism, we present a phylogeographic analysis of whole mitochondrial genomes from the endangered island fox (Urocyon littoralis), endemic to California's Channel Islands, and mainland gray foxes (U. cinereoargenteus). Previous genetic studies suggested that foxes first appeared on the islands > 16,000 years ago, before human arrival (similar to 13,000 cal BP), while archaeological and paleontological data supported a colonization > 7000 cal BP. Our results are consistent with initial fox colonization of the northern islands probably by rafting or human introduction similar to 9200-7100 years ago, followed quickly by human translocation of foxes from the northern to southern Channel Islands. Mitogenomes indicate that island foxes are monophyletic and most closely related to gray foxes from northern California that likely experienced a Holocene climate-induced range shift. Our data document rapid morphological evolution of island foxes (in similar to 2000 years or less). Despite evidence for bottlenecks, island foxes have generated and maintained multiple mitochondrial haplotypes. This study highlights the intertwined evolutionary history of island foxes and humans, and illustrates a new approach for investigating the evolutionary histories of other island endemics.

AB In the face of growing human impacts on ecosystems, scientists and managers recognize the need to better understand thresholds and non-linear dynamics in ecological systems to help set management targets. However, our understanding of the factors that drive threshold dynamics, and when and how rapidly thresholds will be crossed is currently limited in many systems. In spite of these limitations, there are approaches available to practitioners today-including ecosystem monitoring, statistical methods to identify thresholds and indicators, and threshold-based adaptive management-that can be used to help avoid reaching ecological thresholds or restore systems that have crossed them. We briefly review the current state of knowledge and then use real-world examples to demonstrate how resource managers can use available approaches to avoid crossing ecological thresholds. We also highlight new tools and indicators being developed that have the potential to enhance our ability to detect change, predict when a system is approaching an ecological threshold, or restore systems that have already crossed a tipping point.

AB A growing body of evidence indicates that the environmental quality of residential neighbourhoods has an impact on their liveability. It can be a contributory factor to the prosperity and development of cities because it reflects the real-life experiences of residents and can also affect the attractiveness of a city for well-qualified workers. A liveable neighbourhood can help to improve the quality of life of residents, which is one of the determining factors in creating a socially sustainable urban environment. This research aimed to develop a practical method for assessing the liveability of a residential neighbourhood, tested in two contrasting countries, Iran and Estonia. We developed and tested a set of criteria based on the principles and attributes of liveability obtained from the literature and we used a Delphi survey of Iranian and Estonian urban planning and design experts to identify which of the candidate criteria were most appropriate to each country together with their priority weighting. The results showed that while many of the same criteria applied to both countries, the importance of them varied, in part reflecting environmental differences such as climate and day length. The method has potential for use in the development of indicators of liveability as part of urban sustainability assessment. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Cultural landscapes are priority research themes addressed in many fields of knowledge. Botanists can explore the ecological, formal and cognitive level of cultural landscapes with different approaches. Palynologists study both palaeoenvironmental (off-site) and archaeological (on-site) records and are, therefore, in a privileged corner to observe the origin and history of present landscapes, what is their true nature and vocation, what must be preserved or transformed for the future. The study of an archaeological site shows short space-time events and the behaviour of a few people. In order, though, to attain a regional and cross-area cultural landscape reconstruction, many sites must be studied as part of a regional multi-point site and with an interdisciplinary approach. The likelihood to observe human-induced environments in pollen diagrams depends on the nature and productivity of human-related plant species. In the Mediterranean area, many Palaeolithic, Mesolithic and Neolithic sites point to the long-term action on the environment. However, the pollen signal of pre-Holocene and early Holocene human impact is ambiguous or weak. The effects of culture became evident, and possibly irreversible, as a consequence of human permanence in a certain land. In the Bronze age, the establishment of human-induced environments was evident from the combination of decrease of forest cover and increase of cereal and synanthropic pollen types in pollen records.

AB Background: Chagas disease kills approximately 45 thousand people annually and affects 10 million people in Latin America and the southern United States. The parasite that causes the disease, Trypanosoma cruzi, can be transmitted by insects of the family Reduviidae, subfamily Triatominae. Any study that attempts to evaluate risk for Chagas disease must focus on the ecology and biogeography of these vectors. Expected distributional shifts of vector species due to climate change are likely to alter spatial patterns of risk of Chagas disease, presumably through northward expansion of high risk areas in North America.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: We forecast the future (2050) distributions in North America of Triatoma gerstaeckeri and T. sanguisuga, two of the most common triatomine species and important vectors of Trypanosoma cruzi in the southern United States. Our aim was to analyze how climate change might affect the future shift of Chagas disease in North America using a maximum entropy algorithm to predict changes in suitable habitat based on vector occurrence points and predictive environmental variables. Projections based on three different general circulation models (CCCMA, CSIRO, and HADCM3) and two IPCC scenarios (A2 and B2) were analyzed. Twenty models were developed for each case and evaluated via cross-validation. The final model averages result from all twenty of these models. All models had AUC >0.90, which indicates that the models are robust. Our results predict a potential northern shift in the distribution of T. gerstaeckeri and a northern and southern distributional shift of T. sanguisuga from its current range due to climate change.
   Conclusions/Significance: The results of this study provide baseline information for monitoring the northward shift of potential risk from Chagas disease in the face of climate change.

AB Background: For > 100 years cattle production in the southern United States has been threatened by cattle fever. It is caused by an invasive parasite-vector complex that includes the protozoan hemoparasites Babesia bovis and B. bigemina, which are transmitted among domestic cattle via Rhipicephalus tick vectors of the subgenus Boophilus. In 1906 an eradication effort was started and by 1943 Boophilus ticks had been confined to a narrow tick eradication quarantine area (TEQA) along the Texas-Mexico border. However, a dramatic increase in tick infestations in areas outside the TEQA over the last decade suggests these tick vectors may be poised to re-invade the southern United States. We investigated historical and potential future distributions of climatic habitats of cattle fever ticks to assess the potential for a range expansion.
   Methods: We built robust spatial predictions of habitat suitability for the vector species Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus and R. (B.) annulatus across the southern United States for three time periods: 1906, present day (2012), and 2050. We used analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) to identify persistent tick occurrences and analysis of bias in the climate proximate to these occurrences to identify key environmental parameters associated with the ecology of both species. We then used ecological niche modeling algorithms GARP and Maxent to construct models that related known occurrences of ticks in the TEQA during 2001-2011 with geospatial data layers that summarized important climate parameters at all three time periods.
   Results: We identified persistent tick infestations and specific climate parameters that appear to be drivers of ecological niches of the two tick species. Spatial models projected onto climate data representative of climate in 1906 reproduced historical pre-eradication tick distributions. Present-day predictions, although constrained to areas near the TEQA, extrapolated well onto climate projections for 2050.
   Conclusions: Our models indicate the potential for range expansion of climate suitable for survival of R. microplus and R. annulatus in the southern United States by mid-century, which increases the risk of reintroduction of these ticks and cattle tick fever into major cattle producing areas.

AB 1Understanding which environmental factors drive foraging preferences is critical for the development of effective management measures, but resource use patterns may emerge from processes that occur at different spatial and temporal scales. Direct observations of foraging are also especially challenging in marine predators, but passive acoustic techniques provide opportunities to study the behaviour of echolocating species over a range of scales. We used an extensive passive acoustic data set to investigate the distribution and temporal dynamics of foraging in bottlenose dolphins using the Moray Firth (Scotland, UK). Echolocation buzzes were identified with a mixture model of detected echolocation inter-click intervals and used as a proxy of foraging activity. A robust modelling approach accounting for autocorrelation in the data was then used to evaluate which environmental factors were associated with the observed dynamics at two different spatial and temporal scales. At a broad scale, foraging varied seasonally and was also affected by seabed slope and shelf-sea fronts. At a finer scale, we identified variation in seasonal use and local interactions with tidal processes. Foraging was best predicted at a daily scale, accounting for site specificity in the shape of the estimated relationships. This study demonstrates how passive acoustic data can be used to understand foraging ecology in echolocating species and provides a robust analytical procedure for describing spatio-temporal patterns. Associations between foraging and environmental characteristics varied according to spatial and temporal scale, highlighting the need for a multi-scale approach. Our results indicate that dolphins respond to coarser scale temporal dynamics, but have a detailed understanding of finer-scale spatial distribution of resources.

AB While demographic changes in short-lived species may be observed relatively quickly in response to climate changes, measuring population responses of long-lived species requires long-term studies that are not always available. We analyzed data from a population of threatened Agassiz's desert tortoises (Gopherus agassizii) at a 2.59 km(2) study plot in the Sonoran Desert ecosystem of Joshua Tree National Park, California, USA from 1978 to 2012 to examine variation in apparent survival and demography in this long-lived species. Transect-based, mark-recapture surveys were conducted in 10 of those years to locate living and dead tortoises. Previous modeling suggested that this area would become unsuitable as tortoise habitat under a warming and drying climate scenario. Estimated adult population size declined greatly from 1996 to 2012. The population appeared to have high apparent survival from 1978 to 1996 but apparent survival decreased from 1997 to 2002, concurrent with persistent drought. The best model relating apparent survivorship of tortoises >= 18 cm over time was based on a three year moving average of estimated winter precipitation. The postures and positions of a majority of dead tortoises found in 2012 were consistent with death by dehydration and starvation. Some live and many dead tortoises found in 2012 showed signs of predation or scavenging by mammalian carnivores. Coyote (Canis latrans) scats and other evidence from the site confirmed their role as tortoise predators and scavengers. Predation rates may be exacerbated by drought if carnivores switch from preferred mammalian prey to tortoises during dry years. Climate modeling suggests that the region will be subjected to even longer duration droughts in the future and that the plot may become unsuitable for continued tortoise survival. Our results showing wide fluctuations in apparent survival and decreasing tortoise density over time may be early signals of that possible outcome. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB We reconstructed the phylogeny of representatives from nine genera and three families of the Cymbellales using two nuclear and three chloroplast genes. After rooting with Anomoeoneis, Placoneis was found as sister to a clade composed of Cymbella, Cymbopleura, Encyonema, Gomphonema, and Gomphoneis. The latter group was divided into lineages with mainly heteropolar and dorsiventral valve symmetry. The data and chloroplast morphology also supported a close relationship between Geissleria decussis and Placoneis. Expectedly, the sequenced genes exhibited substantial across-site rate variation (ASRV) that prompted us to assess the stability of the inferred relationships in the face of different approaches for modelling ASRV. While the overall topology remained stable across analyses, relationships between Cymbella and Cymbopleura and within one clade of Gomphonema varied dependent on the employed model. In some cases a strongly supported relationship in one analysis was not recovered by another that differed solely in how the data were partitioned. These topological fluctuations appeared in areas of the tree with the least balanced taxon sampling, and they altered the outcomes of phylogenetic hypotheses tests of monophyly. Assessing how different models for ASRV affect tree topology and clade support values, therefore, seems important in cases of sparse or unbalanced taxon sampling or when assessing the phylogenetic affinity of previously unsampled taxa when lineage-specific biases in base composition or evolutionary rate are more difficult to detect.

AB Rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations are placing spatially divergent stresses on the world's tropical coral reefs through increasing ocean surface temperatures and ocean acidification. We show how these two stressors combine to alter the global habitat suitability for shallow coral reef ecosystems, using statistical Bioclimatic Envelope Models rather than basing projections on any a priori assumptions of physiological tolerances or fixed thresholds. We apply two different modeling approaches (Maximum Entropy and Boosted Regression Trees) with two levels of complexity (one a simplified and reduced environmental variable version of the other). Our models project a marked temperature-driven decline in habitat suitability for many of the most significant and bio-diverse tropical coral regions, particularly in the central Indo-Pacific. This is accompanied by a temperature-driven poleward range expansion of favorable conditions accelerating up to 40-70km per decade by 2070. We find that ocean acidification is less influential for determining future habitat suitability than warming, and its deleterious effects are centered evenly in both hemispheres between 5 degrees and 20 degrees latitude. Contrary to expectations, the combined impact of ocean surface temperature rise and acidification leads to little, if any, degradation in future habitat suitability across much of the Atlantic and areas currently considered marginal' for tropical corals, such as the eastern Equatorial Pacific. These results are consistent with fossil evidence of range expansions during past warm periods. In addition, the simplified models are particularly sensitive to short-term temperature variations and their projections correlate well with reported locations of bleaching events. Our approach offers new insights into the relative impact of two global environmental pressures associated with rising atmospheric CO2 on potential future habitats, but greater understanding of past and current controls on coral reef ecosystems is essential to their conservation and management under a changing climate.

AB The generation of heterogeneous fire mosaics is commonly advocated as a strategy for biodiversity conservation in flammable ecosystems, but it is usually unclear how mosaic properties link to biodiversity outcomes. Here we define a formal relationship between these elements and outline a method for determining the composition of fire mosaics defined by vegetation age classes that maximise species diversity. The method involves 1. quantifying species abundance in each of several previously defined vegetation age classes, and 2. using optimisation to determine the age class distribution that maximises species diversity. We applied the method to 135 species from four taxa in a southeastern Australian heathy woodland. In addition, we quantified the degree to which each taxa could act as a surrogate for others, and assessed how our chosen diversity metric changed with departures from the optimal distribution. Optimal age class distributions differed among taxa, and surrogacy relationships between most groups were poor. Departure from the optimal distribution resulted in an estimated decline in species diversity, a measure that may be used to quantify the biodiversity cost of alternative management strategies. Our measure of departure, relative entropy, was a strong predictor of diversity decline for some taxa but not for others. In cases where predictive capacity was strong, the rate of decline differed among groups. In flammable ecosystems our method can help determine fire management strategies empirically linked to a landscape-scale conservation objective. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Climate change is causing spatio-temporal shifts in environmental conditions, and species that are not able to track suitable environments may face increased risks of extinction. Assisted colonization, a form of translocation, has been proposed as a tool to help species survive the impacts of climate change. Unfortunately, translocations generally have a low success rate, a well-documented fact that is not considered in most of the recent literature on assisted colonization. One of the main impediments to translocation success is inadequate planning. In this review, we argue that by using well-known analytical tools such as species distribution models and population dynamics modelling we can maximize the success of assisted colonization. In particular, we present guidelines as to which questions should be investigated when planning assisted colonization and suggest methods for answering them. Finally, we also highlight further implementation and research issues that remain to be solved for assisted colonizations to be efficient climate change adaptation tools.

AB Ongoing warming at high latitudes is expected to lead to large changes in the structure and function of boreal forests. Our objective in this research is to determine the climatic controls over the growth of white spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss) at the warmest driest margins of its range in interior Alaska. We then use those relationships to determine the climate variables most likely to limit future growth. We collected tree cores from white spruce trees growing on steep, south-facing river bluffs at five sites in interior Alaska, and analyzed the relationship between ring widths and climate using boosted regression trees. Precipitation and temperature of the previous growing season are important controls over growth at most sites: trees grow best in the coolest, wettest years. We identify clear thresholds in growth response to a number of variables, including both temperature and precipitation variables. General circulation model (GCM) projections of future climate in this region suggest that optimum climatic conditions for white spruce growth will become increasingly rare in the future. This is likely to cause short-term declines in productivity and, over the longer term, probably lead to a contraction of white spruce to the cooler, moister parts of its range in Alaska.

AB This study developed species distribution models (SDMs) of the 6 dominant Hawaiian coral species (Montipora capitata, Montipora flabellata, Montipora patula, Pocillopora meandrina, Porites compressa, and Porites lobata) around the main Hawaiian Islands (MHI). To construct the SDMs, we used boosted regression tree (BRT) models to investigate relationships between the abundance (i.e. benthic cover) of each species with a set of environmental variables for the time period from 2000 to 2009. Mean significant wave height and maximum significant wave height were the most influential variables explaining coral abundance in the Hawaiian Islands. The BRT models also identified relationships between coral cover and island age, depth, downwelled irradiance, rugosity, slope, and aspect. The rank order of coral abundance (from highest to lowest) for the MHI was Porites lobata, M. patula, Pocillopora meandrina, M. capitata, Porites compressa, and M. flabellata. Mean coral cover predicted for each species was relatively low (<= 5%) at each island and for the entire MHI except for Porites lobata around Hawaii (11%). The areas of highest predicted coral cover summed for the 6 species were Kaneohe Bay on Oahu; the wave-sheltered reefs of Molokai, Lanai, Maui, and Kahoolawe; and the Kohala coast of Hawaii. Regional-scale characterizations of coral species from these SDMs provide a framework for spatially explicit population modeling and ecological inputs to marine spatial planning of Hawaiian coral reef ecosystems.

AB Imperfect detectability is a critical source of variation that limits ecological progress and frustrates effective conservation management. Available modelling methods provide valuable detectability estimates, but these are typically species-specific. We present a novel application of time-to-detection modelling in which detectability of multiple species is a function of plant traits and observer characteristics. The model is demonstrated for plants in a temperate grassland community in south-eastern Australia. We demonstrate that detectability can be estimated using observer experience, species population size and likelihood of flowering. The inclusion of flower colour and species distinctiveness improves the capacity of the model to predict detection rates for new species. We demonstrate the application of the general model to plants in a temperate grassland community, but this modelling method may be extended to other communities or taxa for which time-to-detection models are appropriate. Detectability is influenced by traits of the species and the observer. General models can be used to derive detectability estimates where repeat survey data, point counts or mark-recapture data are not available. As these data are almost always absent for species of conservation concern, general models such as ours will be useful for informing minimum survey requirements for monitoring and impact assessment, without the delays and costs associated with data collection.

AB Model validation experiments are fundamental to ensure that the peat growth models correspond with the diversity in nature. We evaluated the Holocene Peatland Model (HPM) simulation against the field observations from a chronosequence of peatlands and peat core data. The ongoing primary peatland formation on the isostatically rising coast of Finland offered us an exceptional opportunity to study the peatland succession along a spatial continuum and to compare it with the past succession revealed by vertical peat sequences. The current vegetation assemblages, from the seashore to a 3000 year old bog, formed a continuum from minerotrophic to ombrotrophic plant communities. A similar sequence of plant communities was found in the palaeovegetation. The distribution of plant functional types was related to peat thickness and water-table depth (WTD) supporting the assumptions in HPM, though there were some differences between the field data and HPM. Palaeobotanical evidence from the oldest site showed a rapid fen-bog transition, indicated by a coincidental decrease in minerotrophic plant functional types and an increase in ombrotrophic plant functional types. The long-term mean rate of carbon (C) accumulation varied from 2 to 34 g C/m(2) per yr, being highest in the intermediate age cohorts. Mean nitrogen (N) accumulation varied from 0.1 to 3.9 g N/m(2) per yr being highest in the youngest sites. WTD was the deepest in the oldest sites and its variation there was temporally the least but spatially the highest. Evaluation of the HPM simulations against the field observations indicated that HPM reasonably well simulates peatland development, except for very young peatlands.

Here, we investigate the field vole (Microtus agrestis), a Eurasian mammal with little apparent morphological differentiation but which, on the basis of previous sex-linked nuclear and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) analyses, is subdivided into a Northern and a Southern lineage, sufficiently divergent that they may represent two cryptic species. These earlier studies also provided limited evidence for two major mtDNA lineages within Iberia. In our present study, we extend these findings through a multilocus approach. We sampled 163 individuals from 46 localities, mainly in Iberia, and sequenced seven loci, maternally, paternally and biparentally inherited. Our results show that the mtDNA lineage identified in Portugal is indeed a distinct third lineage on the basis of other markers as well. In fact, multilocus coalescent-based methods clearly support three separate evolutionary units that may represent cryptic species: Northern, Southern and Portuguese. Divergence among these units was inferred to have occurred during the last glacial period; the Portuguese lineage split occurred first (estimated at c. 70 000 bp), and the Northern and Southern lineages separated at around the last glacial maximum (estimated at c. 18 500 bp). Such recent formation of evolutionary units that might be considered species has repercussions in terms of understanding evolutionary processes and the diversity of small mammals in a European context.

AB Management of the critically endangered hawksbill turtle in the Wider Caribbean (WC) has been hampered by knowledge gaps regarding stock structure. We carried out a comprehensive stock structure re-assessment of 11 WC hawksbill rookeries using longer mtDNA sequences, larger sample sizes (N = 647), and additional rookeries compared to previous surveys. Additional variation detected by 740bp sequences between populations allowed us to differentiate populations such as Barbados-Windward and Guadeloupe (F-st = 0.683, P < 0.05) that appeared genetically indistinguishable based on shorter 380bp sequences. POWSIM analysis showed that longer sequences improved power to detect population structure and that when N < 30, increasing the variation detected was as effective in increasing power as increasing sample size. Geographic patterns of genetic variation suggest a model of periodic long-distance colonization coupled with region-wide dispersal and subsequent secondary contact within the WC. Mismatch analysis results for individual clades suggest a general population expansion in the WC following a historic bottleneck about 100000300000 years ago. We estimated an effective female population size (N-ef) of 60009000 for the WC, similar to the current estimated numbers of breeding females, highlighting the importance of these regional rookeries to maintaining genetic diversity in hawksbills. Our results provide a basis for standardizing future work to 740bp sequence reads and establish a more complete baseline for determining stock boundaries in this migratory marine species. Finally, our findings illustrate the value of maintaining an archive of specimens for re-analysis as new markers become available.

AB Fires have been burning plants since the early Devonian and were common in the Mesozoic, before angiosperms became prominent. Fires were common in the Cretaceous, when angiosperms first spread to cover significant areas of the world. We suggest that this spread was facilitated by intrinsic angiosperm properties that altered fire regimes in two fundamental ways. The first was to promote more frequent fires than the slower-growing gymnosperms that they replaced. The high productivity of angiosperms would have fueled more frequent fires, while reproductive innovations allowed for more rapid recovery, particularly in upland areas too dry for ferns. The evolution of flammable grasses is the latest expression of angiosperm innovation, generating even more frequent fires capable of carving into forests, particularly after the spread of C-4 grasses from; similar to 8 Ma. The second major impact of angiosperms on fire was the development of forests. Closed broad-leaved forests fundamentally changed fire regimes by producing a vegetation structure that intrinsically excludes fires. No conifer analogues for fire-excluding forests seem to exist today or to have existed in the evolutionary past. Both fire-promoting and fire-excluding ecosystems are a product of angiosperm innovations. While these novel ecosystems may have caused the extinction of several ancient lineages, ferns and conifers still persist within them. One conifer lineage, the genus Pinus, has shown remarkable adaptability to highly flammable ecosystems, including frequently burned C-4 grasslands.

AB Ongoing monitoring in the Swiss Alps has shown that Rock Ptarmigan (Lagopus muta helvetica) has suffered a significant population decrease over the last decade and climate change has been proposed as a potential cause. In this study, we investigate the response of this high alpine grouse species to rapid climate change. We address a problem often neglected in macro-ecological studies on species distribution: scale-dependency of distribution models. The models are based on empirical field data and on environmental databases for large-scale models. The implementation of several statistical modelling approaches, external validation strategies and the implementation of a recent study on regional climate change in Switzerland ensure robust predictions of future range shifts. Our results demonstrate that, on the territory level, variables depicting vegetation, heterogeneity of local topography and habitat structure have greatest explanatory power. In contrast at the meso-scale and macro-scale (with grain sizes of 1 and 100 km(2), respectively), bioclimatic and land cover-related variables play a prominent role. The models predict that, based on increasing temperatures during the breeding season, potential habitat will decrease by up to two-thirds until the year 2070. At the same time, a shift of potential habitat towards the mountain tops is predicted. The multi-scale approach highlights the true extent of potential habitat for this species with its patchy distribution in steep terrain. The small-scale analysis pinpoints the key habitat areas within the extensive areas of suitable habitat predicted by models on large grain sizes and in this way reveals sub-grid variability. Our results can facilitate the adaptation of species conservation strategies to a quickly changing environment.

AB Soils with biological crusts that consist of fungal hyphae, bacteria and other small organisms usually resist erosion. However, the processes by which soil organisms stabilise air-dry aggregates against wind erosion are not well understood. We used saprotrophic fungi to examine some of these processes in a sandy clay loam (Hypercalcic Calcarosol). Soil aggregates, wetted with distilled water or glucose solution, were inoculated with one of six fungi, and incubated in darkness at 24 degrees C for 7 d in petri dishes under sterile conditions. Abrasion resistance (taken as resistance to wind erosion), tensile strength of soil, hot-water extractable carbohydrates (HWEC), dispersion index, pH, and hyphal length density (HLD) were each measured across all treatments. In all treatments, stability (abrasion resistance) and tensile strength, were positively related to HLD. Such relationships have not been reported elsewhere. All fungi enlarged the aggregates of the soil by cross-linkage and entanglement of particles, but with different processes, or different intensity of the processes, between species (for the same amount of substrate). The skins seen in scanning electron micrographs of stabilised soil were probably extracellular polysaccharides also produced by the fungi. We propose that the ductile failure of disks of soil, particularly those inoculated with Mucor sp., under tensile stress was due to movement of enmeshed particles, whereas the brittle failure of disks of soil inoculated with the other fungal species was due to metabolites or dispersed clay on the surface of the hyphae which limited deformation.

AB Sperm whale social groups can be assigned to vocal clans based on their production of codas, short stereotyped patterns of clicks. It is currently unclear whether genetic variation could account for these behavioural differences. We studied mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variation among sympatric vocal clans in the Pacific Ocean, using sequences extracted from sloughed skin samples. We sampled 194 individuals from 30 social groups belonging to one of three vocal clans. As in previous studies of sperm whales, mtDNA control region diversity was low (pi = 0.003), with just 14 haplotypes present in our sample. Both hierarchical AMOVAs and partial Mantel tests showed that vocal clan was a more important factor in matrilineal population genetic structure than geography, even though our sampling spanned thousands of kilometres. The variance component attributed to vocal dialects (7.7%) was an order of magnitude higher than those previously reported in birds, while the variance component attributed to geographic area was negligible. Despite this, the two most common haplotypes were present in significant quantities in each clan, meaning that variation in the control region cannot account for behavioural variation between clans, and instead parallels the situation in humans where parent-offspring transmission of language variation has resulted in correlations with neutral genes. Our results also raise questions for the management of sperm whale populations, which has traditionally been based on dividing populations into geographic 'stocks', suggesting that culturally-defined vocal clans may be more appropriate management units.

AB Prescribed fire can potentially reduce carbon emissions from unplanned fires. This potential will differ among ecosystems owing to inherent differences in the efficacy of prescribed burning in reducing unplanned fire activity (or 'leverage', i.e. the reduction in area of unplanned fire per unit area of prescribed fire). In temperate eucalypt forests, prescribed burning leverage is relatively low and potential for mitigation of carbon emissions from unplanned fires via prescribed fire is potentially limited. Simulations of fire regimes accounting for non-linear patterns of fuel dynamics for three fuel types characteristic of eucalypt forests in south-eastern Australia supported this prediction. Estimated mean annual fuel consumption increased with diminishing leverage and increasing rate of prescribed burning, even though average fire intensity (prescribed and unplanned fires combined) decreased. The results indicated that use of prescribed burning in these temperate forests is unlikely to yield a net reduction in carbon emissions. Future increases in burning rates under climate change may increase emissions and reduce carbon sequestration. A more detailed understanding of the efficacy of prescribed burning and dynamics of combustible biomass pools is required to clarify the potential for mitigation of carbon emissions in temperate eucalypt forests and other ecosystems.

AB Foraging segregation may play an important role in the maintenance of animal diversity, and is a proposed mechanism for promoting genetic divergence within seabird species. However, little information exists regarding its presence among seabird populations. We investigated genetic and foraging divergence between two colonies of endangered Hawaiian petrels (Pterodroma sandwichensis) nesting on the islands of Hawaii and Kauai using the mitochondrial Cytochrome b gene and carbon, nitrogen and hydrogen isotope values (delta C-13, delta N-15 and delta D, respectively) of feathers. Genetic analyses revealed strong differentiation between colonies on Hawaii and Kauai, with I broken vertical bar(ST) = 0.50 (p < 0.0001). Coalescent-based analyses gave estimates of < 1 migration event per 1,000 generations. Hatch-year birds from Kauai had significantly lower delta C-13 and delta N-15 values than those from Hawaii. This is consistent with Kauai birds provisioning chicks with prey derived from near or north of the Hawaiian Islands, and Hawaii birds provisioning young with prey from regions of the equatorial Pacific characterized by elevated delta N-15 values at the food web base. delta N-15 values of Kauai and Hawaii adults differed significantly, indicating additional foraging segregation during molt. Feather delta D varied from -69 to 53aEuro degrees. This variation cannot be related solely to an isotopically homogeneous ocean water source or evaporative water loss. Instead, we propose the involvement of salt gland excretion. Our data demonstrate the presence of foraging segregation between proximately nesting seabird populations, despite high species mobility. This ecological diversity may facilitate population coexistence, and its preservation should be a focus of conservation strategies.

AB Plant growth responses to resources may be an important mechanism that influences species' distributions, coexistence, and community structure. Irradiance is considered the most important resource for seedling growth in the understory of wet tropical forests, but multiple soil nutrients and species have yet to be examined simultaneously with irradiance under field conditions. To identify potentially limiting resources, we modeled tree seedling growth as a function of irradiance and soil nutrients across five sites, spanning a soil fertility gradient in old-growth, wet tropical forests at La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica. We measured an array of soil nutrients including total nitrogen (total N), inorganic N (nitrate [NO(3)(-)] and ammonium [NH(4)(+)]), phosphate (PO(4)(-)), and sum of base cations (SBC; potassium, magnesium, and calcium). Shade in the forest understory did not preclude seedling growth correlations with soil nutrients. Irradiance was a significant predictor of growth in 52% of the species, inorganic N in 54% (NO(3)(-) in 32%; NH(4)(+) in 34%), total N in 47%, SBC in 39%, and PO(4)(-) in 29%. Overall, growth was correlated with both irradiance and soil nutrients in 45% of species and with soil nutrients only in an additional 48%; rarely was irradiance alone correlated with growth. Contrary to expectations, the magnitudes of growth effects, assessed as the maximum growth response to significant resources for each species, were similar for irradiance and most soil nutrients. Among species whose growth correlated with soil nutrients, the rank importance of nutrient effects was SBC, followed by N (total N, NO(3)(-), and/or NH(4)(+)) and PO(4)(-). Species' growth responsiveness (i.e., magnitudes of effect) to irradiance and soil nutrients was negatively correlated with species' shade tolerance (survival under 1% full sun). In this broad survey of species and resources, the nearly ubiquitous effects of soil nutrients on seedling growth challenge the idea that soil nutrients are less important than irradiance in the light-limited understory of wet tropical forests.

AB Background: Big environmental disturbances have big ecological effects, yet these are not always what we might expect. Understanding the proximate effects of major disturbances, such as severe wildfires, on individuals, populations and habitats will be essential for understanding how predicted future increases in the frequency of such disturbances will affect ecosystems. However, researchers rarely have access to data from immediately before and after such events. Here we report on the effects of a severe and extensive forest wildfire on mortality, reproductive output and availability of key shelter resources for an arboreal marsupial. We also investigated the behavioural response of individuals to changed shelter resource availability in the post-fire environment.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: We fitted proximity-logging radiotransmitters to mountain brushtail possums (Trichosurus cunninghami) before, during and after the 2009 wildfires in Victoria, Australia. Surprisingly, we detected no mortality associated with the fire, and despite a significant post-fire decrease in the proportion of females carrying pouch young in the burnt area, there was no short-term post-fire population decline. The major consequence of this fire for mountain brushtail possums was the loss of over 80% of hollow-bearing trees. The types of trees preferred as shelter sites (highly decayed dead standing trees) were those most likely to collapse after fire. Individuals adapted to resource decline by being more flexible in resource selection after the fire, but not by increased resource sharing.
   Conclusions/Significance: Despite short-term demographic resilience and behavioural adaptation following this fire, the major loss of decayed hollow trees suggests the increased frequency of stand-replacing wildfires predicted under climate change will pose major challenges for shelter resource availability for hollow-dependent fauna. Hollow-bearing trees are typically biological legacies of previous forest generations in post-fire regrowth forests but will cease to be recruited to future regrowth forests if the interval between severe fires becomes too rapid for hollow formation.

AB Multiple objectives associated with recreational fishing, combined with multiple uncertainties, pose real challenges for management. We suggest that applying formal decision-making frameworks to partnership-based policy evaluations can prove beneficial to recreational fisheries management. We describe how a sequence of workshops can be used to engage scientists, managers, and other stakeholders and execute the steps of a structured decision-making process that centers on collaborative development of a quantitative forecasting model. This approach should aim to specify objectives and corresponding performance measures, identify critical uncertainties, and aid decision makers in making more informed choices among possible management options. An inclusive, participatory process can increase the transparency by which management decisions are made, provide an opportunity for tradeoffs to be discussed in a tangible way, and promote consensus building. Constructing and documenting a well-specified representation of the management process should also help reduce contention surrounding complex management decisions and promote proactive management.

AB Estuaries along the Portuguese coast differ considerably in terms of their structure, geomorphologic and hydrologic characteristics. They play an important ecological role for different fish species, namely acting as important nursery areas. The fish assemblages of nine estuaries of the Portuguese coast were investigated in order to evaluate their main inter- and intra-estuarine variability patterns. Fish sampling surveys were conducted in May and July 2006, covering the full estuarine gradient. The different saline areas in each estuary were mapped using a Geographic Information System and fish assemblages' were described and compared using a functional guilds approach. Generalized linear models were used to relate fish species richness to geomorphologic, hydrologic and environmental characteristics of the estuaries considered and correspondence analyses were performed to evaluate similarities in fish assemblages' structure. At a large scale, river flow was the most important factor explaining the variability in species richness in estuaries along the Portuguese coast. At a regional scale, different abiotic factors explained the occurrence and abundance of fish species in the estuaries. Nonetheless, the overall role of the estuary was strongly related with the dominant saline zone within each estuary. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB With growing concerns over serious ecological problems, a particular challenge is to reveal the complex mechanisms underlying rapid expansion of invasive species. Ageratina adenophora is of particular interest in addressing this question.
   We used geographic information systems and logistic regression to identify the geographic and environmental factors contributing to the presence of A. adenophora. Join-count spatial statistics with reproduction mode examination were employed to elucidate the spatiotemporal dispersal mechanisms.
   Multiple factors have significantly contributed to the rapid expansion of A. adenophora. Its biological traits, favoring dispersal by water and wind coupled with local spatiotemporally heterogeneous geography and ecology, promote invasion downstream and upstream along river valleys, while other factors associated with human activities facilitate its invasion over high mountains and across river valleys, providing new scope for progressive invasions. We further identified an unusual invasion event of A. adenophora subsequent to a great flood that amplified its dispersal ability from vegetative propagules and seeds.
   These findings suggest that dynamic interactions of multiple factors in heterogeneous ecogeographical environments - a 'combinatorial' invasion mechanism would generate an unexpected invasion rate of an alien species or a seemingly stochastic invasion event.

AB Aim
   Species distribution models (SDMs) are used to infer niche responses and predict climate change-induced range shifts. However, their power to distinguish real and chance associations between spatially autocorrelated distribution and environmental data at continental scales has been questioned. Here this is investigated at a regional (10 km) scale by modelling the distributions of 100 plant species native to the UK.
   Location
   UK.
   Methods
   SDMs fitted using real climate data were compared with those utilizing simulated climate gradients. The simulated gradients preserve the exact values and spatial structure of the real ones, but have no causal relationships with any species and so represent an appropriate null model. SDMs were fitted as generalized linear models (GLMs) or by the Random Forest machine-learning algorithm and were either non-spatial or included spatially explicit trend surfaces or autocovariates as predictors.
   Results
   Species distributions were significantly but erroneously related to the simulated gradients in 86% of cases (P < 0.05 in likelihood-ratio tests of GLMs), with the highest error for strongly autocorrelated species and gradients and when species occupied 50% of sites. Even more false effects were found when curvilinear responses were modelled, and this was not adequately mitigated in the spatially explicit models. Non-spatial SDMs based on simulated climate data suggested that 70-80% of the apparent explanatory power of the real data could be attributable to its spatial structure. Furthermore, the niche component of spatially explicit SDMs did not significantly contribute to model fit in most species.
   Main conclusions
   Spatial structure in the climate, rather than functional relationships with species distributions, may account for much of the apparent fit and predictive power of SDMs. Failure to account for this means that the evidence for climatic limitation of species distributions may have been overstated. As such, predicted regional- and national-scale impacts of climate change based on the analysis of static distribution snapshots will require re-evaluation.

AB Pollination syndromes involve convergent evolution towards phenotypes composed of specific scents, colours or floral morphologies that attract or restrict pollinator access to reward. How these traits might influence the distributions of plant species in interaction with pollinators has rarely been investigated. We sampled 870 vegetation plots in the western Swiss Alps and classified the plant species into seven blossom types according to their floral morphology (wind, disk, funnel, tube, bilabiate, head or brush). We investigated the environmental features of plots with functional diversity (FD) lower than expected by chance alone to detect potential pollination filtering and related the proportions of the seven blossom types to a combination of environmental descriptors. From these results, we inferred the potential effect of the pollinator on the spatial distribution of plant species. The vegetation plots with significantly lower FD of blossom types than expected by chance were found at higher altitudes, and the proportions of blossom types were strongly patterned along the same gradient. These results support a biotic filtering effect on plant species assemblages through pollination: disk blossoms became dominant at higher altitudes, resulting in a lower FD. In harsh conditions at high altitudes, pollinators usually decrease in activity, and the openness of the disk blossom grants access to any available pollinator. Inversely, bilabiate blossoms, which are mostly pollinated by bees, were more abundant at lower elevations, which are characterised by greater abundance and diversity of bees. Generalisation through openness of the blossom could be advantageous at high elevations, while specialisation could be a successful alternative strategy at lower elevations. The approach used in this study is purely correlative, and further investigations should be conducted to infer the nature of the causal relationship between plant and pollinator distributions.

AB Microsatellite or simple sequence repeats (SSRs) are one of the most used markers in population genetic studies. SSR markers developed from expressed sequence tags (EST) have proved useful to examine functional diversity in relation to adaptive variation. The information provided by both genomic and genic microsatellite markers could offer more accurate indication on the distribution of the genetic diversity among and within populations assuming different evolutionary drivers. This is the first study on chestnut (Castanea sativa Mill.) in which the genetic diversity was evaluated by means of genomic (SSRs) and genic (EST-SSRs) microsatellite markers. We genotyped nine natural European chestnut populations distributed throughout representative areas of contrasting climatic conditions in the Mediterranean basin. Genomic SSRs showed significantly higher levels of diversity in terms of number of alleles, effective number of alleles, expected heterozygosity and level of polymorphism. Furthermore, there were significant differences in the level of differentiation among populations. The UPGMA analysis revealed different clustering pattern between populations, being the grouping according to geographic distances in the case of genomic SSRs and two differentiated groups based on the northern-southern distribution of the populations for EST-SSRs. Furthermore, the EST-SSR transferability among related Castanea and Quercus species was stated. Our results confirm that combining genomic SSRs and EST-SSRs is a useful tool to give complementary information to explain the genetic and adaptive diversity in chestnut.

AB Identifying population structure is one of the most common and important objectives of spatial analyses using population genetic data. Population structure is detected either by rejecting the null hypothesis of a homogenous distribution of genetic variation, or by estimating low migration rates. Issues arise with most current population genetic inference methods when the genetic divergence is low among putative populations. Low levels of genetic divergence may be as a result of either high ongoing migration or historic high migration but no current, ongoing migration. We direct attention to recent developments in the use of the tempo-spatial distribution of closely related individuals to detect population structure or estimate current migration rates. These 'kinship-based' approaches complement more traditional population-based genetic inference methods by providing a means to detect population structure and estimate current migration rates when genetic divergence is low. However, for kinship-based methods to become widely adopted, formal estimation procedures applicable to a range of species life histories are needed.

AB Food webs of many ecosystems are sustained by organic matter from other habitats. Human activities and climatic change are increasingly modifying the quality and supply of these resources, yet for most ecosystems it is unknown how the taxonomic composition of organic matter influences community composition. Along the coastline of Sydney, Australia, the once abundant habitat-forming macroalga, Phyllospora comosa, is now locally extinct. Shallow reefs are now primarily occupied by Sargassum sp. and, to a lesser extent, the kelp Ecklonia radiata. We experimentally manipulated the supply of P. comosa, Sargassum sp. and E. radiata to estuarine sediments to assess responses by macroinvertebrate communities to: (1) changing the identity of the dominant detrital resource; and (2) varying the ratio of input of different macrophytes. Estuarine sediments dosed with P. comosa supported greater abundances of macroinvertebrates than sediments receiving Sargassum sp. or the kelp E. radiata. Whereas plots receiving Sargassum sp. or E. radiata had fewer macroinvertebrates than controls, plots receiving a moderate (120 g dry weight per m(2)) loading of P. comosa had more. Mixtures of detritus dominated by P. comosa supported similar macroinvertebrate communities to monocultures of the alga. Communities in sediments receiving detritus comprised of less than one-third P. comosa were, however, distinctly different. Our study provides evidence that the ecological ramifications of species decline can extend to spatially removed ecosystems, subsidised by allochthonous materials. Even prior to extinction of detrital sources, small changes in their provision of organic matter may alter the structure of subsidised communities.

AB We applied a multivariate statistical modelling technique called boosted regression trees to derive relationships between environmental conditions and the distribution of the adult stage of the cyclopoid copepod Oithona smiths in the Southern Ocean Nearly 20 000 samples from the Southern Ocean Continuous Plankton Recorder survey (87% from East Antarctica) were used to model the probability of detection (presence) and relative abundance of adults of this zooplankton species in surface waters. We demonstrate that it is possible to obtain reasonable models for both the presence (area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve of 0.77) and relative abundance (28-35% variance explained) of adult O similis between November and March in much of the Southern Ocean No investigation was possible where the environmental characteristics were not well represented by the SO-CPR dataset, namely, the Argentine shelf, Weddell Sea, and the frontal region north of the Amundsen Sea, or under sea-ice Our analyses support the hypothesis that adult O similis abundance is related to environmental conditions in a broadly similar way throughout the Southern Ocean. Compared to a compilation of net-haul data from the literature, the abundance model explained 34% of the variance in surface concentrations of adult stages of this species, and 23-59% of the variance in depth-integrated abundance of copepodite and adult stages combined. The models show higher occurrence and elevated abundances in a broad circumpolar band between the Antarctic Polar Front and the southern boundary of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (approximately 54-64 degrees S) Evidence of diel vertical migration by adults of this species north of 65 degrees S was found, with surface abundances 20% higher at night than during the day. There was no evidence of diel migration south of 65 degrees S. Five potential "hotspots" of adult O similis were identified in the southern Scotia Sea, two areas off east Antarctica, in the frontal zone north of the Amundsen Sea, and a small area in the outer Bellingshausen Sea We recommend that a database of all available net-haul data on Oithona smiths in the Southern Ocean be created to facilitate further investigations on the circumpolar distribution of this species Crown Copyright (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB This paper provides an assessment of the biological attributes of fish species in south-eastern Australia and rates their potential risk from the impacts of drought. We used scientific literature and expert opinion to conduct a semiquantitative assessment of attributes considered to influence species resistance and resilience to drought for 15 freshwater fish species found in south-eastern Australia. We also present a conceptual framework to guide management of fish populations during drought. The framework focuses on (1) quantifying spatial variation in the severity of drought impacts on particular habitats (rivers, wetlands, etc.), (2) assembling information on drought sensitivities of regionally important species, (3) identifying high risk areas (based on species sensitivity and drought severity), (4) determining and implementing appropriate management actions (pre-emptive, responsive), (5) monitoring outcomes and (6) disseminating information on outcomes. In many regions, historic population declines will serve to exacerbate the impacts of drought, and thus are a major threat to successful recovery from drought. Although we discuss both long-term, pre-emptive planning and short-term, responsive management actions, we contend that a long-term view is required to successfully address the threats posed by drought. Furthermore, although droughts clearly represent a severe disturbance to fish populations, ultimately it is anthropogenic factors that exacerbate drought and constrain recovery pathways (at global, regional and local scales), rather than drought per se. These factors must be addressed if we are to ensure the long-term viability of fish populations in inland aquatic ecosystems.

AB The pinniped family Otariidae (sea lions and fur seals) is composed of 7 extant genera with 14 species. They are mainly distributed in the Southern Hemisphere, but the fossil record is only known from the Northern Hemisphere until Pliocene. To clarify the biological and zoogeographical events during their evolution, it is necessary to reconstruct a robust phylogenetic tree. However, phylogenetic relationships among otariids continue to be controversial, except for the basal position of the northern fur seal among the extant otariids. We reconstructed phylogenetic trees of otariids based on mitochondrial genomes and multiple nuclear genes (IRBP and type I STS markers). The monophyly of the otariids including both sea lions and fur seals in the Southern Hemisphere was strongly supported by both the mitochondrial and nuclear evidence. We propose a novel evolutionary and dispersal scenario of otariids based on this phylogenetic hypothesis, estimated divergence times, and fossil records. According to our results, the center of origin of the southern otariids is hypothesized to be the eastern South Pacific along the west coast of South America. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AB Factors controlling brown trout Salmo trutta recruitment in Mediterranean areas are largely unknown, despite the relevance this may have for fisheries management. The effect of hydrological variability on survival of young brown trout was studied during seven consecutive years in five resident populations from the southern range of the species distribution. Recruit density at the end of summer varied markedly among year-classes and rivers during the study period. Previous work showed that egg density the previous fall did not account for more than 50% of the observed variation in recruitment density. Thus, we expected that climatic patterns, as determinants of discharge and water temperature, would play a role in the control of young trout abundance. We tested this by analyzing the effects of flow variation and predictability on young trout survival during the spawning to emergence and the summer drought periods. Both hatching and emergence times and length of hatching and emergence periods were similar between years within each river but varied considerably among populations, due to differences in water temperature. Interannual variation in flow attributes during spawning to emergence and summer drought affected juvenile survival in all populations, once the effect of endogenous factors was removed. Survival rate was significantly related to the timing, magnitude and duration of extreme water conditions, and to the rate of change in discharge during hatching and emergence times in most rivers. The magnitude and duration of low flows during summer drought appeared to be a critical factor for survival of young trout. Our findings suggest that density-independent factors, i.e., hydrological variability, play a central role in the population dynamics of brown trout in populations from low-latitude range margins. Reported effects of hydrologic attributes on trout survival are likely to be increasingly important if, as predicted, climate change leads to greater extremes and variability of flow regimes.

AB Many seabird populations are currently decreasing, especially albatrosses for which the primary threat is recognised to be mortality in fisheries. introduced predators, climate change and other factors such as diseases can also have large impacts on seabirds. Here, we assessed the relative effect of three potential threats: climate, fisheries and diseases on the demography of an endangered marine predator and modelled its population dynamics to project its size under different scenarios. We based our study on a longterm monitoring of a colony of individually marked Indian yellow-nosed albatrosses at Amsterdam Island, subtropical Indian Ocean. that has declined during the past twenty years. We found no evidence for an impact of legal tuna longlining on demographic parameters. Hatching success was lower during El Nino years but survival (0.902 +/- 0.011) was not affected by climatic factors. Avian cholera caused high chick mortality (0.808 +/- 0.181) which in turn probably triggered the high emigration rate (0.038 +/- 0.011) through dispersal of failed breeders. This colony has a high risk of extinction. However, the rest of the population at Amsterdam Island seemingly not affected to the same extent, declined but stabilised since 1998. Matrix models indicated that lowered adult survival and the very low breeding success, resulting in low recruitment, have both contributed to the decline of the yellow-nosed albatross colony until the mid-1990s, but that more recent decline was primarily caused by low fledging success. Our results highlight that potential threats such as fisheries, diseases or climate have to be considered simultaneously to disentangle their roles when assessing the conservation status of a marine predator species.

AB We review the observed and potential effects of climate change on native fauna of forests in northeastern North America by focusing on mammals, birds, amphibians, and insects. Our assessment is placed in the context of recent regional-scale climate projections. Climate change, particularly in recent decades, has affected the distribution and abundance of numerous wildlife species. Warming temperatures, alterations to precipitation regimes, seasonality, and climatic extremes are projected to affect species directly or indirectly in each of the focal taxa. Greatest climate change will occur during winter, and the survival of winter-active species as well as the survival, distribution, and abundance of hibernating mammals, amphibians, resident birds, and diapausing insects may be altered. Even under low emissions scenarios, effects on native fauna may be profound, affecting iconic species, endangered species, and species that provide economically valuable services, such as pollination and regulation of insect populations. However, much research that is essential to assessing the effects of climate change on the native fauna of northeastern forests remains to be done. Research that reveals causal mechanisms and relates these findings to population and community level processes will be most valuable.

AB Intraspecific diversity can influence the structure of associated communities, though whether litter-based and foliage-based arthropod communities respond to intraspecific diversity in similar ways remains unclear. In this study, we compared the effects of host-plant genotype and genotypic diversity of the perennial plant, Solidago altissima, on the arthropod community associated with living plant tissue (foliage-based community) and microarthropods associated with leaf litter (litter-based community). We found that variation among host-plant genotypes had strong effects on the diversity and composition of foliage-based arthropods, but only weak effects on litter-based microarthropods. Furthermore, host-plant genotypic diversity was positively related to the abundance and diversity of foliage-based arthropods, and within the herbivore and predator trophic levels. In contrast, there were minimal effects of plant genotypic diversity on litter-based microarthropods in any trophic level. Our study illustrates that incorporating communities associated with living foliage and senesced litter into studies of community genetics can lead to very different conclusions about the importance of intraspecific diversity than when only foliage-based community responses are considered in isolation.

AB In the Northern Hemisphere, the surface of south-facing slopes orients toward the sun and thus receives a greater duration and intensity of solar irradiation, resulting in a relatively warmer, drier microclimate and seasonal environmental extremes. This creates potentially detrimental conditions for evergreen plants which must endure the full gamut of conditions. I hypothesize that (1) increased southerly aspect will correlate negatively with evergreen understory plant distributions; (2) derived environmental variables (summer and winter light and heat load) will predict variance in evergreen distributions as well as topographic position (aspect, slope, and elevation) and (3) winter light will best predict evergreen understory plant distributions. In order to test these hypotheses, survey data were collected characterizing 10 evergreen understory herb distributions (presence, abundance, and reproduction) as well as the corresponding topographical information across north- and south-facing slopes in the North Carolina mountains and Georgia piedmont. The best predictive models were selected using AIC, and Bayesian hierarchical generalized linear models were used to estimate the strength of the retained coefficients. As predicted, evergreen understory herbs occurred and reproduced less on south-facing than north-facing slopes, though slope and elevation also had robust predictive power, and both discriminated well between evergreen species. While the landscape variables explained where the plants occurred, winter light and heat load provided the best explanation why they were there. Evergreen plants likely are limited on south-facing slopes by low soil moisture combined with high temperatures in summer and high irradiance combined with lower temperatures in winter. The robust negative response of the understory evergreen herbs to increased winter light also suggested that the winter rather than the summer (or growing season) environment provided the best predictive power for understory evergreen distributions, which has substantive implications for predicting responses to global climate change.

AB Background and Aims The widely accepted paradigm that the modern genetic structure of plant species in the northern hemisphere has been largely determined by recolonization from refugia after the last glacial maximum fails to explain the presence of cold-tolerant species at intermediate latitudes. Another generally accepted paradigm is that mountain ridges act as important barriers causing genetic isolation of species, but this too has been challenged in recent studies. The aims of the work reported here were to determine the genetic diversity and distribution patterns of extant natural populations of an endangered cool temperate species, Faxinus mandshurica, and to examine whether these two paradigms are appropriate when applied to this species over a wide geographical scale.
   Methods 1435 adult individuals were sampled from 30 natural populations across the main and central range of the species, covering major mountain ranges across North-east China (NEC). Genetic variation was estimated based on nine polymorphic nuclear microsatellite loci. Phylogeographical analyses were employed using various approaches, including Bayesian clustering, spatial analysis of molecular variance, Monmonier's algorithm, neighbor-joining trees, principal co-ordinate analysis and isolation by distance.
   Key Results Genetic diversity within populations was relatively high, and no significant recent bottlenecks were detected in any of the populations. A significant negative correlation between intra-population genetic diversity and latitude was identified. In contrast, genetic differentiation among all the populations examined was extremely low and no clear geographic genetic structure was identified, with the exception of one distinct population.
   Conclusions The modern genetic structure in this species can be explained by extensive gene flow, an absence of mountains acting as barriers, and the presence of a wide refuge across NEC rather than multiple small refugia. Intra-population genetic variation along latitudes is probably associated with the systematically northward shifts of forest biomes in eastern China during the mid-Holocene. To determine important genetic patterns and identify resources for conservation, however, it will be necessary to examine differentially inherited genetic markers exposed to selection pressures (e.g. chloroplast DNA) and to investigate different generations.

AB Enhanced sequestration of plant-carbon (C) inputs to soil may mitigate rising atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations and related climate change but how this sequestration will respond to anthropogenic nitrogen (N) and phosphorous (P) deposition is uncertain. We couple isotope, soil C fractionation and mesocosm techniques to assess the sequestration of plant-C inputs, and their partitioning into C pools with different sink potentials, under an experimental gradient of N and P deposition (0, 10, 30, 60 and 100 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1); and 0, 2, 6, 12 and 20 kg P ha(-1) yr(-1)). We hypothesized that N deposition would increase sequestration, with the majority of the C being sequestered in faster cycling soil pools because N deposition has been shown to accelerate the turnover of these pools while decelerating the turnover of slower cycling pools. In contrast to this hypothesis, sequestration into all soil C pools peaked at intermediate levels of N deposition. Given that P amendment has been shown to cause a net loss of soil C, we postulated that P deposition would decrease sequestration. This expectation was not supported by our data, with sequestration generally being greater under P deposition. When soils were amended simultaneously with N and P, neither the shape of the sequestration relationship across the deposition gradient, nor the observed sequestration at the majority of the deposition rates, was statistically predictable from the effects of N and P in isolation. The profound nonlinearities we observed, both for total sequestration responses and the partitioning of C into soil pools with different sink potentials, suggests that the rates of N and P deposition to ecosystems will be the critical determinant of whether they enhance or decrease the long-term sequestration of fresh plant-C inputs to soils.

AB Conservation genetics typically seeks to map the distribution of contemporary genetic variation across space, and to use the resulting genetic parameters to infer any likely short-term evolutionary consequences for rare and endangered species. Recent developments in the study of ancient DNA now enable the extension of genetic variation studies backwards in time and provide a context by which to interpret contemporary levels of genetic variation, in addition to any patterns of genetic change over time. Ancient DNA research can also help to determine past levels of genetic diversity, identify species' boundaries and reveal former ranges among morphologically cryptic taxa. Ancient DNA sequence data for the New Zealand kiwi (Apteryx spp.) are presented and we show that most ancient populations of rowi and tokoeka exhibited private mitochondrial DNA haplotypes. Moreover, we illustrate that the extinction of these populations has led to the loss of considerable genetic variation. We also use ancient DNA methodology to determine past species distributions for brown kiwi and great spotted kiwi whose bones are morphologically indistinguishable.

AB Habitat fragmentation and associated reduced dispersal of wildlife can lead to an accumulation of related individuals in fragments. The altered kin interactions and amplified chance of inbred matings has profound implications for mating and social systems, and ultimately population persistence. Nonetheless, within-fragment population processes are rarely studied. With this aim, we examined relatedness structure in two candidate isolated populations (Kulpara and Scrubby Peak) of southern hairy-nosed wombats (Lasiorhinus latifrons). Wombats were sampled by remote hair-trapping for genotyping at 14 microsatellite loci, enabling individual identification and estimation of space-use and associative behaviour with respect to relatedness. Genetic data indicated that Scrubby Peak was not strongly isolated, against predictions from landscape structure and history. In isolated Kulpara, inhibited female dispersal (normally the dispersing sex) was associated with high population density and altered kin relationships. First, female relatives preferentially coexisted, a radical departure from the previously reported active avoidance of female relatives in continuous habitat. This is consistent with females in altered habitat interacting with more- rather than less-related females to minimize the cost:benefit ratio of proximity to other wombats. Second, inbreeding avoidance appeared to be stronger at Kulpara than in conspecific populations with natural population structures. Although these adaptive behaviours may have contributed to persistence of the Kulpara population in the short term, they are unlikely to ensure its long-term viability in the face of ongoing isolation because they can act only to slow the rate of inbreeding and mitigate some of its negative impacts.

AB Climate affects many aspects of stream ecosystems, although the presence of riparian forests can buffer differences between streams in different climatic settings. In an attempt to measure the importance of climate, we compared the seasonal patterns of hydrology, input and storage of allochthonous organic matter, and the trophic structure (abundance of algae and macroinvertebrates) in two temperate forested streams, one Mediterranean, the other Atlantic. Hydrology played a leading role in shaping the trophic structure of both streams. Frequency and timing of floods and droughts determined benthic detritus storage. Inputs and retention of allochthonous organic matter were higher in the Atlantic stream, whereas chlorophyll concentration was lower because of stronger light limitation. Instead, light availability and scour of particulate organic matter during late winter favoured higher chlorophyll concentration in the Mediterranean stream. As a result, in the Mediterranean stream grazers were more prevalent and consumers showed a higher dependence on autotrophic materials. On the other hand, the Atlantic stream depended on allochthonous materials throughout the whole study period. The overall trophic structure showed much stronger seasonality in the Mediterranean than in the Atlantic stream, this being the most distinctive difference between these two types of temperate streams. The different patterns observed in the two streams are an indication that climatic differences should be incorporated in proper measurements of ecosystem health. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

AB To manage coral reef species, it is important to identify the factors that determine their distribution inexpensively. We identified the remotely measured environmental factors that are most influential in determining the distributions of coral reef fish species on a regional scale. Logistic regression models for 227 fish species related presence/absence data to 4 remotely determined environmental predictor variables: depth, presence of a land-sea interface, exposure, and the distance to the nearest estuary. We compared modeled Akaike information criterion (AIC) values with AIC values of randomly distributed species with different numbers of occurrences and levels of habitat specificity to evaluate model significance. Efficient species distribution models were identified for 118 predominantly habitat-specific fishes of the 227 species for which we had data. All 4 predictor variables significantly influenced the distributions of at least some fish species. Depth was the most frequently efficient variable for single variable models. For combinations of 2 predictor variables, depth and exposure, as well as depth and distance from the nearest estuary, were the prevalent predictors of fish distributions. Several fish species responded to the combination of variables distance from an estuary and presence of the terrestrial-marine interface, indicating that these species depend on intact coastal reef habitat, which is in decline near the main sediment-laden rivers. Statistically significant models were predominantly developed for habitat-specific species. These habitat-specific species are of greater conservation concern than widespread species because threats affect them more severely if the threats are selectively affecting their habitat. For this reason, species distribution modeling using remotely determined environmental data may be an efficient method to build models for habitat-specific species and inform marine reserve design.

AB Genetic benefits can enhance the fitness of polyandrous females through the high intrinsic genetic quality of females' mates or through the interaction between female and male genes. I used a full diallel cross, a quantitative genetics design that involves all possible crosses among a set of genetically homogeneous lines, to determine the mechanism through which polyandrous female decorated crickets (Gryllodes sigillatus) obtain genetic benefits. I measured several traits related to fitness and partitioned the phenotypic variance into components representing the contribution of additive genetic variance ('good genes'), nonadditive genetic variance (genetic compatibility), as well as maternal and paternal effects. The results reveal a significant variance attributable to both nonadditive and additive sources in the measured traits, and their influence depended on which trait was considered. The lack of congruence in sources of phenotypic variance among these fitness-related traits suggests that the evolution and maintenance of polyandry are unlikely to have resulted from one selective influence, but rather are the result of the collective effects of a number of factors.

AB In this paper, a model that integrates various complex model components for the purposes of water balance modeling throughout crop development in and inland region under the conventional flood irrigation practiced is presented. These components are modules for calculating dynamic soil water content based Richard's equation, potential and actual evapotranspiration, and crop root water uptake. Soil water content in the active root zone and soil evaporation simulation obtained from the model were test using field data in 2003. The low values of MARE and high values of R 2 and PE in the active root zone of soil profile as well as daily soil evaporation indicated that the soil water balance simulation model presented in the paper can be used with reliable accuracy to simulate the components of water balance in cropped sandy soil under the conventional flood irrigation condition in and inland regions. The model simulation on components of water balance using observed field data in 2004 indicated that large quantities - about 43% of irrigation water (amounting to 840 mm) - were consumed by deep percolation, only small (less than 41%) proportions of irrigation water used by the plants for transpiration. The current irrigation scheme is characterized by the unreasonable agricultural water management with the waste of water in the irrigational system in this region. The impact of irrigation scheduling on water balance presented in this paper showed that the reasonable irrigation scheme with more frequent irrigation and less amounts is more suitable for the irrigation of spring wheat in Heihe River basin, northwest China. Therefore, to establish a decision-making system for agricultural irrigation scheme and to utilize the limited water resources in this region have become an urgent problem that needs to be solved.

AB This paper presents the results of 2 yr of CO2 flux measurements on grassland communities of varying species richness, exposed to either the current or a warmer climate.
   We grew experimental plant communities containing one, three or nine grassland species in 12 sunlit, climate-controlled chambers. Half of these chambers were exposed to ambient air temperatures, while the other half were warmed by 3 C. Equal amounts of water were added to heated and unheated communities, implying drier soils if warming increased evapotranspiration. Three main CO2 fluxes (gross photosynthesis, above-ground and below-ground respiration) were measured multiple times per year and reconstructed hourly or half-hourly by relating them to their most important environmental driver.
   While CO2 outputs through respiration were largely unchanged under warming, CO2 inputs through photosynthesis were lowered, especially in summer, when heat and drought stress were higher. Above-ground CO2 fluxes were significantly increased in multispecies communities, as more complementary resource use stimulated productivity. Finally, effects of warming appeared to be smallest in monocultures.
   This study shows that in a future warmer climate the CO2 sink capacity of temperate grasslands could decline, and that such adverse effects are not likely to be mitigated by efforts to maintain or increase species richness.

AB Ecological thresholds are defined as points or zones at which a rapid change occurs from one ecological condition to another. The existence of thresholds in species - habitat relationships has important implications for management, but the lack of concordance across studies and the wide range of methods used make generalizations difficult. We used two different statistical methods to test for the existence of thresholds for both individual species and the whole community, using three newt species as models. Based on a sample of 371 ponds, we found significant thresholds for both landscape configuration and composition. These were for the relationships between distance to forest and occurrence of Triturus alpestris and T. helveticus, and forest and crop cover and T. helveticus. Variability in the location of thresholds observed for the different species in this study caution against their use at the community level. Future studies should be based on the identification and assessment of thresholds for targeted species. Thresholds can be a useful concept from which tools may be developed to focus conservation effort for threatened species and their habitats.

AB Forest edges have been long recognized as the first landscape elements to be invaded by alien plant species in forest ecosystems. However, little is known about the role of forest edge type in invasive species patterns. In the Northern Rocky Mountains of the United States, disturbance-caused forest edges are a common feature in the landscape with anthropogenic (e.g. roadside, clearcut) and natural (e.g. burned, windthrown) edge types. In this paper we examine patterns of alien species invasion and native community structure across three forest edge types in Pinus contorta forests including contrasts between undeveloped landscapes in Yellowstone National Park (YNP), and developed (roaded and logged) portions of the adjacent Gallatin National Forest (GNF). Six sets of transects were located in each of five study sites, including clearcut, burn and highway edge types. When burn and highways edges were compared between GNF and YNP, landscape matrix did not have a significant effect on either alien species richness or cover. In both landscapes, highway edges had higher alien species richness and cover than burn edges. For burn and highway edges, alien species richness and cover were significantly related to edge type, distance from edge and the interaction between both variables. In Gallatin NF, alien species were concentrated along highway edges, while burn and clearcut edges are significantly less invaded. Overall, alien species richness was negatively correlated with native species richness in plots with at least one alien species (R(2) = 0.30, p < 0.001). We were able to explain from 23 to 68% of the variation in alien species richness from simple measures of vegetation structure within each of the edge types. Our study suggests that at least for high elevation conifer ecosystems such as West Yellowstone, alien plant invasion into interior forest is significantly enhanced by disturbance edges only along roadsides. Further studies are needed to determine causal mechanisms that explain the high degree of invisibility of roadside edges. Our results highlight the need for careful planning and management of roads, as they may become a primary conduit of alien plant invasions. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Bird assemblages generally are no longer regarded as stable entities, but rather as fluctuating in response to many factors. Australia's highly variable climate is likely to result in a high degree of dynamism in its bird assemblages, yet few studies have investigated variation on an inter-annual temporal scale. We compared 2 year-long samples of the bird assemblages of a series of highly fragmented buloke Allocasuarina luehmannii (Casuarinaceae) woodland remnants in south-eastern Australia, the first sample taken in 1994-95 and the second in 2001-02. Bird densities were almost three times higher in the second period than in the first. Mean species richness also was significantly higher. Species richness of each individual site was unrelated between the 2 years. Minimum species turnover was 63% and was higher, on average, for migratory and nomadic than for sedentary species. Therefore, site-level bird assemblage composition was markedly different between the two survey periods and, on average, the assemblage composition of each site bore greater resemblance to those of other sites in the same year than to that of the same site in the other survey period. Most species changed substantially in their distribution among remnants between the two periods. The change in distribution of most species did not differ significantly from that expected if the species had redistributed at random among the sites. This suggests that although the remnant vegetation of the area is highly fragmented with minimal interpatch connectivity, bird movements among remnants are relatively frequent. Inter-annual variability in Australian bird assemblages may be higher than is commonly recognized. In such dynamic systems, we must be cautious when extrapolating from the findings of short-term studies to longer temporal scales, especially in relation to conservation management. A greater understanding of the processes driving distributional patterns is likely to enable better predictions of species' responses to habitat change.

AB Predicting ecological consequences of climate change will be improved by understanding how species are affected by contemporary climate variation, particularly if analyses involve more than single ecological variables and focus on large-scale climate phenomena. I used 18 years of data from red-winged blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus) studied over a 25-year period in eastern Ontario to explore chronological and climate-related patterns of reproduction. Although blackbirds started nesting earlier in years with warmer springs, associated with low winter values of the North Atlantic Oscillation Index (NAOI), there was no advance in laying dates over the study. Nesting ended progressively later and the breeding season lasted longer over the study, however, associated with higher spring values of NAOI. As the length of the nesting season increased, offspring sex ratios became more female biased, apparently as a result of females adjusting the sex of the eggs they laid, rather than from sex-biased nestling mortality. Clutch size did not vary systematically over the study or with climate. Opposing trends of declining nest success and increasing productivity of successful nests over the study resulted in no chronological change in productivity per female. Higher productivity of successful nests was associated with higher winter NAOI values, possibly because synchrony between nesting and food availability was higher in years with high NAOI values. Other than the association between the start of nesting and spring temperatures, local weather (e.g., temperature, rainfall) patterns that linked NAOI with reproduction were not identified, suggesting that weather patterns may be complex. Because climate affected most aspects of red-winged blackbird reproduction examined, focusing on associations between climate and single variables (e.g., first-egg dates) will have limited value in predicting how future climates will affect populations.

AB Associations between extinction and habitat fragmentation have been modelled and described, but we document the first clear mechanistic link between habitat fragmentation and population persistence. demonstrating that a rapid evolutionary response to fragmentation can yield conditions wherein some populations are more vulnerable to extinction. Historical differences in the partitioning and tenure of land in southwestern North America has resulted in vast differences in parcel sizes. Smaller parcels at the eastern edge (western Oklahoma) of the shortgrass prairie are bounded by far more fence and traversed by far more roads and power lines than are larger parcels at the western edge (eastern New Mexico). The increased extent of fencing. roads and power lines is associated with higher mortality of female, but not male. lesser prairie-chickens (Tympanuchus pallidicinctus), a rare species endemic to the south-central United States. Differences in mortality rates appear to have selected for differences in life history strategies: relative to females in New Mexico. female prairie-chickens in Oklahoma lay larger clutches and nest fewer years but make more attempts within a year. The results of this trade-off have left Oklahoma birds far more susceptible to year-to-year environmental perturbations, explaining that population's rapid decline relative to the more stable populations in New Mexico.

AB Causes of differences in photosynthetic nitrogen-use efficiency (PNUE), the rate of photosynthesis per unit leaf N, were investigated in four species. These were in order of decreasing PNUE; the two herbs Galinsoga ciliata and Origanum vulgare, and the two trees Populus nigra and Quercus robur. Plants were grown in pots outdoors at three levels of nutrient availability. The light- and CO2 response of gas exchange of leaves were measured, and their nitrogen and chlorophyll contents were determined. Furthermore, the internal conductance for CO2 diffusion was estimated. Nutrients did not have a large effect on PNUE except in Galinsoga. Leaf mass per unit area was negatively correlated with PNUEmax, which is likely to be partly caused by N present in cell wall proteins among other non-photosynthetic N compounds. The trees had a larger fraction of photosynthetic N in light harvesting components compared to the herbs. This contributed also substantially to the difference in PNUE at light saturation (PNUEmax) between the two groups, but not for PNUE calculated for an overcast day. Intercellular CO2 concentration was high in Galinsoga and Populus, which contributed significantly to their higher PNUEmax, particularly at low nutrient availability. The large gradient in CO2 concentration between intercellular spaces and chloroplasts was another factor that explained a substantial part of the differences in PNUEmax between Quercus and the other species that had smaller gradients. Stomatal and internal conductances for CO2 explained most of the difference in PNUEmax between Quercus and Populus at high nutrient availability for which these data were available.

AB Oryza rufipogon Griff. is the most agriculturally important but seriously endangered wild rice species. To better estimate how genetic structure can be used to obtained a conservation perspective of the species, genetic variability at six polymorphic microsatellite DNA loci was examined. High levels of genetic variability were detected at six loci in 1245 individuals of 47 natural populations covering most of the species' range in China (overall R-s = 3.0740, H-o = 0.2290, H-S = 0.6700). Partitioning of genetic variability (F-ST = 0.246) showed that most microsatellite variation was distributed within populations. Significant departures from Hardy-Weinberg expectations and very strong linkage disequilibrium indicate a high degree of inbreeding in the species and severe subdivision within populations. A mean Nm value of 0.7662 suggested a limited gene flow among the assayed populations. Our study suggests that conservation and restoration genetics should focus in particular on the maintenance of historically significant processes such as high levels of outbreeding and gene flow and large effective population size in the species.

AB Diffusion of ions in the soil depends on soil moisture content. In a dry soil, transport of nutrients towards the root and the concomitant uptake could be reduced. However, pot and field experiments showed that this is not always the case. The objective of this paper was to investigate possible mechanisms of plants to counteract reduced nutrient supply due to water shortage. A split root system was used to investigate P and K inflow of oat and sugar beet at different soil moisture contents (Theta) without water shortage for the plant. The measured average P and K inflows were compared to model calculations considering diffusion, mass-flow, sorption and uptake processes. In the calculations, soil dryness impeded diffusion and decreased nutrient inflow as expected. Measured K inflow was decreased in a similar way indicating that Theta influences K diffusion. In contrast to this, measured P inflow was not influenced by Theta and under-estimated by the model. Low and high molecular exudates were collected at different water supply levels showing that exudation rate of both compounds was increased at water shortage. Especially the high molecular exudates (i.e. mainly mucilage) from water-stressed plants increased P concentration in soil solution under dry conditions in an incubation experiment. Calculated inflow considering this increased P concentration agreed well with measured P inflow indicating that exudation of mucilage could be a mechanism to overcome nutrient transport problems due to soil dryness.

AB Water stress and nitrogen (N) availability are the main constraints on barley ( Hordeum vulgare L.) yield in Mediterranean conditions. Here we studied the combined effects of N source and water regime (WR) on plant growth, photosynthesis and carbon isotope discrimination (Delta(13)C) in barley grown under controlled conditions. The effects of these conditions on plant N isotope discrimination against the fertiliser (Delta(15)N) was also examined to assess whether the natural variation in plant N isotope composition is a reliable indicator of N nutrition. Six experimental treatments were established with three nutrient solutions containing ammonium ( NH(4)(+p)), nitrate (NO(3)(-)) or a mixture of the two (NH(4)(+) : NO(3)(-)), each either well watered or moderately water stressed. The NH(4)(+) : NO(3)(-) treatment resulted in the greatest biomass accumulation and photosynthetic capacity in both WRs. The NH(4)(+) plants showed accelerated phenology and depressed growth. They also had the lowest photosynthetic rates in both WRs. This effect was mainly due to stomatal closure, while electron transport and carboxylation capacity of leaves were less affected. Consistent with lower stomatal conductance, leaf Delta(13)C was lower in plants that received NH(4)(+), indicating higher water use efficiency (WUE) not only when irrigated, but also under water stress. In addition, leaf Delta(13)C and photosynthetic N use efficiency (PNUE) correlated positively with each other and with shoot biomass in both WRs. However, NO(3)(-) treatment produced the greatest Delta(15)N, which was higher in leaves than in roots. Leaf Delta(15)N was decreased by water stress only in plants in the NO(3)(-) treatment. We conclude that leaf Delta(13)C is an adequate trait to assess the differences in growth, photosynthetic activity and WUE caused by distinct N sources. However, the usefulness of natural abundance of (15)N in plant tissue as a nitrogen source marker is restricted by the effect of WR and internal plant fractionation, at least for plants that received NO(3)(-).

AB 1. The net-winged midges (Diptera: Blephariceridae), with highly specific habitat requirements and specialised morphological adaptations, exhibit high habitat fidelity and a limited potential for dispersal. Given the longitudinal and hierarchical nature of lotic systems, along with the geological structure of catchment units, we hypothesise that populations of net-winged midge should exhibit a high degree of population sub-structuring.
   2. Sequence variation in the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) region of the mitochondrial DNA ( mtDNA) was examined to determine patterns of genetic variation and infer historical and contemporary processes important in the genetic structuring of populations of Elporia barnardi. The DNA variation was examined at sites within streams, between streams in the same range, and between mountain ranges in the south-western Cape of South Africa.
   3. Twenty-five haplotypes, 641 bp in length, were identified from the 93 individuals sampled. A neighbour-joining tree revealed two highly divergent clades (similar to5%) corresponding to populations from the two mountain ranges. A number of monophyletic groups were identified within each clade, associated with individual catchment units.
   4. The distribution of genetic variation was examined using analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA). This showed most of the variation to be distributed among the two ranges (similar to80%), with a small percentage (similar to15%) distributed among streams within each range. Similarly, variation among streams on Table Mountain was primarily distributed among catchment units (86%). A Mantel's test revealed a significant relationship between genetic differentiation and geographical distance, suggesting isolation by distance (P < 0.001).
   5. Levels of sequence divergence between the two major clades, representing the two mountain ranges, are comparable with those of some intra-generic species comparisons. Vicariant events, such as the isolation of the Peninsula mountain chain and Table Mountain, may have been important in the evolution of what is now a highly endemic fauna.
   6. The monophyletic nature of the catchment units suggests that dispersal is confined to the stream environment and that mountain ridges provide effective physical barriers to dispersal of E. barnardi.

AB The ray-finned fishes (Actinopterygii) seem to have two copies of many tetrapod (Sarcopterygii) genes. The origin of these duplicate fish genes is the subject of some controversy. One explanation for the existence of these extra fish genes could be an increase in the rate of independent gene duplications in fishes. Alternatively, gene duplicates in fish may have been formed in the ancestor of all or most Actinopterygii during a complete genome duplication event. A third possibility is that tetrapods have lost more genes than fish after gene or genome duplication events in the common ancestor of both lineages. These three hypotheses can be tested by phylogenetic reconstruction. Previously, we found that a large number of anciently duplicated genes of zebrafish are sister sequences in evolutionary trees suggesting that they were produced in Actinopterygii after the divergence of Sarcopterygii [Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B 356 (2001) 119]. On the other hand, several well-supported trees showed one of the two fish genes as the sister sequence to a monophyletic clade that included the second fish gene and genes from frog, chicken, mouse and human. These so-called outgroup topologies suggest that the origin of many fish duplicates predates the divergence of the Sarcopterygii and Actinopterygii and support the hypothesis that tetrapods have lost duplicates that have been retained in fish. Here we show that many of these 'outgroup' tree topologies are erroneous and can be corrected when mutational saturation is taken into account. To this end, a Java-based application has been developed to visualize the amount of saturation in amino acid sequences. The program graphically displays the number of observed frequent and rare amino acid replacements between pairs of sequences against their overall evolutionary distance. Discrimination between frequent and rare amino acid replacements is based on substitution probability matrices (e.g. PAM and BLOSUM). Evolutionary distances between sequences can be computed from the fraction of unsaturated sites only and evolutionary trees inferred by pairwise distance methods. When trees are computed by omitting the saturated fraction of sites, most fish duplicates are sister sequences. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Variation in dietary niche breadth among species is supposed to result from interactions within communities, but also from phylogenetic conservatism as well as constraints set by other traits. Here, we explore variation of dietary niche breadth across land birds occurring in Eastern Germany in correlation with phylogeny and traits like distributional range size, abundance, habitat range, body size, migratory behaviour and sexual dimorphism. First, we found a clear indication of phylogenetic conservatism: about half of the variation in dietary niche breadth across species was due to variation between families and genera. Habitat range, distributional range size of species in Eastern Germany and abundance did not correlate with dietary niche breadth. The significance of the correlation of dietary niche breadth with body size, distributional range size of species in Europe and plumage dichromatism depends on the details of the analyses. Nevertheless, even after controlling for phylogeny, we found robust correlations of dietary niche breadth versus migratory behaviour as well as sexual size dimorphism: species with a narrow dietary niche tend to be migratory and, in species with a broad dietary niche, males tend to be larger than females.

AB We develop, and discuss the implementation of, a mathematical framework for inferring optimal patterns of water and nitrogen use. Our analysis is limited to a time scale of one day and a spatial scale consisting of the green canopy of one plant, and we assume that this canopy has fixed quantities of nitrogen and water available for use in photosynthesis. The efficiencies of water and nitrogen use, and the interactions between the two, are strongly affected by physiological and physical properties that can be modeled in different ways. The thrust of this study is therefore to discuss these properties and how they affect the efficiencies of nitrogen and water use, and to demonstrate, qualitatively, the effects of different model assumptions on inferred optimal strategies. Preliminary simulations suggest that the linked optimisation of nitrogen and water use is particularly sensitive to the level of detail in canopy light penetration models (e.g., whether sunlit and shaded fractions are pooled or considered independently), and to assumptions regarding nitrogen and irradiance gradients within leaves (which determine how whole-leaf potential electron transport rate is calculated from leaf nitrogen content and incident irradiance).

AB Forest seedling demography and seedling diversity are commonly impacted by spatially variable microhabitat effects on germination and establishment. For many forests of the eastern United States. herbivory by white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) also can be intense and impose severe restrictions on seedling demography. The concurrent effects of these "bottom-up" and "top-down" factors were examined in a riparian forest on the Patuxent Research Refuge, Maryland. USA.
   Random permanent-plot surveys found that two microhabitat factors. soil moisture and leaf litter, were correlated with seedling spatial distributions. These correlations suggest that microhabitat variability promotes seedling diversity. Microhabitat effects due to codominant American beech (Fagus grandifolia) and yellow-poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera) canopies had limited impacts on seedling demography but were consistent with the random surveys. In contrast, experimental results show that browsing had distinct demographic effects on seedling populations and strong collective impacts at the community level. Although not completely overriding the importance of microhabitat effects. browsing may be viewed as a consistent and spatially ubiquitous top-down constraint on seedling populations.
   Four distinctive relationships between seedling density and species-specific browsing intensity were apparent: density-independence, density-dependence, avoidance, and opportunism. These species-specific relationships are related to browsing preference, palatability, and life-history traits of the tree species. In contrast, at the community level browsing on woody species is strictly density dependent and emerges as a consequence of cumulative species-specific patterns. Because of complementary species-specific browsing patterns and variation among cohorts of each species, browsing impacts at the community level were more clearly defined. These impacts included a 39% increase in annual seedling mortality rate. a 42% reduction in seedling recruitment. a 28% reduction in basal-diameter increment. and a 35% reduction in the rate of population increase.
   White-tailed deer browsing in this forest has the potential to decrease seedling diversity by impacting species differentially, offsetting the diversifying impact of microhabital variation, and suppressing total seedling density. Nonetheless, browsing may not alter the trajectory of forest succession from that expected based on life-history characteristics of the two dominant species because: (1) American beech is shade tolerant and only slightly impacted by browsing, (2) codominant yellow-poplar is shade intolerant and a preferred browse species, and (3) the primary understory species (spicebush [Lindera benzoin] and ironwood [Carpinits caroliniana]), although heavily browsed. are not suppressed by browsing. Microhabitat. browsing, and tree species life-history traits should be considered collectively in considering the current status and predicted future of this forest.

AB Leaf photosynthesis (Ps), nitrogen (N) and light environment were measured on Populus tremuloides trees in a developing canopy under free-air CO2 enrichment in Wisconsin, USA. After 2 years of growth, the trees averaged 1.5 and 1.6 in tall under ambient and elevated CO2, respectively, at the beginning of the study period in 1999. They grew to 2.6 and 2.9 in, respectively, by the end of the 1999 growing season. Daily integrated photon flux from cloud-free days (PPFDday,sat) around the lowermost branches was 16.8 +/- 0.8 and 8.7 +/- 0.2% of values at the top for the ambient and elevated CO2 canopies, respectively. Elevated CO2 significantly decreased leaf N on a mass, but not on an area, basis. N per unit leaf area was related linearly to PPFDday,sat throughout the canopies, and elevated CO2 did not affect that relationship. Leaf Ps light-response curves responded differently to elevated CO2, depending upon canopy position. Elevated CO2 increased Ps(sat) only in the upper (unshaded) canopy, whereas characteristics that would favour photosynthesis in shade were unaffected by elevated CO2. Consequently, estimated daily integrated Ps on cloud-free days (Ps(day,sat)) was stimulated by elevated CO2 only in the upper canopy. Ps(day,sat) of the lowermost branches was actually lower with elevated CO2 because of the darker light environment. The lack of CO2 stimulation at the mid- and lower canopy was probably related to significant down-regulation of photosynthetic capacity; there was no down-regulation of Ps in the upper canopy. The relationship between Ps(day,sat) and leaf N indicated that N was not optimally allocated within the canopy in a manner that would maximize whole-canopy Ps or photosynthetic N use efficiency. Elevated CO2 had no effect on the optimization of canopy N allocation.

AB . C-13 enrichment in emerging leaves and its effect on carbon isotopic composition (delta C-13) of mature leaves were investigated in the neotropical pioneer tree species, Cecropia longipes and Urera caracasana, in Panama. e .
   . Leaves of all ages were analysed for delta C-13, gas exchange, nitrogen, and leaf mass per area. Low intercellular to atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) partial pressure (pi: p); and high delta C-13 of Co in air, intrinsic water-use efficiency, internal resistance, and carboxylation capacity were discounted as causes of C-13 enrichment.
   . C-13 enrichment might occur when leaf growth is from imported organic carbon but might not reflect delta C-13 values at the leaf producing the carbon. Results support hypotheses that: de novo sucrose synthesis causes C-13 enrichment of mobile sugars after export from source leaves; and high ratios of PEP carboxylase (PEPc) : PEPc + Rubisco, cause emerging leaves to be C-13 enriched relative to their growth substrate. Carbon contributions of delta C-13-enriched early growth could yield inaccurate p(i) : p(a) estimates from delta C-13 in mature leaves.
   . A model estimated investment of imported organic carbon to leaf growth and improved estimates of pi : p(i):p(a) from mature leaves. With such adjustment, delta C-13 analyses provide valuable information about age-related source-sink relations in leaves.

AB This study explores the determinants of distribution, abundance and regeneration of six Pinus species (P. halepensis, P. nigra, P. pinaster, P. pinea, P. sylvestris and P. uncinata) that occur naturally in Catalonia, northeastern Spain. The aim of this study was to generate accurate predictions of the distribution of each species using simple and readily available environmental variables. We used recursive partitioning and GIS analyses to relate the data base of 10600 field plots from the Forestry Inventory of Catalonia with abiotic and biotic characteristics of each plot. We present general patterns of distribution, dominance and regeneration for the six species and then focus on P. halepensis, the most abundant pine species in the western Mediterranean Basin. For all six species, the models correctly classified more than 80% of the distribution using abiotic factors, mainly altitude and rainfall variability. Biotic factors such as the basal area of other pine species were necessary to accurately predict patterns of pine species dominance. Biotic factors, especially the basal area of evergreen species (mainly Quercus ilex), were of overriding importance when predicting patterns of seedling occurrence. Potentially important factors such as land use and fire history were of little significance for predicting distribution at the scale of our study. Our models failed to predict accurately which species (and in which numbers) co-occur with P. halepensis. Factors not included in this study, such as stand age, disturbance (cutting, clearing) and other human-induced factors, are probably the main determinants of co-existence patterns.

AB 1. The pattern of attack by the leaf-galling insect Neopelma baccharidis (Homoptera: Psyllidae) was studied in three populations of the dioecious shrub Baccharis dracunculifolia (Asteraceae) in south-eastern Brazil. The plant vigour hypothesis, which predicts higher rates of attack and increased herbivore performance on the longest plant shoots, was tested. This work also provides further information for the study of differential herbivory in dioecious plants.
   2. In total, 9200 shoots were collected randomly from 46 male and 47 female plants belonging to the three populations. Shoot length, number of leaves per shoot, rate of galling, and survival of psyllids did not differ between male and female plants. Another population on the Campus of the Federal University of Minas Gerais was used only to determine the pattern of shoot growth.
   3. The hypothesis of sex-mediated herbivory was not corroborated in this study.
   4. The frequency of galling increased with increasing shoot length, as predicted by the plant vigour hypothesis. Nevertheless, the number of oviposition sites (leaf buds) increased with shoot length.
   5. The performance of the galling herbivore was not related to shoot length in the plant populations studied.
   6. In conclusion, Neopelma baccharidis did not select shoots based on length only.

AB The genetic differentiation among kob populations (Kobus kob) representing two recognized subspecies was examined using mitochondrial control region sequences. Two distinct lineages (estimated sequence divergence of 9.8%) exhibited different geographical distributions and do not coincide with previously recognized ranges of subspecies. The presence of the two lineages was further supported with sequences of mitochondrial cytochrome b gene. One lineage was predominant in the west and southern ranges of the populations studied and the other was commonly found in a more northern distribution (Murchison populations) in Uganda. Murchison and the geographically intermediate Toro populations (Uganda) represented the area of overlap. The existence of the two lineages in the area of overlap is hypothesized to have resulted from a range expansion and secondary contact of the two lineages of kob that evolved in allopatry. The existence of the kob during the Pleistocene offers a plausible explanation for the observed biogeographic pattern. Our mitochondrial data reveal two examples of discordance between a gene tree and presumed species tree as: (i) the two lineages co-occur in the kob subspecies, Kobus kob thomasi (Uganda kob); and (ii) the puku, which was included in the analysis because of its controversial taxonomic status (currently recognized as a distinct species from the kob), is paraphyletic with respect to the kob. Significant degrees of heterogeneity were detected between populations. Relatively high genetic variation was observed in the populations, however, the inclusion of distinct lineages influences the population structure and nucleotide diversity of the kob populations.

AB Cladistic mechanics and ramifications of various species concepts rooted in phylogenetic theory are explored. Published discussions of the phylogenetic species concept (PSC) have been hampered by persistent misconceptions surrounding its ontology and applicability, and by confusion of various incompatible versions of species concepts claiming to follow from Hennig's (1966), Phylogenetic Systematics, Univ. of Illinois Press, Urbana work. Especially problematic are topology- or tree-based versions of species diagnosis, which render diagnoses dependent on relationships depicted as hierarchically structured regardless of any lack of underlying hierarchy. Because the applicability of concepts such as monophyly, paraphyly, and polyphyly rests ultimately on the underlying hierarchical distribution of characters, representations of tokogenetic or reticulating systems as nested hierarchies are necessarily inaccurate. And since hierarchical representations-even if accurate-of nonrecombining genetic elements need not coincide with the organisms that bear them, tree-based diagnoses are further hampered, except potentially as retrospective tools. The relationship between tree-based species delineations and the criterion of character fixation is explored. Fixation of characters by which one identifies phylogenetic species is further distinguished from the fixation of character state differences, and the implications of that distinction are explored with reference to the interpretation of speciation events. It is demonstrated that character fixation in alternative species need not coincide with the achievement of reciprocal monophyly. While the PSC retains shortcomings, some of the more frequently criticized aspects of the PSC are functions of sampling that are no more problematic than for any basic systematic endeavor.

AB Investigations of phylogenetic relationships using comparative morphological characters have led to the hypothesis that Ammocrypta is the sister taxon of the Etheostoma subgenus Ioa. Subsequent molecular analyses have not recovered this proposed relationship. In this investigation, variation in complete cytochrome b sequences sampled from 27 percid species, representing all darter genera and all species of Ammocrypta,, is examined in a phylogenetic context. Third codon purine transitions are saturated when all darter species examined are compared; however, saturation is not detected in any character class among species of Ammocrypta. Maximum-parsimony analysis, which excludes potentially homoplasious character classes, and maximum-likelihood analysis of cytochrome b sequences statistically reject the hypothesis that Ammocrypta is the sister taxon of the Etheostoma subgenus loa. Etheostoma is not recovered as monophyletic; however, the hypothesis of monophyly cannot be rejected using maximum-parsimony and maximum-likelihood methods. Morphological characters are combined with cytochrome b sequences in a total evidence analysis of relationships within Ammocrypta. A novel hypothesis of relationships is proposed, which includes a sister-taxon relationship between A. clara and A. pellucida. With regard to relationships among species of Ammocrypta, the morphological data do not significantly conflict with the cytochrome b data. Morphological characters provide additional synapomorphies supporting the hypothesis that A. beani and A. bifascia are sister taxa. The biogeographic implications of the total evidence analysis are discussed, and the continued taxonomic placement of Ammocrypta in Etheostoma is discouraged.

AB The Florida scrub lizard, Sceloporus woodi, is endemic to scrub habitat patches along the central portion of the Florida peninsula and xeric coastal regions. Scrub ecosystems are the patchily distributed remnants of previously widespread habitats formed during the Pleiocene and early Pleistocene. Scrub lizards appear to have limited dispersal capabilities due to high habitat specificity and low mobility. To assess the population structure and phylogeography of S. woodi, 135 samples were collected from 16 patches on five major ridges in Florida, USA. Analysis of 273 bp of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) cytochrome b reveals a very strong geographic distribution of genetic diversity. Haplotype frequencies are significantly different in 63 of 66 comparisons between patches. With one exception, samples from the five major ridges are characterized by fixed differences in haplotype distribution and deep evolutionary separations (3-10%). Fixed genetic differences were also observed between northern and southern segments of several ridges. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) shows an estimated 10.4% total genetic variation within patches, 17.5% among patches (within ridges), and 72.1% among ridges. This strong population structure among patches within ridges indicates that the distribution of S. woodi is tightly linked to sandy scrub habitat and that the discontinuous distribution of scrub habitats significantly inhibits dispersal and gene now. Phylogeographic analyses indicate a pattern of dispersal down the Florida peninsula during the late Pliocene-early Pleistocene, followed by habitat fragmentation and vicariant isolation events. Therefore, the deep genetic structuring among scrub lizard populations on separate ridges is attributed to ancient isolation events induced by a shift from dry (xeric) to wet (mesic) conditions on the Florida peninsula. These findings indicate that some scrub lizard populations have persisted in isolation for time frames in excess of 1 Myr, providing a case history on the genetic consequences of habitat fragmentation.

AB The genetic relationships among morphologically and geographically divergent populations of whitefish (genus: Coregonus) from Denmark and the Baltic Sea region were studied by analysis of microsatellites and polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) analysis of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) segments, The endangered North Sea houting (classified as C. oxyrhynchus) differs morphologically and physiologically from other Danish whitefish (C. lavaretus). However, limited divergence of North Sea houting was observed both at the level of mtDNA and microsatellites. The implications of these results for the conservation status of North Sea houting are discussed in the light of current definitions of evolutionary significant units. Both mtDNA and microsatellite data indicated that postglacial recolonization by C. lavaretus in Denmark was less likely to have taken place from the Baltic Sea. Instead, the data suggested a recent common origin of all Danish whitefish populations, including North Sea houting, probably by recolonization via the postglacial Elbe River system. Estimates of genetic differentiation among populations based on mtDNA and microsatellites were qualitatively different. In addition, for both classes of markers analyses of genetic differentiation yielded different results, depending on whether molecular distances between alleles or haplotypes were included.

AB Dietary habits of five common rodents in agroecosystems on the central Argentine Pampa were studied for 15 months using microhistological analysis of stomach contents. All five rodent species were omnivorous, but proportions of major dietary items (arthropods, dicot leaves and seeds, monocot leaves and seeds) varied among species and seasons. Akodon azarae largely was entomophagous; arthropods formed 41-62% of the diet in all seasons. The other four species (Calomys musculinus, Calomys laucha, Bolomys obscurus, and Oligoryzomys flavescens) consumed most diet items throughout the year, but relative proportions varied among seasons. Leaves formed a relatively minor proportion of the diet (12-16% overall for all species) throughout the year. All species except A. azarae consumed higher quantities of seeds (50-73% of stomach volume) than arthropods (15-35%) during autumn and winter but switched to higher quantities of arthropods (30-53%) in spring and summer. Diet breadth was narrower and overlap generally highest during winter when all species were forced to subsist on a reduced set of available resources. Of 28 plant species with >2% cover in the environment, 25 were identified in stomachs of one or more of the five rodent species. The most important plant species in the diet were corn and soybeans (mostly grain), seed of Johnson grass (Sorghum halepense), chickweed (Stellaria media), and Amaranthus. High consumption of arthropods, especially by A. azarae, contraindicates the broad-scale use of rodenticides until the role of that rodent species in the control of pest insects can be ascertained.

AB We explored the evolution of geographic distributions in archipelagos by comparing mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences and morphometric characters within and among conspecific populations of Adeiaide's Warbler (Dendroica adelaidae), Plumbeous Warbler (D. plumbea), and Olive-capped Warbler (D. pityophila). Phylogenetic reconstructions were based upon 1,455 nucleotides of protein-coding mtDNA sequence from 53 individual warblers; morphological analyses employed three external measurements from a larger number of museum specimens. Of the three taxa studied, Adeiaide's Warbler occupied the broadest and most fragmented geographical distribution and exhibited the greatest interpopulation differentiation in both mtDNA and morphology. Phylogenetic analyses demonstrated that the three Adeiaide's Warbler populations are each reciprocally monophyletic with the Puerto Rican lineage basal to sister clades on Barbuda and St. Lucia. Genetic distances among these populations were comparable with those between some continental species. In contrast to the mtDNA pattern, the Puerto Rican and Barbudan Adelaide's Warbler populations were most similar in morphometry. We observed considerably less mtDNA and morphometric differentiation among populations of the two species with more restricted and less fragmented distributions, the Plumbeous Warbler of Dominica and Guadeloupe and the Olive-capped Warbler of the Bahamas and Cuba. High levels of molecular and morphological differentiation among the geographically disjunct Adelaide's Warbler populations and low differentiation in the two species with less fragmented ranges suggest that range disjunctions indicate the long-term evolutionary independence of geographically isolated island populations.

AB Folivorous insect responses to elevated CO2-grown tree species may be complicated by phytochemical changes as leaves age. For example, young expanding leaves in tree species may be less affected by enriched CO2-alterations in leaf phytochemistry than older mature leaves due to shorter exposure times to elevated CO2 atmospheres. This, in turn, could result in different effects on early vs. late instar larvae of herbivorous insects. To address this, seedlings of white oak (Quercus alba L.), grown in open-top chambers under ambient and elevated CO2, were fed to two important early spring feeding herbivores; gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar L.), and forest tent caterpillar (Malacosoma disstria Hubner). Young, expanding leaves were presented to early instar larvae, and older fully expanded or mature leaves to late instar larvae. Young leaves had significantly lower leaf nitrogen content and significantly higher total nonstructural carbohydrate:nitrogen ratio as plant CO2 concentration rose, while nonstructural carbohydrates and total carbon-based phenolics were unaffected by plant CO2 treatment. These phytochemical changes contributed to a significant reduction in the growth rate of early instar gypsy moth larvae, while growth rates of forest tent caterpillar were unaffected. The differences in insect responses were attributed to an increase in the nitrogen utilization efficiency (NUE) of early instar forest tent caterpillar larvae feeding on elevated CO2-grown leaves, while early instar gypsy moth larval NUE remained unchanged among the treatments. Later instar larvae of both insect species experienced larger reductions in foliage quality on elevated CO2-grown leaves than earlier instars, as the carbohydrate:nitrogen ratio of leaves substantially increased. Despite this, neither insect species exhibited changes in growth or consumption rates between CO2 treatments in the later instar. An increase in NUE was apparently responsible for offsetting reduced foliar nitrogen for the late instar larvae of both species.

AB The abundance of many invertebrates with planktonic larval stages can be determined shortly after they reach the benthos. In this study, we quantified patterns of abundance and habitat utilization of early benthic phases of the American lobster Homarus americanus and the rock crab Cancer irroratus. These 2 decapods are among the most common and abundant macroinvertebrates in coastal zones of the Gulf of Maine, with similar densities of larger individuals. Settlement and early postsettlement survival indicate that lobsters are highly substrate-specific early in life, settling predominantly in cobble beds. Crabs appear to be less selective, setting both in cobble and sand. Cumulative settlement of crabs, inferred from weekly censuses over the summer, was an order of magnitude greater than that of lobsters over the same time period. However, only crabs showed significant postsettlement losses. Although the identity of specific predators is unknown, predator exclusion experiments and placement of vacant uninhabited nursery habitat suggested that post-settlement mortality rather than emigration was responsible for these losses. The selective habitat-seeking behavior and lower post-settlement mortality of lobsters is consistent with their lower fecundity and later onset of reproductive maturity. The patterns observed for crabs, however, suggest a different strategy which is more in accordance with their higher fecundity and earlier onset of maturity. It is possible that lower fecundity but greater per-egg investment, along with strict habitat selection at settlement and lower post-settlement mortality, allows adult lobster populations to equal adult populations of crabs. This occurs despite crabs being more fecund and less habitat-selective settlers but sustaining higher postsettlement mortality.

AB Assessments of population genetic structure and diversity can be of value in formulating management plans for threatened species. Using randomly amplified polymorphic DNA markers, we found evidence of significant genetic structure among black rat snakes (Elaphe obsoleta) sampled at three spatial scales. highly isolated (1500-1900 km apart) populations were strongly divergent (F-ST = 0.242-0.323), whereas populations more proximal (less than or equal to 465 km apart) although currently isolated, exhibited far less divergence (F-ST = 0.019). A considerable proportion (80%) of total genetic diversity was due to differences among individuals within populations, although differences among populations (8%) also wee significant. At the scale of sub-populations (local populations 15-50 km apart), differentiation was generally moderate (F-ST = 0.058). Our estimates of Nei's genetic distance for sub-populations (0.014) approximated (mean = 0.044) those obtained in other studies that have assessed differentiation between snake populations based on variation in allozymes. The majority (ca. 86%) of total genetic variance across five sub-populations was attributable to differences among individuals, although differences among sub-populations (ca. 13%) also were significant. We found little evidence of genetic structure (F-ST = 0.006) between pairs of hibernacula, our finest spatial scale (samples 1-2 km apart), if they were located in natural habitats. In contrast, a pair of hibernacula sampled in an urban area exhibited genetic structure equivalent to some sub-population differences (F-ST = 0.039), suggesting interrupted gene flow related to urban development. Our results have direct implications for ranking populations in terms of their conservation value and the genetic management of threatened snakes.

AB The ecology of a shallow-water benthic octopus (Octopus tetricus) in northeastern New Zealand was examined. Spatial and temporal patterns of abundance, habitat association, and shelter use were quantified. Octopus were abundant on the reef during summer, during which time females brooded eggs. Numbers declined rapidly at the end of summer. Octopus were not evenly distributed across sites, and were more abundant in patch reef habitats than in broken or flat reef habitats. The role of reefal factors in habitat selection, both abiotic and biotic, was examined using multiple regression and partial correlation analyses. Octopus were more abundant near the reef edge, and in areas with high numbers of small boulders. No relationships between octopus and potential reefal predators (eels) or reefal prey (crayfish) species were found. Soft-sediment bivalves occurred in the majority of shelter middens, suggesting that octopus were foraging over adjacent soft-sediments rather than on the rocky reef itself. The degree of shelter modification varied with habitat, sex, and brooding status. Shelters were more likely to be modified in patch reef habitats than in broken and flat reef habitats. Brooding females were more likely to modify their shelters than non-brooding females and males, and often completely barricaded shelter entrances. This study suggests that Octopus tetricus are associated with rocky reef habitats during the breeding season, while a considerable portion of their life may be spent in soft-sediment habitats.

AB The digestibilities of dry and organic matter, energy and nitrogen were determined for Haliotis rubra feeding on a range of monospecific algal diets. These digestibilities, in conjunction with total intakes, were used to estimate the daily intakes of nitrogen and energy of abalone feeding on those algal species used by Fleming (1995). These were then used to explain the growth rates, intakes and chemosensory preferences of abalone in that study.
   The chemosensory preferences of abalone were strongly related to the digestible nitrogen content of the algae and to a slightly lesser extent the nitrogen content of the algae, indicating the important role nitrogen plays in setting preferences in this abalone. The intakes of digestible nitrogen were significantly related to the growth rates of abalone, suggesting that nitrogen is a limiting nutrient to abalone growth, Thus, N. rubra selects those foods which maximise the intake of nitrogen and result in maximum growth rates.
   Energy does not appear to play a major role in setting abalone preference as the digestible energy contents of algae in this study (and in general) are similar and did not correlate with preference. The digestible nitrogen content was lowest in the 3 brown algae tested and digestibility was related to the polyphenolic content of the brown algae. This suggests that the low growth of H. rubra on these species results from the action of polyphenolic compounds, reducing nitrogen digestibility.

AB Root hydraulic conductivity (L(p)) and leaf osmotic potential at full turgor (Psi(pi,o)) were measured in young, drought-stressed and nonstressed peach (Prunus persica (L.) Batsch), olive (Olea europaea L.), citrumelo (Poncirus trifoliata Raf. x Citrus paradisi Macf.) and pistachio (Pistachia integerrima L.). Drought stress caused a 2.5- to 4.2-fold reduction in L(p), depending on species, but Psi(pi,o) was reduced only in citrumelo and olive leaves by 0.34 and 1.4 MPa, respectively. No differences existed in L(p) among species for nonstressed plants. A simple model linking L(p) to osmotic adjustment through leaf water potential (Psi) quantified the offsetting effects of reduced L(p) and osmotic adjustment on the hypothetical turgor pressure difference between drought-stressed and nonstressed plants (Delta Psi(p)). For olive, the 2.5-fold reduction in L(p) caused a linear decrease in Delta Psi(p), such that the effect of osmotic adjustment was totally negated at Psi = -3.2 MPa. Thus, no stomatal closure would be required to maintain higher turgor in drought-stressed olive plants than in nonstressed plants over their typical diurnal range of Psi (-0.6 to -2.0 MPa). For citrumelo, osmotic adjustment was offset by reduced L(p) at Psi = -0.9 MPa. Unlike olive, stomatal closure would be necessary to maintain higher turgor in drought-stressed citrumelo plants than in nonstressed plants over their typical diurnal range of Psi (0 to -1.5 MPa). Regardless of species or the magnitude of osmotic adjustment, my analysis suggests that a drought-induced reduction in L(p) reduces or eliminates turgor maintenance through osmotic adjustment.

AB Field studies were carried out over 2 years to determine the effect of age of white spruce (Picea glauca) leaves on the development of the spruce bud moth, Zeiraphera canadensis Mut. & Free. (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae). In both years developing buds remained suitable for first-instar larvae for only 4-5 days after bud burst, after which survivorship decreased significantly. Individuals that survived on flaring shoots were smaller than those placed on newly burst buds. Although leaf contents of water, nitrogen, and several minerals were inversely related to leaf age, only declines in N and P content were associated with the rapid change in host suitability. Differences in N and P contents were small, however, suggesting that the rapid decline in host suitability was also due to the influence of other, unmeasured factors. When larvae were placed on foliage of the same age, their survival was similar on trees in half-sib families with high or low susceptibility to Z canadensis. Thus, variations in susceptibility of white spruce to Z canadensis might be associated with differences in host-plant phenology but are not due to differences in nutritional quality. This study demonstrates that the phenological window for establishment of newly emerged folivores may be shorter than is commonly thought.

AB Vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (VAMF) can reduce plant stress resulting from nutrient deficiencies, drought, and other factors. he objective of this work was to measure the effect of soybean [Glycine mar (L.) Merr.] and grain sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] rotation and fertilization on plant response and VAMF root colonization and diversity, and relate effects to soil environment. Fertilizer treatments consisted of no fertilizer, N, and manure. Rooting densities correlated with previous crop, VAMF colonization, and soil NO3. Root colonization by VAMF was affected by previous crop, rooting density, N fertilization, soil P, and water-filled pore space. Root colonization by VAMF ranged from 93% at 15 cm to 15% at the 120-cm soil depth. Root density and VAMF colonization were least when soybean was grown the previous year and manure was applied. Root colonization by VAMF for control, N, and manure treatments were 54, 53, and 30%, respectively, for continuous soybean and 61, 55, and 44%, respectively, for soybean from rotation plots. Root colonization by VAMF for control, N, and manure treatments were 69, 59, and 54%, respectively, for continuous grain sorghum and 56, 48, and 31%, respectively, for grain sorghum from rotation plots. These agricultural soils contained a diverse mixture of 26 VAMF species, which is probably a major factor in the region's soil productivity. Plants stressed due to cropping system or fertilizer practice have greater VAMF colonization and VAMF activity. A diverse VAMF population could increase the ability of VAMF to respond to different stresses.

AB Greenhouse and growth chamber investigations were undertaken using selected Leucaena and Sesbania species to determine the extent of which root morphological characteristics and rhizosphere acid production could explain differences in mycorrhizal dependency of host plants.  Compared with the moderately to very highly mycorrhizal-dependent Leucaena species, the marginally to moderately dependent Sesbania species were characterized by higher root mass, higher root density, higher root surface area, higher root length, smaller root diameter, higher percentage of root hair incidence, higher shoot to root ratio, and higher total P uptake.  The two groups of species were not consistently different from each other with respect to mycorrhizal colonization level, root hair diameter, root hair length, P uptake per unit root surface area, and acid production in agar media.  A stepwise regression model in which mycorrhizal dependency (MD) was used as the dependent variable and root characteristics as independent variables suggested that root mass, root hair length, root diameter, root density, and root hair incidence were important determinants of MD, with root mass accounting for 65.5% of the variability.  The results suggest that differences in the mycorrhizal dependency of host species can be largely predicted from root characteristics data.

AB RuBisCO-catalyzed CO2 fixation is the main source of organic carbon in the biosphere. This enzyme is present in all domains of life in different forms (III, II, and I) and its origin goes back to 3500 Myr, when the atmosphere was anoxygenic. However, the RuBisCO active site also catalyzes oxygenation of ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate, therefore, the development of oxygenic photosynthesis and the subsequent oxygen-rich atmosphere promoted the appearance of CO2 concentrating mechanisms (CCMs) and/or the evolution of a more CO2-specific RuBisCO enzyme. The wide variability in RuBisCO kinetic traits of extant organisms reveals a history of adaptation to the prevailing CO2/O-2 concentrations and the thermal environment throughout evolution. Notable differences in the kinetic parameters are found among the different forms of RuBisCO, but the differences are also associated with the presence and type of CCMs within each form, indicative of co-evolution of RuBisCO and CCMs. Trade-offs between RuBisCO kinetic traits vary among the RuBisCO forms and also among phylogenetic groups within the same form. These results suggest that different biochemical and structural constraints have operated on each type of RuBisCO during evolution, probably reflecting different environmental selective pressures. In a similar way, variations in carbon isotopic fractionation of the enzyme point to significant differences in its relationship to the CO2 specificity among different RuBisCO forms. A deeper knowledge of the natural variability of RuBisCO catalytic traits and the chemical mechanism of RuBisCO carboxylation and oxygenation reactions raises the possibility of finding unrevealed landscapes in RuBisCO evolution.

AB In-vivo foliar spectroscopy, also known as contact hyperspectral reflectance, enables rapid and non-destructive characterization of plant physiological status. This can be used to assess pathogen impact on plant condition both prior to and after visual symptoms appear. Challenging this capacity is the fact that dead tissue yields relatively consistent changes in leaf optical properties, negatively impacting our ability to distinguish causal pathogen identity. Here, we used in-situ spectroscopy to detect and differentiate Phytophthora infestans (late blight) and Alternaria solani (early blight) on potato foliage over the course of disease development and explored non-destructive characterization of contrasting disease physiology. Phytophthora infestans, a hemibiotrophic pathogen, undergoes an obligate latent period of two-seven days before disease symptoms appear. In contrast, A. solani, a necrotrophic pathogen, causes symptoms to appear almost immediately when environmental conditions are conducive. We found that respective patterns of spectral change can be related to these differences in underlying disease physiology and their contrasting pathogen lifestyles. Hyperspectral measurements could distinguish both P. infestans-infected and A. solani-infected plants with greater than 80% accuracy two-four days before visible symptoms appeared. Individual disease development stages for each pathogen could be differentiated from respective controls with 89-95% accuracy. Notably, we could distinguish latent P. infestans infection from both latent and symptomatic A. solani infection with greater than 75% accuracy. Spectral features important for late blight detection shifted over the course of infection, whereas spectral features important for early blight detection remained consistent, reflecting their different respective pathogen biologies. Shortwave infrared wavelengths were important for differentiation between healthy and diseased, and between pathogen infections, both pre- and post-symptomatically. This proof-of-concept work supports the use of spectroscopic systems as precision agriculture tools for rapid and early disease detection and differentiation tools, and highlights the importance of careful consideration of underlying pathogen biology and disease physiology for crop disease remote sensing.

AB Rural development policies in many Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) member countries promote sustainable landscape management with the intention of providing multiple ecosystem services (ES). Yet, it remains unclear which ES benefits are perceived in different landscapes and by different people. We present an assessment of ES benefits perceived and mapped by residents (n = 2,301) across 13 multifunctional (deep rural to peri-urban) landscapes in Europe. We identify the most intensively perceived ES benefits, their spatial patterns, and the respondent and landscape characteristics that determine ES benefit perception. We find outdoor recreation, aesthetic values and social interactions are the key ES benefits at local scales. Settlement areas are ES benefit hotspots but many benefits are also related to forests, waters and mosaic landscapes. We find some ES benefits (e.g. culture and heritage values) are spatially clustered, while many others (e.g. aesthetic values) are dispersed. ES benefit perception is linked to people's relationship with and accessibility to a landscape. Our study discusses how a local perspective can contribute to the development of contextualized and socially acceptable policies for sustainable ES management. We also address conceptual confusion in ES framework and present argumentation regarding the links from services to benefits, and from benefits to different types of values.

AB Trait-based approaches are increasingly used to predict ecological consequences of climate change, yet seldom have solid links been established between plant traits and observed climate-driven community changes. Most analyses have focused on aboveground adult plant traits, but in warming and drying climates, root traits may be critical, and seedlings may be the vulnerable stage. Relationships of seedling and root traits to more commonly measured traits and ecological outcomes are poorly known. In an annual grassland where winter drought-induced seedling mortality is driving a long-term decline in native diversity, using a field experiment during the exceptionally dry winter of 2017-2018, we found that seedling mortality was higher and growth of seedlings and adults were lower in unwatered than watered sites. Mortality of unwatered seedlings was higher in species with shorter seedling roots, and also in species with the correlated traits of small seeds, high seedling specific leaf area (SLA), and tall seedlings. Adult traits varied along an axis from short-stature, high SLA and foliar N, and early flowering to the opposite values, and were only weakly correlated with seedling traits and seedling mortality. No evidence was found for adaptive plasticity, such as longer roots or lower SLA in unwatered plants. Among these species, constitutive variation in seedling root length explained most of the variation in survival of a highly vulnerable life stage under winter drought. Selective loss of species with high adult SLA, observed in this community and others under drought stress, may be the byproduct of other correlated traits.

AB Machine learning, an important branch of artificial intelligence, is increasingly being applied in sciences such as forest ecology. Here, we review and discuss three commonly used methods of machine learning (ML) including decision-tree learning, artificial neural network, and support vector machine and their applications in four different aspects of forest ecology over the last decade. These applications include: (i) species distribution models, (ii) carbon cycles, (iii) hazard assessment and prediction, and (iv) other applications in forest management. Although ML approaches are useful for classification, modeling, and prediction in forest ecology research, further expansion of ML technologies is limited by the lack of suitable data and the relatively "higher threshold" of applications. However, the combined use of multiple algorithms and improved communication and cooperation between ecological researchers and ML developers still present major challenges and tasks for the betterment of future ecological research. We suggest that future applications of ML in ecology will become an increasingly attractive tool for ecologists in the face of "big data" and that ecologists will gain access to more types of data such as sound and video in the near future, possibly opening new avenues of research in forest ecology.

AB Background: Vinasse, a by-product of sugarcane ethanol production, is recycled by sugarcane plantations as a fertilizer due to its rich nutrient content. However, the impacts of the chemical and microbial composition of vinasse on soil microbiome dynamics are unknown. Here, we evaluate the recovery of the native soil microbiome after multiple disturbances caused by the application of organic vinasse residue, inorganic nitrogen, or a combination of both during the sugarcane crop-growing season (389 days). Additionally, we evaluated the resistance of the resident soil microbial community to the vinasse microbiome.
   Results: Vinasse applied alone or 30 days prior to N resulted in similar changes in the soil microbial community. Furthermore, the impact of the application of vinasse together with N fertilizer on the soil microbial community differed from that of N fertilizer alone. Organic vinasse is a source of microbes, nutrients, and organic matter, and the combination of these factors drove the changes in the resident soil microbial community. However, these changes were restricted to a short period of time due to the capacity of the soil community to recover. The invasive bacteria present in the vinasse microbiome were unable to survive in the soil conditions and disappeared after 31 days, with the exception of the Acetobacteraceae (native in the soil) and Lactobacillaceae families.
   Conclusion: Our analysis showed that the resident soil microbial community was not resistant to vinasse and inorganic N application but was highly resilient.

AB Vitis L. (the grape genus) is the economically most important fruit crop, as the source of grapes and wine. Phylogenetic relationships within the genus have been highly controversial. Herein, we employ sequence data from whole plastomes to attempt to enhance Vitis phylogenetic resolution. The results support the New World Vitis subgenus Vitis as monophyletic. Within the clade, V. californica is sister to the remaining New World Vitis subgenus Vitis. Furthermore, within subgenus Vitis, a Eurasian clade is robustly supported and is sister to the New World clade. The clade of Vitis vinifera ssp. vinifera and V. vinifera ssp. sylvestris is sister to the core Asian clade of Vitis. Several widespread species in North America are found to be non-monophyletic in the plastome tree, for example, the broadly defined Vitis cinerea and V. aestivalis each needs to be split into several species. The non-monophyly of some species may also be due to common occurrences of hybridizations in North American Vitis. The classification of North American Vitis by Munson into nine series is discussed based on the phylogenetic results. Analyses of divergence times and lineage diversification support a rapid radiation of Vitis in North America beginning in the Neogene.

AB Although fine roots are essential for the water and nutrient uptake of plants, there is limited understanding of root trait variation and the underlying mechanism.
   Here, six first-order root morphological and chemical traits were measured for 181 species from eight subtropical and boreal forests to test the hypothesis of different phylogenetic and environmental regulations of root morphological and nutrient traits result in the multidimensions of root traits.
   Two independent root trait dimensions between root thickness and nutrient traits were detected at both species and community levels. At the species level, diameter-related traits were mainly restricted by phylogenetic structure and showed little plasticity to the changing environments, whereas the variation in woody root nutrient was influenced significantly by soil variables. For community-level traits, the diameter-related axis scores of principal component analysis were mainly driven by mean annual temperature through shifting species composition, whereas the root nutrient-related axis scores were strongly influenced by soil P availability.
   From both species and community levels, our study confirms, that the root-thickness-related dimension and root nutrient dimension represent new support for the multidimensionality of root traits which are driven by different selection pressure. This study also underlines that the community-aggregated traits might serve as a promising avenue to improve our understanding of community assemblage processes, allowing us to predict changes of vegetation distributions in a changing climate.

AB Changing frequencies of extreme weather events and shifting fire seasons call for enhanced capability to forecast where and when forested landscapes switch from a nonflammable (i.e., wet fuel) state to the highly flammable (i.e., dry fuel) state required for catastrophic forest fires. Current forest fire danger indices used in Europe, North America, and Australia rate potential fire behavior by combining numerical indices of fuel moisture content, potential rate of fire spread, and fire intensity. These numerical rating systems lack the physical basis required to reliably quantify forest flammability outside the environments of their development or under novel climate conditions. Here, we argue that exceedance of critical forest flammability thresholds is a prerequisite for major forest fires and therefore early warning systems should be based on a reliable prediction of fuel moisture content plus a regionally calibrated model of how forest fire activity responds to variation in fuel moisture content. We demonstrate the potential of this approach through a case study in Portugal. We use a physically based fuel moisture model with historical weather and fire records to identify critical fuel moisture thresholds for forest fire activity and then show that the catastrophic June 2017 forest fires in central Portugal erupted shortly after fuels in the region dried out to historically unprecedented levels.

AB Cyanobacterial blooms occur in lakes worldwide, producing toxins that pose a serious public health threat. Eutrophication caused by human activities and warmer temperatures both contribute to blooms, but it is still difficult to predict precisely when and where blooms will occur. One reason that prediction is so difficult is that blooms can be caused by different species or genera of cyanobacteria, which may interact with other bacteria and respond to a variety of environmental cues. Here we used a deep 16S amplicon sequencing approach to profile the bacterial community in eutrophic Lake Champlain over time, to characterise the composition and repeatability of cyanobacterial blooms, and to determine the potential for blooms to be predicted based on time course sequence data. Our analysis, based on 135 samples between 2006 and 2013, spans multiple bloom events. We found that bloom events significantly alter the bacterial community without reducing overall diversity, suggesting that a distinct microbial community-including non-cyanobacteria-prospers during the bloom. We also observed that the community changes cyclically over the course of a year, with a repeatable pattern from year to year. This suggests that, in principle, bloom events are predictable. We used probabilistic assemblages of OTUs to characterise the bloom-associated community, and to classify samples into bloom or non-bloom categories, achieving up to 92% classification accuracy (86% after excluding cyanobacterial sequences). Finally, using symbolic regression, we were able to predict the start date of a bloom with 78-92% accuracy (depending on the data used for model training), and found that sequence data was a better predictor than environmental variables.

AB Arboriculture must maintain acceptable fruit production levels while preserving natural resources. This duality can be analyzed with the concept of ecosystem service. We reviewed the literature on orchards to explain how ecological functions modified by agricultural practices provide six ecosystem services - fruit production, climate regulation, soil nitrogen availability, water regulation, pest and disease control, and pollination - and which indicators could describe them. The major points are, first, that orchards have a high potential of multiple services. They can sequester from 2.4 to 12.5 t C/ha/year. Their perennial character and multi-strata habitat, as well as the opportunity of creating diversified hedgerows and cover crops in alleys, may contribute to a high level of biodiversity and related services. Second, every service depends on many functions. Fruit yield, which could reach up to 140 t/ha in apple orchards, is increased by light interception, carbon allocation, and nitrogen and water uptake. Third, agricultural practices in orchards have a strong impact on ecosystem functions and, consequently, on ecosystem services. Overfertilization enhances nitrogen leaching, which reduces soil nitrogen availability for the plant and deteriorates the quality of drained water. Groundcover increases humification and reduces denitrification and runoff, thus enhancing soil nitrogen availability and water regulation. It also enhances biotic interactions responsible for pest control and pollination. Pruning may increase fruit quality trough a better carbon allocation but decreases pest control by fostering the dynamics of aphids.
   To study multiple ecosystem services in orchards, we suggest using models capable of simulating service profiles and their variation according to management scenarios. We then refer to the available literature to show that conflicts between provisioning and regulating services can be mitigated by agricultural practices. Improved knowledge of soil processes and carbon balance as well as new models that address multiple services are necessary to foster research on ecosystem service relationships in orchards.

AB Community-based Forestry (CBF) is now a popular approach for landscape restoration, forest management, biodiversity conservation and support for rural livelihoods worldwide. The Himalayan country Nepal has been at the forefront of CBF for over four decades, with almost 40% of the total population directly involved in protecting and managing more than 32% of the country's forested land. However, in the past, the focus of CBF in Nepal was the provision of goods for local subsistence, and there has been limited analysis of the role of CBF in providing ecosystem services (ES) from restored forest landscapes. Based on material drawn from a literature review and a stakeholders' workshop, this paper analyses changes in Nepalese forest policies to provide a more holistic framework for CBF that provides a wider range of ES and to potentially-underpin payments for ecosystem services in Nepal. The analysis indicates that Nepal's forest policy and practices are still dominated by a narrowly conceived notion of forest management that does not accommodate the holistic concept of ES. The study illustrates that CBF provides many ES from local to global benefits as result of forest restoration. For example, timber, firewood, food, and water have local importance, while climate regulation, flood/erosion control, and habitat improvement have global importance. Many innovative cases are emerging in the long journey of CBF in Nepal that demonstrate more diverse management strategies, new forms of tenure rights and autonomy in institutional spaces. These can potentially provide a catalytic platform for the wider adoption of the ES framework in CBF regimes, in order to focus and reward forest management more directly for the provision of services such as water, biodiversity, climate regulation and recreation. Consequently, this study discusses the issues and challenges that are impeding the implementation of the ES concept in Nepal and suggests some ways forward. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The Old World bollworm Helicoverpa armigera is now established in Brazil but efforts to identify incursion origin(s) and pathway(s) have met with limited success due to the patchiness of available data. Using international agricultural/horticultural commodity trade data and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) cytochrome oxidase I (COI) and cytochrome b (Cyt b) gene markers, we inferred the origins and incursion pathways into Brazil. We detected 20 mtDNA haplotypes from six Brazilian states, eight of which were new to our 97 global COI-Cyt b haplotype database. Direct sequence matches indicated five Brazilian haplotypes had Asian, African, and European origins. We identified 45 parsimoniously informative sites and multiple substitutions per site within the concatenated (945 bp) nucleotide dataset, implying that probabilistic phylogenetic analysis methods are needed. High diversity and signatures of uniquely shared haplotypes with diverse localities combined with the trade data suggested multiple incursions and introduction origins in Brazil. Increasing agricultural/horticultural trade activities between the Old and New Worlds represents a significant biosecurity risk factor. Identifying pest origins will enable resistance profiling that reflects countries of origin to be included when developing a resistance management strategy, while identifying incursion pathways will improve biosecurity protocols and risk analysis at biosecurity hotspots including national ports.

AB Climate change has consequences for terrestrial functioning, but predictions of plant responses remain uncertain because of the gaps in the representation of nutrient cycles and C-N-P interactions in ecosystem models. Here, we review the processes that are included in ecosystem models, but focus on coupled C-N-P cycle models. We highlight important plant adjustments to climate change, elevated atmospheric CO2, and/or nutrient limitations that are currently not-or only partially-incorporated in ecosystem models by reviewing experimental studies and compiling data. Plant adjustments concern C:N:P stoichiometry, photosynthetic capacity, nutrient resorption rates, allocation patterns, symbiotic N-2 fixation and root exudation (phosphatases, carboxylates) and the effect of root exudation on nutrient mobilization in the soil rhizosphere (P solubilization, biochemical mineralization of organic P and priming effect). We showed that several plant adjustments could be formulated and calibrated using existing experimental data in the literature. Finally, we proposed a roadmap for future research because improving ecosystem models necessitate specific data and collaborations between modelers and empiricists.

AB The relationships among drought, surface water flow, and groundwater recharge are not straightforward for most forest ecosystems due to the strong role that vegetation plays in the forest water balance. Hydrologic responses to drought can be either mitigated or exacerbated by forest vegetation depending upon vegetation water use and how forest population dynamics respond to drought. Understanding how drought impacts ecosystems requires understanding how drought impacts ecohydrological processes. Because different species and functional groups vary in their ecophysiological traits that influence water use patterns, changes in species assemblages can alter hydrological processes from the stand to the watershed scales. Recent warming trends and more prolonged and frequent droughts have accelerated the spread and intensity of insect attacks in the western US that kill nearly all of the canopy trees within forest stands, changing the energy balance of the land surface and affecting many hydrologic processes. In contrast, some eastern forest tree species and size classes can tolerate drought better than others, suggesting the potential for drought-mediated shifts in both species composition and structure. Predicting how these changes will impact hydrologic processes at larger spatial and temporal scales presents a considerable challenge. The biogeochemical consequences of drought, such as changes in stream chemistry, are closely linked to vegetation dynamics and hydrologic responses. As with other natural disturbances, droughts are difficult to prepare for because they are unpredictable. However, there are management options that may be implemented to minimize the impacts of drought on water quantity and quality. Examples include reducing leaf area by thinning and regenerating cut forests with species that consume less water, although a high level of uncertainty in both drought projections and anticipated responses suggests the need for monitoring and adaptive management.

AB Climate warming, one of the main features of global change, has exerted indelible impacts on the environment, among which the impact on the transport and fate of pollutants has aroused widespread concern. Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are a class of pollutants that are transported worldwide. Determining the impact of climate warming on the global cycling of POPs is important for understanding POP cycling processes and formulating relevant environmental policies. In this review, the main research findings in this field over the past ten years are summarized and the effects of climate warming on emissions, transport, storage, degradation and toxicity of POPs are reviewed. This review also summarizes the primary POP fate models and their application. Additionally, research gaps and future research directions are identified and suggested. Under the influence of climate change, global cycling of POPs mainly shows the following responses. (1) Global warming directly promotes the secondary emission of POPs; for example, temperature rise will cause POPs to be re-released from soils and oceans, and melting glaciers and permafrost can re-release POPs into freshwater ecosystems. (2) Global extreme weather events, such as droughts and floods, result in the redistribution of POPs through intense soil erosion. (3) The changes in atmospheric circulation and ocean currents have significantly influenced the global transport of POPs. (4) Climate warming has altered marine biological productivity, which has changed the POP storage capacity of the ocean. (5) Aquatic and terrestrial food-chain structures have undergone significant changes, which could lead to amplification of POP toxicity in ecosystems. (6) Overall, warming accelerates the POP volatilization process and increases the amount of POPs in the environment, although global warming facilitates their degradation at the same time. (7) Various models have predicted the future environmental behaviors of POPs. These models are used to assist governments in comprehensively considering the impact of global warming on the environmental fate of POPs and therefore controlling POPs effectively. Future studies should focus on the synergistic effects of global changes on the cycling of POPs. Additionally, the interactions among global carbon cycling, water cycling and POP cycling will be a new research direction for better understanding the adaptation of ecosystems to climate change.

AB It has long been recognized that leaf traits exert a crucial control on litter decomposition, a key process for nutrient cycling, and that invading species can greatly alter such soil processes via changes in mixed litter trait composition. Trait effects on ecosystem processes are hypothesized to operate via changes in either dominant trait values in the community (often calculated as community-weighted mean trait values; CWM) or trait functional diversity (dissimilarity between species trait values; FD). Few have studied the effects of these community trait components in tandem due to their interdependence. We studied litter mixture decomposition using three exotic and six native European tree species with a range in litter decomposability, to disentangle the unique and combined roles of CWM and FD in explaining net litter mixture mass loss. We showed that while CWM exerted the strongest effect on mass loss, FD modulated its effects, increasing mass loss in mixtures with low mean decomposability and decreasing mass loss in mixtures with high mean decomposability. Litter species identity and native/exotic status explained relatively little additional variation in mass loss after accounting for CWM and FD. We further showed that alterations to CWM and FD were more important than the replacement of a native species with an exotic counterpart in predicting mass loss.Synthesis: Our results indicate that the effect of adding an exotic or losing a native species on litter decomposition rate can be predicted from how a species alters both CWM and FD trait values. This supports the idea that the repercussions of exotic species on ecosystem processes depends on the extent that introduced species bear novel traits or trait values and so on how functionally dissimilar a species is compared to the existing species in the community.

AB Although more than half the world's river networks comprise channels that periodically cease to flow and dry [intermittent rivers (IRs)], river ecology was largely developed from and for perennial systems. Ecological knowledge of IRs is rapidly increasing, so there is a need to synthesise this knowledge and deepen ecological understanding. In this Special Issue, we bring together 13 papers spanning observational case studies, field and laboratory experiments and reviews to guide research and management in this productive field of freshwater science. We summarise new developments in IR ecology, identify research gaps and needs, and address how the study of IRs as highly dynamic ecosystems informs ecological understanding more broadly. This series of articles reveals that contemporary IR ecology is a multifaceted and maturing field of research at the interface between aquatic and terrestrial ecology. This research contributes to fresh water and general ecology by testing concepts across a range of topics, including disturbance ecology, metacommunity ecology and coupled aquatic-terrestrial ecosystems. Drying affects flow continuity through time and flow connectivity across longitudinal, lateral and vertical dimensions of space, which aligns well with the recent emphasis of mainstream ecology on meta-system perspectives. Although most articles here focus on the wet phase, there is growing interest in dry phases, and in the terrestrial vegetation and invertebrate assemblages living in and along IR channels. We encourage interdisciplinary studies on IRs to further blur the demarcation between aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems and develop more integrated perspectives. As a result of climate change and human modification of landscapes and waterways, flooding and drought are expected to become more extreme and widespread. Shifts in streamflow regimes from perennial to intermittent may exacerbate the duration and frequency of dry phases in IRs with serious implications for river ecosystems and the quality and diversity of services they provide.

AB Bats are the second-most species-rich mammal group numbering more than 1270 species globally. Our knowledge of their geographic distributions and diversity patterns however is very limited possibly the poorest among mammals mainly due to their nocturnal and volant life history, and challenging fieldwork conditions in the tropics where most bat species occur. This knowledge gap obscures the geographic extent of ecosystem services provided by bats (i.e. pollination, seed dispersal and insect control), translates into inefficient conservation policies, and restricts macroecological analyses to coarse spatial resolutions. In contrast to the currently prevailing method of estimating species distributions using expert-drawn range maps, correlative species distribution models (SDMs) can provide estimates at very fine spatial grains and largely account for widespread sample bias as well as the prevalent Wallacean shortfall in species occurrence data. Very few such studies have hitherto been published that cover a large and complete taxonomic group with fine resolution at continental extent. Using an unparalleled amount of occurrence data, the MaxEnt algorithm and tailored solutions to specific modelling challenges, we created SDMs for nearly all 250 African bat species to explore emerging diversity patterns at a resolution of 1 km(2). Predicted species richness generally increases towards the equator conforming to expectations. Within the tropical area of elevated richness, several pronounced richness peaks and lows stand out, hinting at a complex interplay of determining factors. Richness gradients are often steep, decreasing strongly away from streams, and especially so in savanna biomes. Species richness also seems positively associated with rugged terrain, in particular at lower elevations. Centres of endemism are found primarily at low latitudes near major elevational ranges. Overlap with hotspots of species richness is rather low, and confined to five or six topodiverse, relatively low lying areas between western Guinea and the East African coast. Several poorly sampled regions are identified that may represent rewarding future survey targets. Our results demonstrate the value of stacking SDMs to infer plausible continent-wide diversity gradients at a spatial resolution fine enough to directly inform conservation policies and to open up new avenues in macroecological research.

AB Although agricultural ecosystems can provide humans with a wide set of benefits agricultural production system management is mainly driven by food production. As a consequence, a need to ensure food security globally has been accompanied by a significant decline in the state of ecosystems. In order to reduce negative trade-offs and identify potential synergies it is necessary to improve our understanding of the relationships between various ecosystem services (ES) as well as the impacts of farm management on ES provision. We present a spatially explicit application that captures and quantifies ES trade-offs in the crop systems of Llanada Alavesa in the Basque Country. Our analysis presents a quantitative assessment of selected ES including crop yield, water supply and quality, climate regulation and air quality. The study is conducted using semantic meta-modeling, a technique that enables flexible integration of models to overcome the service-by-service modeling approach applied traditionally in ES assessment.

AB AimThe most common pathway for the movement of plant pests across borders is the horticultural trade in live plants, especially potted ornamentals. Soilborne pathogens, possibly alien and potentially invasive, have a higher possibility of surviving transportation and becoming established at their destination if they are carried in potted plants. The European Union (EU) has an open-door phytosanitary system, under which any plant that is not specifically regulated can be imported. Inspections are focussed on a small number of economically important plant pests and even then limited to visual examinations of the aerial parts of the plant. Inspections fail to detect regulated pests or others internal to the tissues, or in the soil, if plants appear asymptomatic, or if incipient symptoms are limited to the roots. Phytophthora, a soilborne pathogen universally infamous for its ruinous outbreaks, but poorly regulated in Europe, was chosen to illustrate the risk inherent in the nursery pathway. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the level of infestation by Phytophthora in ornamental plants largely traded to, from and within Europe.
   LocationEuropean Union.
   MethodsAs Phytophthora species are not easily isolated, a real-time PCR assay was developed, based on a genus-specific TaqMan MGB probe, to detect the pathogens in plant tissues or soil even when present at low concentrations, and before symptoms occurred. Phytophthora species were identified by isolation and sequencing of the ITS (internal transcribed spacer) region.
   ResultsPhytophthora was detected by qPCR in 87% of the tested pots and in 70% of the asymptomatic potted plants. Potted plants in soil carried several Phytophthora species without showing any external symptoms.
   Main conclusionsThe results of this study strongly support the case for more rigorous European legislation on the trade of live plants in pots. As eradication of soilborne organisms is difficult, if not impossible, an embargo on plant movements into the EU and between member states is the only advisable measure against the spread of these pathogens.

AB Understanding how the interactions between anthropogenic and biophysical factors control fire regimes is increasingly becoming a major concern in a context of climate, economic and social changes. On a short time scale, fire activity is mainly driven by the variations in weather conditions. But while the assessment of this fire-weather relationship is an essential step towards fire hazard estimations, reconstructions or projections, still little is known about the impact of human practices on this relationship. In this study, we examined the recent fire history in southern France where a new fire policy, introduced during the 1980s, suddenly brought new fire suppression and prevention practices. We aimed at assessing the impact of these changes on fire activity and on the relationships between fire and weather, usually assumed to be constant over time. To do so, we used a statistical framework based on spatially explicit daily fire occurrence data, the corresponding weather variables and the associated fuel moisture derived from a process-based model. Our results showed that the introduction of the new fire policy resulted in a sharp decrease in fire activity but also impacted the daily fire-weather relationship in two main ways. On the one hand, fewer wildfires ignited for similar weather conditions. On the other hand, the probability of a fire to spread over significant surfaces shifted from a fuel-dryness driven system to a system driven by the concomitance of fuel dryness and strong winds. These observations suggest that mid-term (decadal) social factors can affect the short-term (seasonal to daily) relationship between weather conditions and fire activity. Thus, the interactions between human and climate factors should be taken into account when reconstructing or projecting fire activity and including the impact of fire policies on the fire-weather relationships in fire models would be an important step towards more realistic fire regimes simulations.

AB Climate change is expected to modify plant assemblages in ways that will have major consequences for ecosystem functions. How climate change will affect community composition will depend on how individual species respond, which is likely related to interspecific differences in functional traits. The extraordinary plasticity of some plant traits is typically neglected in assessing how climate change will affect different species. In the Mongolian steppe, we examined whether leaf functional traits under ambient conditions and whether plasticity in these traits under altered climate could explain climate-induced biomass responses in 12 co-occurring plant species. We experimentally created three probable climate change scenarios and used a model selection procedure to determine the set of baseline traits or plasticity values that best explained biomass response. Under all climate change scenarios, plasticity for at least one leaf trait correlated with change in species performance, while functional leaf-trait values in ambient conditions did not. We demonstrate that trait plasticity could play a critical role in vulnerability of species to a rapidly changing environment. Plasticity should be considered when examining how climate change will affect plant performance, species' niche spaces, and ecological processes that depend on plant community composition.

AB Many studies have focused on the impacts of climate change on biological assemblages, yet little is known about how climate interacts with other major anthropogenic influences on biodiversity, such as habitat disturbance. Using a unique global database of 1128 local ant assemblages, we examined whether climate mediates the effects of habitat disturbance on assemblage structure at a global scale. Species richness and evenness were associated positively with temperature, and negatively with disturbance. However, the interaction among temperature, precipitation and disturbance shaped species richness and evenness. The effect was manifested through a failure of species richness to increase substantially with temperature in transformed habitats at low precipitation. At low precipitation levels, evenness increased with temperature in undisturbed sites, peaked at medium temperatures in disturbed sites and remained low in transformed sites. In warmer climates with lower rainfall, the effects of increasing disturbance on species richness and evenness were akin to decreases in temperature of up to 9 degrees C. Anthropogenic disturbance and ongoing climate change may interact in complicated ways to shape the structure of assemblages, with hot, arid environments likely to be at greatest risk.

AB Prescribed burning as a fuel treatment seeks to moderate wildfire impacts and decreases the areal extent of wildfires by increasing the effectiveness of fire suppression. Assessment of prescribed burning effectiveness is frequently anecdotal or based on simulation. This paper examines recent observational evidence of prescribed fire effectiveness. The spread rate and intensity of experimental fires in distinct fuel types have been shown to increase with time since treatment (fuel age) following fuel structure recovery. Prescribed fire constrains the size and especially the severity of individual fires, even under extremely severe weather conditions. At larger spatial and temporal scales of analysis, the effect of fuel age on unplanned fire severity is also evident, whether it comes from wildfires entering treated areas or from wildfires in fuel-reduced areas resulting from earlier wildfire occurrences. The persistence of these effects is variable, depending on vegetation type and productivity. The long-term reduction in wildfire area brought about by prescribed fire can be difficult to ascertain. Substantial effort (annual treatment rates >5 % of the landscape) has been shown to effectively control the extent of wildfires in forests, with 3-4 units of prescribed burning needed to reduce wildfire by one unit. Future studies should consider the decrease in area burned by high-severity fire as a more meaningful and objective measure of prescribed fire effectiveness than the decrease in wildfire area and should strive to document fire behaviour in treated versus untreated areas during wildfires.

AB The Highway Safety Manual (HSM) recommends using the empirical Bayes (EB) method with locally derived calibration factors to predict an agency's safety performance. However, the data needs for deriving these local calibration factors are significant, requiring very detailed roadway characteristics information. Many of the data variables identified in the HSM are currently unavailable in the states' databases. Moreover, the process of collecting and maintaining all the HSM data variables is cost-prohibitive. Prioritization of the variables based on their impact on crash predictions would, therefore, help to identify influential variables for which data could be collected and maintained for continued updates. This study aims to determine the impact of each independent variable identified in the HSM on crash predictions. A relatively recent data mining approach called boosted regression trees (BRT) is used to investigate the association between the variables and crash predictions. The BRT method can effectively handle different types of predictor variables, identify very complex and non-linear association among variables, and compute variable importance. Five years of crash data from 2008 to 2012 on two urban and suburban facility types, two-lane undivided arterials and four-lane divided arterials, were analyzed for estimating the influence of variables on crash predictions. Variables were found to exhibit non-linear and sometimes complex relationship to predicted crash counts. In addition, only a few variables were found to explain most of the variation in the crash data. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Methods to assess ecosystem services using ecological or economic approaches are considerably better defined than methods for the social approach. To identify why the social approach remains unclear, we reviewed current trends in the literature. We found two main reasons: (i) the cultural ecosystem services are usually used to represent the whole social approach, and (ii) the economic valuation based on social preferences is typically included in the social approach. Next, we proposed a framework for the social valuation of ecosystem services that provides alternatives to economics methods, enables comparison across studies, and supports decision-making in land planning and management. The framework includes the agreements emerged from the review, such as considering spatial-temporal flows, including stakeholders from all social ranges, and using two complementary methods to value ecosystem services. Finally, we provided practical recommendations learned from the application of the proposed framework in a case study.

AB In spite of increasing recognition that intraspecific variation may play an important role for niche differentiation, which is regarded as a promoter of species coexistence, the extent and structure of functional trait variation in response to plant neighbor diversity is poorly understood. We studied the plasticity of functional traits in vegetative and reproductive shoots of 27 non-legume forb species with different growth forms (reptant, rosulate, semirosulate) in experimental grasslands (Jena Experiment) of varying species richness and functional group composition (with and without legumes). Traits related to whole-shoot structure differed strongly among forb species with different growth forms, while leaf traits associated with light acquisition (specific leaf area, foliar delta C-13 values) and traits associated with nitrogen nutrition (shoot biomass:N ratios, leaf nitrogen concentrations, foliar delta N-15 values) were highly plastic within forb species. Plant height generally increased with increasing species richness. Plasticities to increased species richness in leaf traits (leaf length, SLA, foliar delta C-13) varied among growth forms and depended on developmental stage. The presence of legumes generally increased plastic responses in light-acquisition traits in the same direction as increasing species richness. Greater tissue nitrogen concentrations and unchanged foliar delta N-15 values of forb species in the presence of legumes suggested that the fertilizing effect of nitrogen-fixing legumes was due to the supply of unconsumed mineral nitrogen. Stronger correlations between trait means and trait plasticities in size-related traits suggested a functional convergence in response to light competition. A more variable spectrum in the plasticities of traits not associated with plant size indicated a greater functional separation among species. Our results suggest that both interspecific differences and intraspecific trait plasticity affect niche partitioning among forb species and are important for their coexistence in multi-species assemblages.

AB The cyanobacterial diversity of soils of the Atacama Desert (Chile) was investigated using 16S rRNA gene cloning/sequencing directly from soil samples and 16S rRNA gene sequencing from unialgal cultures. Within the hyper-arid Atacama Desert, one of the driest parts of the world, 10 sites with differing altitude and distance to the shore were sampled along a total air-line distance (from south to north) of similar to 1,100km. Filamentous cyanobacteria belonging to Nostocophycideae and Synechococcophycideae were present. Oscillatoriophycideae exhibited the highest species richness among the subclasses of cyanobacteria, and included mostly filamentous species along with some coccoids (e.g., Chroococcidiopsis). Thirty species-level phylotypes could be recognized using a cut-off of 99% 16S rRNA sequence similarity within the 22 genera defined at 97% 16S rRNA sequence similarity. Eight of the 30 taxa could be detected by both clonal and culture sequences. Five taxa were observed only in cultures, whereas the cloning approach revealed 17 additional taxa, which might be in the collection but unsequenced, hard-to-cultivate, or entirely unculturable species using standard cultivation media. The Atacama Desert soils have a high diversity of phylotypes, among which are likely both new genera and new species awaiting characterization and description.

AB Cities are complex systems of accumulated matter. The continuous process of matter accumulation in urban systems differs in intensity across the globe according to specific urban features, such as location and age of the urban tissue, and as a physical manifestation of metabolic lineaments, material accumulation should differ amongst cities. In this paper, a new indicator to measure this process of material accumulation is proposed, namely, the Technomass. Emulating ecology, which measures biomass in natural ecosystems, a sample of different urban tissues in a given city - Bogota - was measured in terms of volume and rates of matter accumulation. Technomass is able to indicate overall asymptotic behaviour, specific spatial profiles and intensification of rates in time. In metabolic terms, the indicator looks into the black box, providing the possibility to link metabolic behaviours with urban form and attempting to fill the gap between urban planning, urban metabolism (UM) and Material Flow Analysis (MFA). This new indicator offers a broad scope of applications. Further possibilities and links to urban research and policy making are explored in the discussion section. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Much of the world is experiencing fast urbanization. Many pen-urban open spaces, such as parks, forest, farmland, and wetlands, have been built over, which has resulted in a steep decline of ecosystem services at the municipal and regional levels. Using remote sensing, geography information system (GIS) technology and economic evaluation method for ecosystem services, the evolution of landscape spatial structure in 1991, 1996, 2001 and 2006 of Changzhou City, People's Republic of China, was obtained and the change of ecosystem services resulted from land use change was evaluated. Study results show a continuing expansion of urbanized areas and reduction in ecosystem services. Before 2001, farmland was the main type of land use, accounting for more than 53.3% of the total area within the broadly-drawn municipal boundaries. In 2006, farmland and built-up areas were the main land-use types. The built-up area increased by 122% from 1991 to 2006. From 1991 to 2001, the proportion of ecological land (farmland, forests, grasslands, and water-covered areas) within Changzhou's municipal boundaries decreased 24.1%. Based on the observed changes, the economic value of ecosystem services provided by Changzhou's ecological land decreased by 19.3% from 1991 to 2006 and the annual decrease ratio was approximately 1.3%. Conversion of farmland to other uses was responsible for the largest reduction in the value of ecosystem services, equal to 239.8 million RMB (equivalent to USD 37.8 million). Our research results were already adopted locally by Changzhou Municipal Bureau of Urban Planning and applied for Changzhou Mater Urban Planning. The current study can contribute not only to improvements in the Changzhou environment, but to the study of and improvements to other rapidly-urbanizing cities, as the rapid growth of urban areas is one of the most pronounced environmental trends of recent times.

AB Long implicated in the invasion process, live-bait anglers are highly mobile species vectors with frequent overland transport of fishes. To test hypotheses about the role of anglers in propagule transport, we developed a social-ecological model quantifying the opportunity for species transport beyond the invaded range resulting from bycatch during commercial bait operations, incidental transport, and release to lake ecosystems by anglers. We combined a gravity model with a stochastic, agent-based simulation, representing a 1-yr iteration of live-bait angling and the dynamics of propagule transport at fine spatiotemporal scales (i.e., probability of introducing n propagules per lake per year). A baseline scenario involving round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) indicated that most angling trips were benign; irrespective of lake visitation, anglers failed to purchase and transport propagules (benign trips, median probability P = 0.99912). However, given the large number of probability trials (4.2 million live-bait angling events per year), even the rarest sequence of events (uptake, movement, and deposition of propagules) is anticipated to occur. Risky trips (modal P = 0.00088 trips per year; approximate to 1 in 1136) were sufficient to introduce a substantial number of propagules (modal values, Poisson model = 3715 propagules among 1288 lakes per year; zero-inflated negative binomial model = 6722 propagules among 1292 lakes per year). Two patterns of lake-specific introduction risk emerged. Large lakes supporting substantial angling activity experienced propagule pressure likely to surpass demographic barriers to establishment (top 2.5% of lakes with modal outcomes of five to 76 propagules per year; 303 high-risk lakes with three or more propagules per year). Small or remote lakes were less likely to receive propagules; however, most risk distributions were leptokurtic with a long right tail, indicating the rare occurrence of high propagule loads to most waterbodies. Infestation simulations indicated that the number of high-risk waterbodies could be as great as 1318 (zero-inflated negative binomial), whereas a 90% reduction in bycatch from baseline would reduce the modal number of high risk lakes to zero. Results indicate that the combination of invasive bycatch and live-bait anglers warrants management concern as a species vector, but that risk is confined to a subset of individuals and recipient sites that may be effectively managed with targeted strategies.

AB Crop pests and pathogens pose a significant and growing threat to food security, but their geographical distributions are poorly understood. We present a global analysis of pest and pathogen distributions, to determine the roles of socioeconomic and biophysical factors in determining pest diversity, controlling for variation in observational capacity among countries. Known distributions of 1901 pests and pathogens were obtained from CABI. Linear models were used to partition the variation in pest species per country amongst predictors. Reported pest numbers increased with per capita gross domestic product (GDP), research expenditure and research capacity, and the influence of economics was greater in micro-organisms than in arthropods. Total crop production and crop diversity were the strongest physical predictors of pest numbers per country, but trade and tourism were insignificant once other factors were controlled. Islands reported more pests than mainland countries, but no latitudinal gradient in species richness was evident. Country wealth is likely to be a strong indicator of observational capacity, not just trade flow, as has been interpreted in invasive species studies. If every country had US levels of per capita GDP, then 205 +/- 9 additional pests per country would be reported, suggesting that enhanced investment in pest observations will reveal the hidden threat of crop pests and pathogens.

AB Climate change is anticipated to alter plant species distributions. Regional context, notably the spatial complexity of climatic gradients, may influence species migration potential. While high-elevation species may benefit from steep climate gradients in mountain regions, their persistence may be threatened by limited suitable habitat as land area decreases with elevation. To untangle these apparently contradictory predictions for mountainous regions, we evaluated the climatic suitability of four coniferous forest tree species of the western United States based on species distribution modeling (SDM) and examined changes in climatically suitable areas under predicted climate change. We used forest structural information relating to tree species dominance, productivity, and demography from an extensive forest inventory system to assess the strength of inferences made with a SDM approach. We found that tree species dominance, productivity, and recruitment were highest where climatic suitability (i.e., probability of species occurrence under certain climate conditions) was high, supporting the use of predicted climatic suitability in examining species risk to climate change. By predicting changes in climatic suitability over the next century, we found that climatic suitability will likely decline, both in areas currently occupied by each tree species and in nearby unoccupied areas to which species might migrate in the future. These trends were most dramatic for high elevation species. Climatic changes predicted over the next century will dramatically reduce climatically suitable areas for high-elevation tree species while a lower elevation species, Pinus ponderosa, will be well positioned to shift upslope across the region. Reductions in suitable area for high-elevation species imply that even unlimited migration would be insufficient to offset predicted habitat loss, underscoring the vulnerability of these high-elevation species to climatic changes.

AB As the field of phylogeography has matured, it has become clear that analyses of one or a few genes may reveal more about the history of those genes than the populations and species that are the targets of study. To alleviate these concerns, the discipline has moved towards larger analyses of more individuals and more genes, although little attention has been paid to the qualitative or quantitative gains that such increases in scale and scope may yield. Here, we increase the number of individuals and markers by an order of magnitude over previously published work to comprehensively assess the phylogeographical history of a well-studied declining species, the western pond turtle (Emys marmorata). We present a new analysis of 89 independent nuclear SNP markers and one mitochondrial gene sequence scored for rangewide sampling of >900 individuals, and compare these to smaller-scale, rangewide genetic and morphological analyses. Our enlarged SNP data fundamentally revise our understanding of evolutionary history for this lineage. Our results indicate that the gains from greatly increasing both the number of markers and individuals are substantial and worth the effort, particularly for species of high conservation concern such as the pond turtle, where accurate assessments of population history are a prerequisite for effective management.

AB Narrow endemics constitute the cornerstone of Mediterranean plant diversity. Naufraga balearica (Apiaceae) is a critically endangered, extremely narrow endemic plant from the western Mediterranean island of Majorca. Because the species belongs to a monotypic genus, N. balearica was hypothesized to be a palaeoendemism. Here we conducted phylogenetic dating, population genetic and climatic niche analyses in order to understand the evolutionary history and conservation perspectives of this flagship species. Phylogenetic dating analysis of nuclear and plastid DNA sequences revealed a late Miocene to early Pliocene divergence between Naufraga and its sister genus Apium, supporting the palaeoendemic status of the former. Amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers and plastid DNA sequences of the five Naufraga populations revealed moderate genetic diversity. This diversity is in line with that of other palaeoendemisms from western Mediterranean islands, as revealed by a comparison with 22 other narrow endemic species from this region. Despite the fact that all Naufraga populations are located at a maximum distance of 10 km in a straight line, a strikingly strong population differentiation was found for AFLP markers, which is explained by long-term isolation likely related to short-range pollination and dispersal strategies of the species. While the species is not genetically impoverished, species distribution modelling and microclimatic monitoring revealed that narrow ecological requirements underlie the current extreme rarity of Naufraga and may jeopardize its long-term survival. Our results indicate that a multidisciplinary approach provides powerful tools to develop conservation strategies for evolutionarily singular lineages.

AB Ecosystem services (ES) and ecosystem services assessment (ESA) have become common parlance in the environmental field. Scientists, policy-makers and activists have promoted the ES approach as a means of conveying the extent of threats to natural ecosystems with the goal of crafting socially acceptable and effective policy to address ecological threats and biodiversity conservation. Yet there are some significant challenges to wide acceptance of the ES approach which hinder its absorption into the mainstream geography literature. This paper reviews the historical development of the ES approach focusing on its relevance to applied geography at different stages of its development, describes the present state-of-the-art of ES, and synthesizes the results from several seminal papers and reports. I posit that there are two major stumbling blocks: 1) the difficulty of simplifying complexities between services so that statutory planning processes can incorporate the approach, and 2) the lack of cross-landscape assessment methods and examples. If we focus on the most immediately surmountable challenges to the ES approach much progress could be made in a short time. The subsequent and final substantive section of this review summaries these challenges and offers some suggestions for moving forward. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID ABUNDANCE
AB Species distribution models (SDMs) are an important tool for studying the patterns of species across environmental and geographic space. For community data, a common approach involves fitting an SDM to each species separately, although the large number of models makes interpretation difficult and fails to exploit any similarities between individual species responses. A recently proposed alternative that can potentially overcome these difficulties is species archetype models (SAMs), a model-based approach that clusters species based on their environmental response. In this paper, we compare the predictive performance of SAMs against separate SDMs using a number of multi-species data sets. Results show that SAMs improve model accuracy and discriminatory capacity compared to separate SDMs. This is achieved by borrowing strength from common species having higher information content. Moreover, the improvement increases as the species become rarer.

AB Identifying local adaptation is crucial in conservation biology to define ecotypes and establish management guidelines. Local adaptation is often inferred from the detection of loci showing a high differentiation between populations, the so-called FST outliers. Methods of detection of loci under selection are reputed to be robust in most spatial population models. However, using simulations we showed that FST outlier tests provided a high rate of false-positives (up to 60%) in fractal environments such as river networks. Surprisingly, the number of sampled demes was correlated with parameters of population genetic structure, such as the variance of FSTs, and hence strongly influenced the rate of outliers. This unappreciated property of river networks therefore needs to be accounted for in genetic studies on adaptation and conservation of river organisms.

AB Eutrophication is perhaps the most pervasive form of pollution. Here we first review its effects on lake ecosystems based largely on modern ecological investigation. The longer time scale afforded by palaeolimnological investigation has seen an increase in the number of the publications since 1990 with a disproportionate increase in citations demonstrating the increasing use and usefulness of palaeolimnology to help understand lakes ecosystems and their response to eutrophication. We summarise briefly the history and origins of palaeolimnological investigation into eutrophication and its impacts in lakes. Then we review quantitative and qualitative palaeolimnological methods for tracking change in nutrient concentrations, algal community and abundance, macrophyte community composition and abundance and zooplanktivorous fish density. The usefulness of stable isotope analysis on sediment organic matter to track eutrophication is assessed and alternative methods discussed. A current challenge is to determine the effects of recent climate change on lake ecosystems. The impacts of climate change and eutrophication on the ecology of lakes have many similarities making it difficult to disentangle the impact of one from the other, in particular where the eutrophication impacts are greatest. We review a number of recent palaeolimnological studies, in particular those integrating long term monitoring data, which have gone some way to identifying when nutrients or climate may be having the greatest impact. Finally, we discuss possible future directions for the discipline, such as the greater integration of studies of evolutionary change using molecular techniques.

AB The strengths of environmental drivers and biotic interactions are expected to show large variability across organism groups. We tested two ideas related to the degree of ecological determinism vs. stochasticity using a large data set comprising bacterio-, phyto-, and zooplankton. We expected that (1) there are predictable, size-driven differences in the degree to which planktonic taxa respond to different drivers such as water chemistry, biotic interactions, and climatic variables; and (2) species distribution models show lowest predictive performance for the smallest taxa due to the stochastic distributions of microbes. Generalized linear models (GLMs), generalized additive models (GAMs), and generalized boosted methods (GBMs) were constructed for 84 species to model their occurrence as a function of eight predictors. Predictive performance was measured as the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver-operating characteristic plot and true skill statistic (TSS) using independent model evaluation data. We found that the model performances were typically remarkably low for all planktonic groups. The proportion of satisfactory models (AUC > 0.7) was lowest for bacteria (11.1% of the models), followed by phyto- (24.2%) and zooplankton (38.1%). The occurrences of taxa within all planktonic groups were related to climatic variables to a certain degree, but bacteria showed the strongest associations with the climatic variables. Moreover, zooplankton occurrences were more related to biotic variables than the occurrences of smaller taxa, while phytoplankton occurrences were more related to water chemistry. We conclude that the occurrences of planktonic taxa are highly unpredictable and that stochasticity in occurrences is negatively related to the organism size perhaps due to efficient dispersal and fast population dynamics among the smallest taxa.

AB Dispersal on the landscape/seascape scale may lead to complex spatial population structure with non-synchronous demography and genetic divergence. In this study we present a novel approach to identify subpopulations and dispersal barriers based on estimates of dispersal probabilities on the landscape scale. A theoretical framework is presented where the landscape connectivity matrix is analyzed for clusters as a signature of partially isolated subpopulations. Identification of subpopulations is formulated as a minimization problem with a tuneable penalty term that makes it possible to generate population subdivisions with varying degree of dispersal restrictions. We show that this approach produces superior results compared to alternative standard methods. We apply this theory to a dataset of modeled dispersal probabilities for a sessile marine invertebrate with free-swimming larvae in the Baltic Sea. For a range of critical connectivities we produce a hierarchical partitioning into subpopulations spanning dispersal probabilities that are typical for both genetic divergence and demographic independence. The mapping of subpopulations suggests that the Baltic Sea includes a fine-scale (100600 km) mosaic of invisible dispersal barriers. An analysis of the present network of marine protected areas reveal that protection is very unevenly distributed among the suggested subpopulations. Our approach can be used to assess the location and strength of dispersal barriers in the landscape, and identify conservation units when extensive genotyping is prohibitively costly to cover necessary spatial and temporal scales, e.g. in spatial management of marine populations.

AB Ecological theory suggests that positive plantplant interactions can extend species distributions into areas that would otherwise be unfavourable. However, few studies have tested this hypothesis, and none have explicitly examined the associated prediction that inter-specific interactions between plants may broaden species altitudinal distributions. Here we test this prediction, using fine-scale species distribution data for 156 bryophytes, lichens and vascular plants spanning a 900 m elevational gradient in north-western Finland and Norway, analysed with a niche modelling approach. Species altitudinal ranges of all three groups of plants were more accurately predicted when including the cover of any of the 24 most wide-spread and abundant species (dominants) than when using abiotic variables alone, emphasizing the importance of including relevant biotic predictors in species distribution models. Half of the models showed that species had very low probabilities of occurrence under high cover of dominants, suggesting a strong negative impact of dominant species. Similarly, for species that are predicted to occur irrespective of dominant species cover, 62% of models showed narrower species altitudinal distributions when occurring under high dominant cover, with contractions of species lower and upper elevational limits being common. Nonetheless, high cover of dominant species was associated with upslope range extension in 43 species, and a net range expansion in nearly 10% of all models. Species distributional responses to dominants were only weakly related to species traits, with larger range contractions associated with arctic-alpine dominants. Therefore, dominant species appear to exert a strong influence on the elevational distribution of other species in high latitude environments.

AB Nitrogen (N) fixation in the feather moss-cyanobacteria association represents a major N source in boreal forests which experience low levels of N deposition; however, little is known about the effects of anthropogenic N inputs on the rate of fixation of atmospheric N-2 in mosses and the succeeding effects on soil nutrient concentrations and microbial community composition. We collected soil samples and moss shoots of Pleurozium schreberi at six distances along busy and remote roads in northern Sweden to assess the influence of road-derived N inputs on N-2 fixation in moss, soil nutrient concentrations and microbial communities. Soil nutrients were similar between busy and remote roads; N-2 fixation was higher in mosses along the remote roads than along the busy roads and increased with increasing distance from busy roads up to rates of N-2 fixation similar to remote roads. Throughfall N was higher in sites adjacent to the busy roads but showed no distance effect. Soil microbial phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) composition exhibited a weak pattern regarding road type. Concentrations of bacterial and total PLFAs decreased with increasing distance from busy roads, whereas fungal PLFAs showed no distance effect. Our results show that N-2 fixation in feather mosses is highly affected by N deposition, here derived from roads in northern Sweden. Moreover, as other measured factors showed only weak differences between the road types, atmospheric N-2 fixation in feather mosses represents a highly sensitive indicator for increased N loads to natural systems.

AB The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of elevated CO2 concentration and nitrogen addition on soil organic carbon fractions in subtropical forests where the ambient N deposition was high.
   Seedlings of typical subtropical forest ecosystems were transplanted in ten open-top chambers and grown under CO2 and nitrogen treatments. The treatments included: 1) elevated CO2 (700 mu mol mol(-1)); 2) N addition of 100 kg NH4NO3 ha(-1) yr(-1); 3) combined elevated CO2 and N addition; and 4) control. We measured soil total organic carbon (TOC), particulate organic carbon (POC), readily oxidizable organic carbon (ROC), and microbial biomass carbon (MBC).
   Results showed that elevated CO2 alone did not significantly affect soil TOC, POC and ROC after 4 years of treatment, but increased soil MBC and soil respiration compared to the control. N addition alone had no significant effect neither on soil TOC, POC and ROC, but decreased MBC and soil respiration over time. However, the elevated CO2 and N addition together significantly increased soil POC and ROC, and had no significant effect on soil MBC.
   This study indicated that even in N-rich subtropical forest ecosystems, inputs of N are still needed in order to sustain soil C accumulation under elevated CO2.

AB Tree hollows are a critical, yet potentially limiting habitat resource for many animal species. Fire influences hollow availability, and the associated indirect effects on fauna can threaten the persistence of hollow-dependent species in fire-prone systems. We investigated the influence of two temporal aspects of fire regimes (time-since-fire, inter-fire interval) on hollow occurrence in a semi-arid, fire-prone region in south-eastern Australia. Empirical data on the characteristics of hollow-bearing eucalypt stems and fire-history attributes were compiled for 581 study sites. Mixed models were used to examine the relative influence of time-since-fire and inter-fire interval on hollow occurrence. Time-since-fire and inter-fire interval both affected the probability of hollow occurrence, but in different ways. Time-since-fire influenced the occurrence of hollows in live and dead stems. As time-since-fire increased, so too did the probability of live and dead stems containing hollows. Live stems did not provide hollows before 40 years post-fire, while the probability of dead stems containing hollows peaked at 50-60 years. Inter-fire interval influenced the availability of hollows in dead stems. Longer inter-fire intervals resulted in an increased density of dead hollow-bearing stems. In this region, hollow-dependent fauna will benefit from increased fire-free periods, both in terms of individual fire events and the intervals between repeated fires. These results highlight the complex way in which fire affects the availability of faunal habitat resources, and the extended time periods over which such influences operate. Understanding the effects of fire regimes on slow-developing habitat resources over long time-frames is imperative for sound ecological fire management. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Climate change driven ocean warming and acidification is potentially detrimental to the sensitive planktonic life stages of benthic marine invertebrates. Research has focused on the effects of acidification on calcifying larvae with a paucity of data on species with alternate developmental strategies and on the interactive effects of warming and acidification. To determine the impact of climate change on a conspicuous component of the intertidal fauna of southeast Australia, the development of the noncalcifying lecithotrophic larvae of the sea star Meridiastra calcar was investigated in the setting of predicted ocean warming (+2 to 4 similar to degrees C) and acidification (-0.4 to 0.6 pH units) for 2100 and beyond in all combinations of stressors. Temperature and pH were monitored in the habitat of M.similar to calcar to place experiments in context with current environmental conditions. There was no effect of temperature or pH on cleavage stage embryos but later development (gastrula-larvae) was negatively effected by a +2 to 4 similar to degrees C warming and there was a negative effect of -0.6 pH units on embryos reaching the hatched gastrula stage. Mortality and abnormal development in larvae increased significantly even with +2 similar to degrees C warming and larval growth was impaired at +4 similar to degrees C. For the range of temperature and pH conditions tested, there were no interactive effects of stressors across all stages monitored. For M.similar to calcar, warming not acidification was the dominant stressor. A regression model incorporating data from this study and projected increasing SST for the region suggests an increase in larval mortality to 70% for M.similar to calcar by 2100 in the absence of acclimation and adaptation. The broad distribution of this species in eastern Australia encompassing subtropical to cold temperate thermal regimes provides the possibility that local M.similar to calcar populations may be sustained in a warming world through poleward migration of thermotolerant propagules, facilitated by the strong southward flow of the East Australian Current.

AB 1. There is a pressing need to understand how to facilitate species range shifts under climate change. However, few empirical studies are available to inform decision-making, particularly at fine spatial and temporal resolutions. 2. We present a case study of a thermally constrained habitat specialist, the silver-spotted skipper butterfly Hesperia comma, at its expanding range margin in south-eastern Britain. Using data from 724 habitat patches over a 9-year interval (20002009), we examined local and landscape determinants of colonization, survival and population density. We then predicted probabilities of colonization and survival for habitat patches under the observed 1982 and 2009 distributions to investigate how the factors limiting range expansions change through space and time. 3. Between 2000 and 2009, Hesperia comma continued to expand its range in Britain, but the 67 recorded colonization events were offset by 48 local extinctions. Extinctions were strongly linked to climate, occurring predominantly in cooler regions and on shaded north-facing slopes. 4. Population density and probability of survival were closely related to conditions within a site, whereas probability of colonization was largely determined by functional connectivity. Survival probability was also influenced by connectivity, suggesting that immigration helped to support extinction-prone populations (a rescue effect). 5. Patch occupancy beyond the range margin was primarily constrained by colonization, but close to the expanding front, population survival became the key limiting factor. This pattern was conserved during range expansion, altering management priorities at individual sites. 6. Synthesis and applications. Previous studies on facilitating range shifts have stressed the need to increase landscape-scale connectivity to remove constraints on colonization, and our data substantiate this advice. However, we show that enhancing population survival can also help to facilitate range expansions, because populations at leading range edges face high extinction risk. Population survival can be improved directly through local management actions, such as enlarging patch size and increasing habitat quality, or indirectly by improving connectivity. Thus, local management can secure vulnerable populations at the range edge and provide larger and more stable migrant sources for future expansion and deserves consideration when facilitating range shifts under climate change.

AB Business activities play a major role in biodiversity loss so that firms are under increasing pressures from stakeholders to mitigate their negative impacts on ecosystems. As business attitudes, policies and behaviors regarding biodiversity and ecosystem services (BES) progressively change, a better understanding of how business strategies may be framed and implemented is required. In the first part of this paper, we discuss how biodiversity is usually understood as an external environmental constraint on business activities, and how this perception influences arbitrages. We then discuss how assessing BES interdependencies (impacts and dependencies) may bring about new business strategies and needs: we explore the opportunities and challenges of emerging mechanisms of payments for ecosystem services and expose the need for standardized sets of indicators at different scales for the effective management of their BES dependencies and impacts.

AB Revisiting the past 60 yrs of studies of the ecology of fishes on coral reefs reveals successive decadal trends that highlight many lasting contributions relevant to fisheries biology, conservation biology, and ecology in general. The Bulletin of Marine Science was founded in 1951, about the same time SCUBA was first used to study reef fishes, so the 1950s was a decade of initial subtidal exploration by early pioneers. Detailed natural-history investigations of the use of space, food, and time by reef fishes developed in the 1960s, including studies based from undersea habitats late that decade. The 1970s saw the first comprehensive observational studies of reef-fish communities, as well as initial breakthroughs in behavioral ecology, especially regarding cleaning symbiosis, mating systems, and sex reversal. In community ecology, the conventional wisdom that interspecific competition structured reef-fish assemblages via equilibrium dynamics and resource partitioning was called into question by the "lottery hypothesis," which posited that coexistence of ecologically similar species was fostered by nonequilibrial dynamics. The 1980s, in turn, were dominated by debate regarding the relative importance of larval supply vs post-settlement interactions in determining the local abundance and diversity of reef fishes. The "recruitment limitation hypothesis" asserted that larval settlement was so low that subsequent population dynamics were not only unpredictable, but also density-independent. Population and community studies during the 1990s thus focused largely on detecting demographic density dependence in reef-fish populations and identifying the mechanisms underlying this ultimate source of population regulation. From the 1980s to the present, studies of behavioral ecology and interactions between fishes and other reef organisms continued to flourish. Late in the 20th century, it became clear that coral reefs and their fish inhabitants were increasingly threatened, and conservation biology of reef fishes developed as a substantial new subdiscipline. The 2000s comprised the "connectivity" decade as new means of tracking patterns of larval dispersal developed. Knowledge of how larval dispersal connects local populations and/or results in self-recruitment that replenishes a local population is essential for understanding metapopulation dynamics and implementing effective fisheries management and conservation efforts. There is currently a major shift toward conservation biology among many reef-fish ecologists, including studies of the effects of and solutions for overfishing, habitat degradation, invasive species, ocean warming and acidification, and other human-caused environmental challenges. Marine reserves and protected areas are now well documented to be particularly effective at fostering both ecological resilience in general and fisheries sustainability on coral reefs. Future research must necessarily be conservation-based if there are to be any reasonably undisturbed reeffish communities for coming generations of ecologists to study. I personally believe that those of us who have observed the demise of coral reefs first-hand have two major responsibilities: first, conduct basic or applied research indirectly or directly relevant to conservation of reef fishes, and second, speak out as both citizens and scientists to bear witness to these losses, which are largely unseen by the public, and assist managers and policymakers in saving our remaining reefs.

AB Cost surface (CS) models have emerged as a useful tool to examine the interactions between landscapes patterns and wildlife at large-scale extents. This approach is particularly relevant to guide conservation planning for species that show vulnerability to road networks in human-dominated landscapes. In this study, we measured the functional connectivity of the landscape in southern Portugal and examined how it may be related to stone marten road mortality risk. We addressed three questions: (1) How different levels of landscape connectivity influence stone marten occurrence in montado patches? (2) Is there any relation between montado patches connectivity and stone marten road mortality risk? (3) If so, which road-related features might be responsible for the species' high road mortality? We developed a series of connectivity models using CS scenarios with different resistance values given to each vegetation cover type to reflect different resistance to species movement. Our models showed that the likelihood of occurrence of stone marten decreased with distance to source areas, meaning continuous montado. Open areas and riparian areas within open area matrices entailed increased costs. We found higher stone marten mortality on roads in well-connected areas. Road sinuosity was an important factor influencing the mortality in those areas. This result challenges the way that connectivity and its relation to mortality has been generally regarded. Clearly, landscape connectivity and road-related mortality are not independent.

AB Question: What are the main drivers for tree species distribution in the Bavarian Alps? What are the species-specific habitat requirements? Are predictions in accordance with expert knowledge?
   Location: Bavarian Alps (Southern Germany).
   Methods: To describe tree species-environment relationships, we established species distribution models for the 14 most common tree species of the region. We combined tree species occurrence data from forest inventories and a vegetation database with environmental data from a digital elevation model, climate maps and soil maps. For modelling, we used generalized additive models (GAM) combined with techniques to account for spatial autocorrelation and uneven coverage of environmental gradients. We developed parsimonious models to judge whether statistical models correspond to models based on expert knowledge.
   Results: Conceptual models were generally in accordance with expectations. Variables based on average temperatures were the most important predictors in most models. Proxies for soil properties such as water and nutrient availability were statistically significant and generally plausible, but appeared largely redundant for model performance. Altitudinal limits of tree species were generally well represented by models. Most species responded differently to summer and January temperatures, indicating that temperature variables are proxies not only for energy balance, but also for frost damage and drought. Although model building benefits considerably from collation with expert knowledge, there are limitations.
   Conclusions: Meaningful species distribution models can be obtained from noisy data sets covering only a small fraction of species ranges. Models calibrated with such data sets benefit from hypothesis-driven model building rather than strict data-driven model building. Hence, misleading explanations and predictions can be avoided and uncertainties identified. Nevertheless, projections based on climate scenarios can be substantially improved only with models calibrated on a wider data set. Ideally, environmental gradients should cover the whole niche space of a species, or at least include regions with analogous climate.

AB Mitochondrial DNA (cox1) sequence data and recently developed coalescent phylogeography models were used to construct geo-spatial histories for the New Zealand fungus beetles Epistranus lawsoni and Pristoderus bakewelli (Zopheridae). These methods utilize continuous-time Markov chains and Bayesian stochastic search variable selection incorporated in BEAST to identify historical dispersal patterns via ancestral state reconstruction. Ecological niche models (ENMs) were incorporated to reconstruct the potential geographic distribution of each species during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Coalescent analyses suggest a North Island origin for E. lawsoni, with gene flow predominately north-south between adjacent regions. ENMs for E. lawsoni indicated glacial refugia in coastal regions of both main islands, consistent with phylogenetic patterns but at odds with the coalescent dates, which implicate much older topographic events. Dispersal matrices revealed patterns of gene flow consistent with projected refugia, suggesting long-term South Island survival with population vicariance around the Southern Alps. Phylogeographic relationships are more ambiguous for P. bakewelli, although long-term survival on both main islands is evident. Divergence dates for both species are consistent with the topographic evolution of New Zealand over the last 10 Ma, whereas the signature of the LGM is less apparent in the time-scaled phylogeny.

AB The theoretical foundations of population and community ecology stress the importance of identifying crucial niche requirements and life history stages of invasive species and, in doing so, give insight into research and management. We focus on Microstegium vimineum, an invasive grass which is causing marked changes in the structure and function of US forests. We describe M. vimineum's life history and habitat characteristics, infer its niche requirements and synthesize this information in the context of population dynamics and management. Based on the results synthesized here, M. vimineum's crucial niche requirements appear to be light (reproductive output), soil moisture (reproductive output, seedling recruitment) and aboveground coverage by leaf-litter and competing species (seedling recruitment and survival). These data suggest a source-sink dynamic might allow M. vimineum to disperse and thrive along sunny, and sometimes wet, edge habitats and, in turn, these populations might act as source populations for adjacent shady forest habitats. By evaluating M. vimineum in the context of its stage-specific requirements, we highlight potential weaknesses in its life history that provide strategies for effective management.

AB We present a novel method for calculating the opportunity costs to fishers from their displacement by the establishment of marine protected areas (MPAs). We used a fishing community in Kubulau District, Fiji to demonstrate this method. We modelled opportunity costs as a function of food fish abundance and probability of catch, based on gear type and market value of species. Count models (including Poisson, negative binomial and two zero-inflated models) were used to predict spatial abundance of preferred target fish species and were validated against field surveys. A profit model was used to investigate the effect of restricted access to transport on costs to fishers. Spatial distributions of fish within the three most frequently sighted food fish families (Acanthuridae, Lutjanidae, Scaridae) varied, with greatest densities of Lutjanidae and Acanthuridae on barrier forereefs and greatest densities of Scaridae on submerged reefs. Modelled opportunity cost indicated that highest costs to fishers arise from restricting access to the barrier forereefs. We included our opportunity cost model in Marxan, a decision support tool used for MPA design, to examine potential MPA configurations for Kubulau District, Fiji Islands. We identified optimum areas for protection in Kubulau with: (a) the current MPA network locked in place; and (b) a clean-slate approach. Our method of modelling opportunity cost gives an unbiased estimate for multiple gear types in a marine environment and can be applied to other regions using existing species data.

AB Large-scale natural disturbances are commonplace around the world. They can have profound effects on human infrastructure and populations, as well as substantially influencing key ecological processes, shaping landscapes, and affecting many species. Major natural disturbances also have the potential to produce important ecological and resource management insights. Here, we argue that it is essential to initiate research quickly after such disturbances, and provide examples illustrating the ecological and management discoveries that arise from the early initiation of post-disturbance studies. However, there are currently few funding programs available to support this type of rapid research response. Consequently, many ecological and management learning opportunities are lost. We propose ways to address these problems, including: (1) establishing funding programs specifically directed at supporting studies of ecosystem response and recovery after major disturbances, and (2) encouraging scientists to develop plans for studying natural disturbances before they occur.

AB Despite a growing interest in incorporating fisher knowledge into quantitative conservation assessments, there remain practical impediments to its use. In particular, there is some debate about the accuracy of fisher knowledge. In this study, we report an attempt to quantify assumptions about how accurately fishers report past events (retrospective bias). Then we examine how the assumption we make about retrospective bias affects the characterization of changes in the fishery and extinction risk. We link fisher interviews and fisher logbooks to establish a catch rate (catch per unit of effort) trend for the history of a data-poor, small-scale seahorse fishery in the Philippines. We find that fishers perceive historic declines in fishing rate that are not apparent in more recent logbook trends, and the extent of the decline (and therefore extinction risk) hinges on assumptions we make about the accuracy of fisher recall. Scenarios that ignore retrospective bias result in the most severe declines and the most worrying extinction risk classifications. Furthermore, the historic baseline set by interviews suggests that relying on recent decades of data alone may underestimate extinction risk for our study species, and others that have been historically exploited. Attempting to link interviews with logbooks also illustrates differences between fisher-derived datasets: retrospective interviews may exaggerate early fishing rates and capture less variability than logbooks. In addition to being the first seahorse fishery reconstruction, our work contributes to the emerging interest in how fisher knowledge can guide conservation assessment. Future studies that incorporate fisher knowledge into quantitative assessments require (1) clearly stated assumptions about fisher knowledge bias; (2) clear criteria to compare fisher knowledge collected with different methods; (3) evaluation of the impact of assumptions on assessments.

AB Plants use a diverse mix of defenses against herbivores, including multiple secondary metabolites, which often affect herbivores synergistically. Chemical defenses also can affect natural enemies of herbivores via limiting herbivore populations or by affecting herbivore resistance to parasitoids. In this study, we performed feeding experiments to examine the synergistic effects of imides and amides (hereafter "amides") from Piper cenocladum and P. imperiale on specialist (Eois nympha, Geometridae) and generalist (Spodoptera frugiperda, Noctuidae) lepidopteran larvae. Each Piper species has three unique amides, and in each experiment, larvae were fed diets containing different concentrations of single amides or combinations of the three. The amides from P. imperiale had negative synergistic effects on generalist survival and specialist pupal mass, but had no effect on specialist survival. Piper cenocladum amides also acted synergistically to increase mortality caused by parasitoids, and the direct negative effects of mixtures on parasitoid resistance and pupal mass were stronger than indirect effects via changes in growth rate and approximate digestibility. Our results are consistent with plant defense theory that predicts different effects of plant chemistry on generalist versus adapted specialist herbivores. The toxicity of Piper amide mixtures to generalist herbivores are standard bottom-up effects, while specialists experienced the top-down mediated effect of mixtures causing reduced parasitoid resistance and associated decreases in pupal mass.

AB The existence of microrefugia and/or cryptic refugia has been proposed to explain the colonization patterns of temperate continents after the Last Glacial Maximum, as well as to gain an understanding of the present genetic structure of species and their populations. The concepts 'microrefugia' and 'cryptic refugia' largely overlap but do not fully coincide, which may lead to terminological duplication and eventual semantic misconceptions. Here, after a terminological and conceptual analysis, it is proposed that most situations currently characterized as cryptic refugia can be accommodated within the definition of microrefugia, with one single exception, for which some alternative terms are suggested. Moreover, the concept and definition of cryptic refugia are considered to be more imprecise, perishable and subjective than those of microrefugia, which is the preferred term in the current context.

AB The Earth's resources are finite, therefore planning for their use requires the definition of broad goals and the formulation of operational targets derived from goals, that enable decisions to be made and success measured. The objective of this study was to review methods for the formulation of percentage conservation targets for the coverage of habitat types within a network of conservation areas. We reviewed the scope and data requirements of these methods and discussed the strengths and limitations of their application. We identified five groups of methods applicable to habitat types that define: (1) fixed percentage targets across all habitats based on species-area relationship, or habitat-specific targets based on (2) species-area relationship, (3) heuristic principles, (4) trade-off of target size with reserved area, or (5) spatially-explicit Population Viability Analysis (PVA) for selected species. No ideal method exists and two factors should guide the choice of a method: the type of biodiversity goal and data availability. Given the lack of perfect biodiversity data, we suggest the use of a composite target based on a combination of methods. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Mitigating the effects of habitat loss requires estimating the minimum amount of habitat necessary for the persistence of wildlife populations in a changing landscape Assessing minimum habitat amounts. however, relies on identifying ecological thresholds in species' responses to landscape change. Using two repeated state-wide atlases, our objective was to investigate the responses of 25 forest birds to a range of forest cover and fragmentation. Repeat atlases allow for the analysis of four population dynamics including: (1) colonization, (2) persistence, (3) extinction, and (4) absence Our objective was to test the hypothesis that forest birds demonstrated thresholds in these four basic dynamics to varying amounts of forest cover and fragmentation
   We found thresholds to be a common, though not pervasive, characteristic of how forest birds respond to forest cover and pattern We found that the probability of persistence was positively correlated with forest cover and 22 species demonstrated threshold responses. In addition, 15 of 25 birds demonstrated discrete thresholds in extinction dynamics The existence of a colonization threshold has received significantly less attention in ecology. We also found that 17 out of 25 species demonstrated thresholds in their colonization response to a greater amount of forest cover. The effects of forest fragmentation, independent of forest amount, were less clear. We found support for incorporating the effects of fragmentation, but this fragmentation effect was found both below and above threshold points We conclude that incorporating ecological thresholds in environmental planning should be species-specific and focus on populations on the verge of rapid ecological change.

AB Soil nutrient environments are changing in forests of the northeastern United States due to decades of anthropogenic nitrogen (N) emissions and acidic deposition, causing N enrichment and cation depletion, and possibly alleviating N limitation to forest growth. We asked whether biotic demand for phosphorus (P) or calcium (Ca) exceeded that for N and used an ingrowth core approach to test belowground responses to different nutrients. We tested fine root foraging for nutrients (N, P, or Ca) in three mid-age (26-30 years) and mature (a parts per thousand yen100 years) northern hardwood forest stands in the Bartlett Experimental Forest (BEF), NH, and in one mature forest stand in the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest (HBEF), NH, USA. Fine root colonization of cores responded clearly to Ca in mature forest at HBEF, responded to P in mid-age forests at BEF, and responded primarily to N in mature forests at BEF. Net N mineralization potential was higher in soils of mid-age than mature forests at BEF, with roots responding to N where N availability was low and to P or Ca where N availability was high. Nutrients elicited no responses from either fungi or phosphatase activity in mid-age forests, but in mature forests at BEF, N enhanced phosphatase activity. While no straightforward pattern emerged among the different mechanisms of nutrient acquisition that we tested, our results do suggest that P and Ca can be important limiting nutrients in these northern hardwood forests when N availability is relatively high. We hypothesize that the interacting effects of disturbance by forest harvest and N deposition can cause a transient P limitation to forest growth, and that other nutrients become more limiting as forests age.

AB Human-centered land use causes ecosystem degradation and loss of biodiversity in streams, yet such processes may be highly heterogeneous among species and regions. We quantified fish species sensitivity to several classes of land use and determined if trends varied among three geoclimatic regions of Maryland, USA. Our approach compares the cumulative frequency distribution (CFD) of sites where a species was expected to occur to the CFD of those where it was collected to estimate the species-specific maximum degree of land use tolerated and the minimal amount that may induce an impact. Fishes were most vulnerable to urban land use gradients, though trends were region-specific with heightened sensitivity in the Piedmont (64-72% of species negatively affected) relative to the Coastal Plain (45-52% negatively affected). Species found in both regions exhibited greater vulnerability to urbanization in the Piedmont. Responses to agricultural land use were less severe though trends were region-specific as well with the least sensitive in the Piedmont and the greatest negative impact in the Highlands region. In many cases, reduced population abundances were detected at lower levels of land use relative to the range where the species was apparently extirpated. Our results demonstrate that population reduction and species loss due to land use change differs substantially among regions, even within a single species. Greater sensitivity observed in abundance-weighted analyses implies that further loss of fish diversity may be impending in impacted streams. Our results have direct application to prioritize conservation resources and forecast future declines in species distributions and biodiversity. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Large populations of the sea urchin Diadema aff. antillarum occur in the east Atlantic archipelagos. The origin and stability of these large herbivorous populations are not well known. Variability in settlement, recruitment and adult urchin density were quantified and compared over a 7 yr period (2002 to 2008) within the Canary Islands. Variables that potentially affect urchin settlement such as gonad index, temperature and primary productivity (phytoplankton) were measured. Settlement was found to be high during warm years; temperatures >24 degrees C induced important settlement pulses. Postsettlement survival in barren areas of Tenerife was exponentially and positively correlated with seawater temperature changes, while very low to 0 survival was found at macroalgal beds off El Hierro. Assuming that climate change predictions are correct, the strong positive relationship between thermal history and postsettlement survival of this ecologically important species suggests that barren grounds will persist as seawater warms up if no mass mortality occurs. This future scenario will have important implications for the stability of algal beds and coastal ecosystems as a whole.

AB Management and conservation of ecosystems relies on biodiversity data; however, broad-scale biological data are often limited. Predictive modelling using environmental variables has recently proven a valuable tool in addressing this gap. Wave exposure is a particularly important environmental variable that structures shallow reef systems, but it is rarely quantified across the large areas often used for predictive studies. Therefore, we investigated approaches that quantify exposure and can be readily applied across a large area. We generated 6 quantitative indices that emphasise different aspects of exposure using a numerical wave model and cartographic fetch models. The utility of these indices for predictive modelling in shallow temperate reef systems was assessed by how well they explained community and genera-level algal patterns in Tasmania, Australia, which is a region that experiences a wide range of wave exposure conditions. Exposure indices were significant predictors of algal patterns, explaining up to 18% of community level patterns and up to 37% of the variance associated with the occurrence and cover of algal genera. Fetch-based indices in particular appear to be a viable option for quantifying exposure on shallow reefs. These indices can be generated within a Geographic Information System (GIS) program for specific sites of interest, along coastlines or on a grid, and are potentially accessible to ecologists. Quantification of exposure across broad regions using fetch indices will allow ecologists to makes advances in predictive modelling studies, but also facilitate studies that test the generality of hypotheses and mechanisms driving patterns previously observed using qualitative measures.

AB Sexual reproduction implies high costs, but it is difficult to give evidence for evolutionary advantages that would explain the predominance of meiotic sex in eukaryotes. A combinational theory discussing evolution, maintenance and loss of sex may resolve the problem. The main function of sex is the restoration of DNA and consequently a higher quality of offspring. Recombination at meiosis evolved, perhaps, as a repair mechanism of DNA strand damages. This mechanism is most efficient for DNA restoration in multicellular eukaryotes, because the initial cell starts with a re-optimized genome, which is passed to all the daughter cells. Meiosis acts also as creator of variation in haploid stages, in which selection can purge most efficiently deleterious mutations. A prolonged diploid phase buffers the effects of deleterious recessive alleles as well as epigenetic defects and is thus optimal for prolonged growth periods. For complex multicellular organisms, the main advantage of sexuality is thus the alternation of diploid and haploid stages, combining advantages of both. A loss of sex is constrained by several, partly group-specific, developmental features. Hybridization may trigger shifts from sexual to asexual reproduction, but crossing barriers of the parental sexual species limit this process. For the concerted break-up of meiosis-outcrossing cycles plus silencing of secondary features, various group-specific changes in the regulatory system may be required. An establishment of asexuals requires special functional modifications and environmental opportunities. Costs for maintenance of meiotic sex are consequently lower than a shift to asexual reproduction. Heredity (2009) 103, 445-457; doi:10.1038/hdy.2009.85; published online 22 July 2009

AB Species range boundaries are determined by a variety of factors of which climate is one of the most influential. As a result, climate change is expected to have a profound effect on organisms and ecosystems. However, the impacts of weather and climate are frequently modified by multiple nonclimatic factors. Therefore, the role of these nonclimatic factors needs to be examined in order to understand and predict future change. Marine intertidal ecosystems are exposed to heat extremes during warm, sunny, midday low tides. Thus, the timing of low tide, a nonclimatic factor, determines the potential contact intertidal invertebrates and algae have with heat extremes. We developed a method that quantifies the daily risk of high temperature extremes in the marine intertidal using solar elevations and spatially continuous tidal predictions. The frequency of 'risky days' is variable over time and space along the Pacific Coast of North America. Results show that at some sites the percentage of risky days in June can vary by 30% across years. In order to do a detailed analysis, we selected San Francisco as a study site. In San Francisco, May is the month with the greatest frequency of risky days, even though September is the month with the greatest frequency of high air temperature, >= 30 degrees C. These results indicate that marine intertidal organisms can be protected from high temperature extremes due to the timing of tides and local weather patterns. In addition, annual fluctuations in tides influence the frequency of intertidal zone exposures to high temperature extremes. Peaks in risk for heat extremes in the intertidal zone occur every 18 years, the length of the tidal epoch. These results suggest that nonclimatic variables can complicate predictions of shifts in species ranges due to climate change, but that mechanistic approaches can be used to produce predictions that include these factors.

AB Remote populations are predicted to be vulnerable owing to their isolation from potential source reefs, and usually low population size and associated increased extinction risk. We investigated genetic diversity, population subdivision and connectivity in the brooding reef coral Seriatopora hystrix at the limits of its Eastern Australian (EA) distribution and three sites in the southern Great Barrier Reef (GBR). Over the approximately 1270 km survey range, high levels of population subdivision were detected (global F-ST = 0.224), with the greatest range in pairwise F-ST values observed among the three southernmost locations: Lord Howe Island, Elizabeth Reef and Middleton Reef. Flinders Reef, located between the GBR and the more southerly offshore reefs, was highly isolated and showed the signature of a recent bottleneck. High pairwise FST values and the presence of multiple genetic clusters indicate that EA subtropical coral populations have been historically isolated from each other and the GBR. One putative first-generation migrant was detected from the GBR into the EA subtropics. Occasional long-distance dispersal is supported by changes in species composition at these high-latitude reefs and the occurrence of new species records over the past three decades. While subtropical populations exhibited significantly lower allelic richness than their GBR counterparts, genetic diversity was still moderately high. Furthermore, subtropical populations were not inbred and had a considerable number of private alleles. The results suggest that these high-latitude S. hystrix populations are supplemented by infrequent long-distance migrants from the GBR and may have adequate population sizes to maintain viability and resist severe losses of genetic diversity.

AB Plant biosecurity activities in the United States fall along a continuum ranging from offshore activities to the management of newly established exotic pests. For each step in the continuum, we examine the roles, responsibilities, and information needs of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service and other agencies involved in plant biosecurity. Both costs and information needs increase dramatically as a pest penetrates deeper into the continumn. To help meet these information needs, we propose a cyberinfrastructure for plant biosecurity to link phytosanitary agencies, researchers, and stakeholders, including industry and the public. The cyberinfrastructurc should facilitate data collection, data integration, risk analysis, and reporting. We also emphasize the role of private industry in providing critical data for surveillance. We anticipate that this article will provide agricultural stakeholders, including scientists, with a better understanding of the information needs of phylosanitary organizations, and will ultimately lead to a more coordinated biosecurity effort.

AB We conducted a field manipulation experiment to investigate developmental and demographic responses to warming and increased precipitation in three Inner Mongolian grasshopper species that differ in phenology (an early-season species Dasyhippus barbipes, a mid-season species Oedaleus asiaticus, and a late-season species Chorthippus fallax). Infrared heaters were used for warming the ground surface by 1-2 degrees C above the ambient condition and periodic irrigations were applied to simulate a 50% increase in annual precipitation. We found that warming advanced the timing for egg hatching and grasshopper eclosion in each of the three species. However, grasshopper diapause and increased precipitation appeared to offset the effect of warming on egg development. Hatching and development were more strongly affected by warming in the mid-season O. asiaticus and the late-season C. fallax relative to the early-season D. barbipes. Warming by similar to 1.5 degrees C advanced the occurrence of the mid-season O. asiaticus by an average of 4.96 days; while warming and increased precipitation interactively affected the occurrence of the late-season C. fallax, which advanced by 5.53 days. Our data and those of others suggest that most grasshopper species in the Inner Mongolian grassland are likely to extend their distribution northward with climate change. However, because of the differential response to warming we demonstrate for these species, the different grasshopper species are predicted to aggregate toward the middle period of the growing season, potentially increasing interspecific competition and grazing pressure on grasslands.

AB Fuel treatments for reducing fire risk are necessarily tied to the landscape structure including forest composition and configuration. Thus understanding the relationships between landscape structure and burn severity is important for developing guidelines and management strategies for fire-resilient forests. The goal of this study was to investigate the relationship between landscape structure as described by spatial pattern metrics and burn severity at the landscape and class levels. In 2000, a mostly severe fire burned 16,210 ha of dense forest located in Samchuck on the east coast of the Korean peninsula. Spatial pattern metrics including patch density, largest patch index, mean shape index, area-weighted mean shape index, Euclidean nearest neighborhood distance, and Shannon's diversity index, as well as topographic characteristics of slope and elevation, were correlated with burn severity based on delta Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR) assessments. Regression tree analysis was also carried out with the same variables to avoid spatial autocorrelation and to reveal the relative importance of variables to burn severity. The results of this study strongly suggest that both composition and configuration of the forest cover patches are closely tied to burn severity. In particular, both the correlation analysis and regression tree analysis indicated that the area of red pine tree forest cover was the most significant factor in explaining the variance of burn severity. Topography and spatial configuration of forest cover patches were also significantly related to burn severity. The heterogeneity of forests also had a significant influence on burn severity. To reduce fire risk and increase the fire resilience of forests, forest managers and agencies need to consider enhancing the heterogeneity of forests when implementing fuel treatment schemes. However, such fuel treatments for landscape structure may only be effective under moderate weather conditions. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Wildlife crossing-structures (e. g., underpasses and overpasses) are used to mitigate deleterious effects of highways on wildlife populations. Evaluating performance of mitigation measures depends on monitoring structures for wildlife use. We analyzed efficacy of 2 noninvasive methods commonly used to monitor crossing-structure use by large mammals: tracking and motion-activated cameras. We monitored 15 crossing-structures every other day between 29 June and 24 October 2007 along the Trans-Canada Highway in Alberta, Canada. Our objectives were to determine how species-specific detection rates are biased by the detection method used, to determine factors contributing to crossing-event detection, and to evaluate the most cost-effective approach to monitoring. We detected 3,405 crossing events by tracks and 4,430 crossings events by camera for mammals coyote-sized and larger. Coyotes (Canis latrans) and grizzly bears (Ursus arctos) were significantly more likely to be detected by track-pads, whereas elk (Cervus elaphus) and deer (Odocoileus sp.) were more likely to be detected by cameras. Crossing-event detection was affected by species, track-pad length, and number of animals using the crossing structure. At the levels of animal activity observed in our study our economic analysis indicates that cameras are more cost-effective than track-pads for study durations >1 year. Understanding the benefits and limitations of camera and track-pad methods for monitoring large mammal movement at wildlife crossing-structures will help improve the efficiency of studies designed to evaluate the effectiveness of highway mitigation measures.

AB P>1. Crayfish are among the most threatened taxa in the world and invasive crayfish are the primary cause of the decline of native crayfish. Most research has emphasised biotic interactions as the mechanism by which native crayfish are displaced by invasives, although crayfish occupy variable environments and the role of disturbance in facilitating crayfish invasion and displacement is understudied.
   2. We compared tolerance to a disturbance, stream drying, in a native and invasive crayfish as a potential mechanism to explain their distribution. Our experiments and observations were conducted across scales, from laboratory environmental chambers to stream mesocosms to field sampling. We hypothesised that the invasive crayfish would be more tolerant of desiccation than the native, and that this physiological distinction between the two would be reflected in their distribution in relation to stream drying.
   3. In the laboratory, the native crayfish Orconectes eupunctus was less tolerant of desiccation than the invasive Orconectes neglectus chaenodactylus, with all native crayfish dying within 2 days without water, while some of the invasive crayfish survived for nearly 2 weeks. Under simulated stream drying in mesocosms, only the native O. eupunctus survived less well than in a control. Field sampling demonstrated a significant negative relationship between O. eupunctus density and low summer flows, while O. neglectus density was positively associated with low summer flows. The greater resistance of O. neglectus to drying could, through priority effects, inhibit recolonisation by O. eupunctus once flow resumes.
   4. Abiotic disturbances are potentially important to the displacement of native by invasive crayfish. Disturbance mediated displacement of aquatic species provides both an opportunity to conserve native species by maintaining or restoring habitat and disturbance regimes and is also a challenge due to increasing human water demand, flow regime alteration and global climate change.

AB Wildlife-vehicle collisions (WVCs) pose a significant safety and conservation concern in areas where high-traffic roads are situated adjacent to wildlife habitat. Improving transportation safety, accurately planning highway mitigation, and identifying key habitat linkage areas may all depend on the quality of WVC data collection. Two common approaches to describe the location of WVCs are spatially accurate data derived from global positioning systems (GPS) or vehicle odometer measurements and less accurate road-marker data derived from reference points (e.g., mile-markers or landmarks) along the roadside. In addition, there are two common variable types used to predict WVC locations: (1) field-derived, site-specific measurements and (2) geographic information system (GIS)-derived information. It is unclear whether these different approaches produce similar results when attempting to identify and explain the location of WVCs. Our first objective was to determine and compare the spatial error found in road-marker data (in our case the closest mile-marker) and landmark-referenced data. Our second objective was to evaluate the performance of models explaining high- and low-probability WVC locations, using congruent, spatially accurate (< 3-m) and road-marker (< 800-m) response variables in combination with field- and GIS-derived explanatory variables. Our WVC data sets were comprised of ungulate collisions and were located along five major roads in the central Canadian Rocky Mountains. We found that spatial error (mean +/- A SD) was higher for WVC data referenced to nearby landmarks (516 +/- A 808 m) than for data referenced to the closest mile-marker data (401 +/- A 219 m). The top-performing model using the spatially accurate WVC locations contained all explanatory variable types, whereas GIS-derived variables were only influential in the best road-marker model and the spatially accurate reduced model. Our study showed that spatial error and sample size, using road-marker data for ungulate species, are important to consider for model output interpretation, which will impact the appropriate scale on which to apply modeling results. Using road-marker references < 1.6 km or GPS-derived data locations may represent an optimal compromise between data acquisition costs and analytical performance.

AB Large vagile mammals typically exhibit little genetic structuring across their range, particularly when their habitat is essentially continuous. We investigated the population genetic structure of a large vagile Australian macropodid, Macropus fuliginosus, which is continuously distributed across most of southern Australia, using nine highly polymorphic nuclear microsatellite loci. Five distinct genetic units were identified across the range, four on the mainland and one on Kangaroo Island. In addition to the predicted historic Nullarbor Plain Barrier, two unexpected mainland barriers to gene flow were identified. Both were associated with landscape discontinuities (Swan River, Flinders Ranges), which appear within the dispersal capabilities of M. fuliginosus. Typical of large vagile mammals, M. fuliginosus displays high genetic diversity (with the exception of an insular population) and weak genetic structuring (within genetic units). However, the expansion of M. fuliginosus from southwestern Australia during the Pleistocene has resulted in significantly reduced genetic diversity in eastern populations. No significant sex-biased dispersal was detected, although differences in habitat, densities and climatic conditions between the eastern and western regions of the range appear to influence dispersal with the effects of isolation by distance only evident in the west. These results suggest that the biogeography of southern Australia is more complex than previously thought and reveal that seemingly minor landscape features can significantly impact genetic structuring in large vagile mammals.

AB This work aims to estimate the potential effects of the global warming projected for the twenty-first century on the biodiversity of a remote and pristine region of the Neotropics called Pantepui. Habitat loss and fragmentation by upward migration of bioclimatic conditions is analyzed using Species-Area Relationships (SAR) and Altitudinal Range Displacement (ARD) analysis. The ARD is a tool that uses the present-day lapse rate to estimate the upward migration of the species based on the global warming predicted by the IPCC. The results show that around 80% of the vascular flora, ca. 1,700 species of which up to 400 would be Pantepui endemics, are threatened of extinction. These estimates should be considered preliminary, but the danger is real. Therefore, suitable conservation or mitigation strategies are needed.

AB Goliath grouper (Epinephelus itajara) aggregations and relative abundances were described and mapped through the use of fishermen's local ecological knowledge in Babitonga Bay in southern Brazil. Six well-experienced informants were asked to individually provide information about goliath grouper abundance and distribution, drawn over a satellite image of the study area, which was later overlaid and gathered into a final map. According to our informants, the goliath grouper occurs along a broad salinity and depth range, from shallow estuarine areas (less than 5 m deep) with high freshwater input (smaller individuals, up to 150 kg) to coastal marine-dominated environments (at least 35 m deep); (larger individuals more common, frequently reaching more than 300 kg). Fishermen referred to goliath groupers inhabiting hard substrates such as rocky reefs around islands and continental shores, submerged rocky outcrops and shipwrecks (juveniles and adults). At least two aggregation sites mapped (ranging from 2 to 60 individuals) could be concluded as spawning aggregation sites through evidence of high abundance and spawning activity. Priority research and conservation targets were identified and discussed for Babitonga Bay (e.g., design of a tagging experimental program and establishment of a marine protected area). Fishers' resource mapping provided a means of exchanging information among various disciplines while maintaining methodological rigor in a clear and straightforward way of presenting fishers' knowledge. The use of fishers' sketch maps is a promising tool for marine conservation in Brazil, with special regard to adaptive co-management regimes, where frequent environmental re-evaluations are needed.

AB This paper describes an intensive study of an apparently "simple" stream community-a model system-placed in the context of an extensive study of a suite of progressively more diverse systems-a comparative approach. The main field sites were in the Ashdown Forest of southern England, where a combination of natural and anthropogenic factors produced a gradient of stream acidity along which the stream communities lay. Further streams, primarily in Wales and Scotland, were included as comparative sites when a wider range of environmental conditions was necessary than was available in the Ashdown Forest.
   The acidic and fishless Broadstone Stream community had a small core of macroinvertebrate species, dominated by large-bodied predatory invertebrates, whereas the less acidic comparative sites were more diverse and had fish. Smaller metazoans-the meiofauna-added considerably to overall diversity but the overall gradient from relatively simple (acidic) to complex (circumneutral) systems remained.

AB Many coral reef organisms live in symbiotic relationships with photosynthetic microalgae. This symbiosis extends the energy resources available to reef organisms, thereby potentially influencing biodiversity. In octocorals, about one-half of the taxa contain photosynthetic symbionts while the rest do not, and thus octocorals are an ideal model to assess the relationships between biodiversity, spatial and environmental factors, and photosynthetic symbionts. Data collected from 1106 sites on the Great Barrier Reef, Australia, between 12 degrees and 24 degrees S showed that taxa with photosynthetic symbionts (phototrophs) had higher abundances, wider ranges, and a wider spread of locations than taxa without symbionts (heterotrophs). In phototrophic assemblages, spatial turnover comprised both exchange and loss of taxa, and their richness was high across a broad range of environmental conditions. In contrast, heterotrophs were uncommon, had short ranges, and were located where energy supply was highest and disturbance lowest. Turnover between heterotrophic assemblages comprised taxonomic loss rather than exchange of taxa. The biodiversity patterns and differences between phototrophic and heterotrophic octocorals are similar to those recorded in more spatially limited studies of phototrophic sponges and hard corals, and heterotrophic sponges. This study therefore suggests that the association, or not, with photosynthetic symbionts, and spatial and environmental factors related to energy supply and disturbance are principal drivers of biodiversity, community composition, and ranges of coral reef benthos.

AB Plant ecologists have recognised the importance of solar radiation for decades but have difficulty measuring it on plots. Proxies recorded on the ground or geographical information system (GIS) indices processed with a digital elevation model (DEM) have generally been used. Here we compare the efficiency of different methods of estimating spatially distributed topographic solar radiation, from the simplest ones (proxies based on slope, and sine or cosine transformed values of aspect) to more elaborate ones using a GIS program suited to calculations of monthly clear sky and overcast solar radiation. We used a 50-m DEM to estimate solar radiation with these different methods for the whole of France (550,000 km(2)). Radiation indices were compared with ground measurements from meteorological stations and used to model the distribution of silver fir (Abies alba), sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus), and downy oak (Quercus pubescens), forest species known to be sensitive to light. Results show that sine and cosine of aspect, combined or not with slope, are inefficient at simulating solar radiation over large areas. Solar radiation, calculated for clear sky and especially including cloud cover, is more relevant, leading respectively to an R(2) of 0.46 and 0.78 between measured and predicted annual radiation. Calculation with cloud cover appears to be the most efficient index for improving distribution models for the three species studied. Slope and aspect transformations are less efficient than the GIS calculations, but the difference between these proxies decreased on a local scale. Using both with GIS solar radiation, cosine of aspect, with or without interaction with slope, slightly improves distribution models on a local scale, but this effect attenuates with increase in area studied. We conclude that the effect of proxies studied is scale-dependent, but GIS-based calculation including cloudiness variability is more appropriate than topographic proxies or clear sky models in estimating solar radiation and improving the efficiency of plant distribution models.

AB Human disturbance can be a severe problem for some animal species. Behavioural ecology theory predicts that sensitivity to mortality risks, and thereby to disturbance, will be related to life-history characteristics. Long-lived species with low reproductive rates are expected to have a high cost of predation and therefore avoid risks strongly. In this paper we quantify the effect of roads on the Andean condor (Vultur gryphus) using behavioural indicators. We used a pair wise design, offering condors standardized food patches near and far from roads simultaneously The patches consisted of dead adult shee We recorded. p. condors' behaviour when visiting each patch. This study establishes the versatility of behavioural indicators and their usefulness to study conservation problems. We found that, although near and far patches were discovered after similar times and there were similar numbers of condors in the vicinity of near and far patches, the use of patches differed strongly. In the patches far from roads many more condors came to feed, the average time spent per individual was longer, the proportion of time spent vigilant was lower, and the amount of food left uneaten on the carcasses was lower. These results strongly suggest that Andean condors clearly avoid roads, and behave in a way predicted from theory if they trade off safety for energy. This study shows that roads have stronger influence on the habitat use of Andean condors, than previously thought, and may be a significant problem for the species in populated areas.

AB Two kinds of approaches have been used for assessing conservation and fisheries-related effects of marine protected areas (MPAs): (i) statistical modelling based on field data and (ii) mathematical modelling quantifying the consequences of MPAs on the dynamics of populations, communities, and fisheries. Statistical models provide a diagnostic on the impact of MPAs on the ecosystem and resources; they are also needed for devising and assessing sampling designs for monitoring programs. Dynamic models enable exploration of the consequences of MPA designs and other management policies. We briefly review how each of these approaches has been implemented up to now in the literature and identify potential indicators of MPA effects that can be obtained from each approach to provide scientific advice for managers. Methodological gaps that impede the assessment of MPA effects and the construction of appropriate indicators are then discussed, and recent developments in this respect are presented. We finally propose ways to reconcile the two approaches based on their complementarity to derive suitable indicators to support decision making. In this respect, we suggest in addition that MPA managers should be associated from the beginning to the design and construction of indicators.

AB Many bird species respond to forestry, even at moderate intensities. In New Brunswick, Canada, the Brown Creeper exhibits a negative, threshold response to harvesting intensity. This study aimed to determine whether (a) the threshold found in Brown Creeper occurrence is lower than eventual thresholds in its nesting requirements, and whether (b) the conservation of this species could be achieved through moderate-intensity harvest systems. Creepers are particularly sensitive to forestry because they nest on snags with peeling bark and they mainly forage on large-diameter trees. In northern hardwood stands, we compared habitat structure at local- (r = 80 m) and neighbourhood-scales (r = 250 m) around nest sites and sites not used by creepers. Over two years, we found 76 nests, 66 of which were paired with unused sites for comparison. At the local scale, densities of trees >= 30 cm dbh and snags >= 10 cm dbh, and the probability of presence of potential nest sites were significantly higher near nests than at sites where no creepers were detected. At the neighbourhood scale, the area of untreated mature forest was significantly higher around nests. Variance decomposition indicated that habitat variables at the local scale accounted for the majority of explained variation in nest site selection. We also found significant thresholds in the densities of large trees (127/ha) and snags (56/ha), and in the area of mature forest (10.4 ha). The conservation of breeding populations of Brown Creepers may thus require densities of large trees nearly twice as high as those associated with its probability of presence. Such a target seems to be incompatible even with moderate-intensity harvesting. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Estuarine wetlands have received little study in dry tropical and subtropical areas despite the fact that unpredictable rainfall makes their temporal continuity tenuous. In fact, many of these wetlands exist for much of the time as isolated pools that are remnants of extensive areas of shallow water that occur during infrequent flooding. Among the most important functional components of estuarine wetlands are the multifaceted connections between wetland units, and between wetlands and adjacent habitats, that maintain wetland integrity and allow fish to access them as nurseries. As the principal determinants of the likelihood of recolonisation, these connections are critical to metapopulation dynamics. To understand the ways in which the unique patterns of connectivity in these wetlands influence metapopulation dynamics and the compositions of fish fauna, we investigated patterns of physical and biological connectivity among estuarine wetland pools in the Fitzroy River delta of Australia's dry subtropics. Ten wetland pools ranging in salinity from fresh to hyperhaline, and differing in periodicity of connection from weeks, through months, to years were sampled regularly from February 2004 to May 2005, using cast nets. There were 4 distinct categories of pools; isolated freshwater pools, in-stream freshwater pools, regularly connected poikilohaline pools (pools where salinity varied over time from close to fresh to hyperhaline) and infrequently connected poikilohaline pools. The catch per unit effort and size structures of fish fauna of the different pool categories reflected connectivity, which determined the extent to which both marine- and freshwater-spawned species could re-colonise pools following local extinction. Overall, factors related to recolonisation were more important than those related to extinction in determining fish assemblage structures. Moreover, in contrast to many other metapopulation situations many extinction factors were heavily influenced by connectivity rather than being independent of it.

AB Animals exploiting their familiar food items often avoid spatio-temporal aggregation with others by avoiding scents, less rewarding areas or visual contacts, thereby minimizing competition or interference when resources are replenished slowly in patches. When animals are searching or assessing available food sources, however, they may benefit from reducing sampling costs by following others at food sites. Therefore, animals may adjust their responses to others depending on their familiarity with foraging situations. Here, we conducted field experiments to test whether nectar-collecting bumble bees make this adjustment. We allowed free-foraging bees to choose between two inflorescences, one occupied by a conspecific bee and another unoccupied. When bees were presented with flowers of a familiar type, they avoided occupied inflorescences. In contrast, bees visited an occupied inflorescence when the flower type was unfamiliar. To our knowledge, this is the first report suggesting that animals adjust their responses to feeding conspecifics depending on their familiarity with food sources. Such behavioural flexibilities should allow foragers to both explore and exploit their environments efficiently.

AB Pleistocene sea-level fluctuations profoundly changed landmass configurations around northern Australia. The cyclic emergence of the Torres Strait land bridge and concomitant shifts in the distribution of shallow-water marine habitats repeatedly sundered east and west coast populations. These biogeographical perturbations invoke three possible scenarios regarding the directions of interglacial range expansion: west to east, east to west, or bidirectional. We evaluated these scenarios for the olive sea snake, Aipysurus laevis, by exploring its genetic structure around northern Australia based on 354 individuals from 14 locations in three regions (Western Australia, WA; Gulf of Carpentaria, GoC; Great Barrier Reef, GBR). A 726-bp fragment of the mitochondrial DNA ND4 region revealed 41 variable sites and 38 haplotypes, with no shared haplotypes among the three regions. Population genetic structure was strong overall, phi(ST) = 0.78, P < 0.001, and coalescent analyses revealed no migration between regions. Genetic diversity was low in the GBR and GoC and the genetic signatures of these regions indicated range or population expansions consistent with their recent marine transgressions around 7000 years ago. By contrast, genetic diversity on most WA reefs was higher and there were no signals of recent expansion events on these reefs. Phylogenetic analyses indicated that GBR and GoC haplotypes were derived from WA haplotypes; however, statistical parsimony suggested that recent range expansion in the GBR-GoC probably occurred from east coast populations, possibly in the Coral Sea. Levels of contemporary female-mediated gene flow varied within regions and reflected potential connectivity among populations afforded by the different regional habitat types.

AB Understanding the mechanisms that facilitate or inhibit invasion of exotic seaweeds is crucial in assessing the threat posed by their incursion and to define control options. In this paper, we consider how life history characteristics of the invading species and properties of the recipient environment influence the likelihood of invasion, giving particular emphasis to how disturbance influences the establishment, spread and persistence of introduced seaweed populations. Very few commonalities in key life history traits emerge since each species possesses a unique set of traits that confers a high capacity for invasiveness. Consequently, for seaweeds at least, predictions of invasibility based on life history characters alone are unlikely to be useful. In contrast, it is clear that disturbance is an important process in the establishment of these invasive species. With the possible exception of Caulerpa taxifolia, disturbance appears to be a critical factor that is either a key requirement (e.g., Codium fragile ssp. tomentosoides, Sargassum muticum and Undaria pinnatifida), or which accelerates (e.g., Fucus serratus) establishment and spread. The role of disturbance in the persistence of the invaders is more complex and depends on the species concerned. In several cases there is substantial evidence for positive feedback mechanisms that enable introduced species to persist in the absence of the disturbance factor that facilitated establishment in the first place. These circumstances define examples of ecological hystereses that pose particular challenges for management and control. The evidence suggests that, in several cases, preventing anthropogenically mediated disturbance to canopies of native seaweeds should be considered as a potential control option to minimise the risk of establishment of exotic species at high densities. However, for these kinds of introduced species, once they are established, control options that primarily target the disturbance are unlikely to represent viable management options.

AB We undertook analyses of mitochondrial DNA gene sequences and echolocation calls to resolve phylogenetic relationships among the related bat taxa Rhinolophus pusillus (sampled across China), R. monoceros (Taiwan), R. cornutus (main islands of Japan), and R. c. pumilus (Okinawa, Japan). Phylogenetic trees and genetic divergence analyses were constructed by combining new complete mitochondrial cytochrome-b gene sequences and partial mitochondrial control region sequences with published sequences. Our work showed that these 4 taxa formed monophyletic groups in the phylogenetic tree. However, low levels of sequence divergence among the taxa, together with similarities in body size and overlapping echolocation call frequencies, point to a lack of taxonomic distinctiveness. We therefore suggest that these taxa are better considered as geographical subspecies rather than distinct species, although this should not diminish the conservation importance of these island populations, which are important evolutionarily significant units. Based on our findings, we suggest that the similarities in body size and echolocation call frequency in these rhinolophids result from their recent common ancestry, whereas similarities in body size and call frequency with R. hipposideros of Europe are the result of convergent evolution.

AB Canopy photosynthesis models have predicted an optimal leaf area index ( LAI; leaf area per unit surface area) and leaf nitrogen distribution at which whole-plant carbon gain per unit N is maximized. In this study we experimentally tested these models, using transgenic P-SAG12-IPT tobacco ( SAG; Nicotiana tabacum L.) plants with delayed leaf senescence and therefore a greater LAI and more uniform N distribution than the wild type ( WT). In a competition experiment, the increased density of surrounding WT plants caused a greater reduction in dry mass of mature SAG target plants than in that of WT target plants, indicating negative effects of delayed leaf senescence on performance at high canopy density. Vegetative SAG plants achieved a lower calculated daily carbon gain than competing WT plants because the former retained leaves with a negative carbon gain in the shaded, lower part of the canopy. Sensitivity analyses showed that the carbon gain of SAG plants would increase if these lower leaves were shed and the N reallocated from these leaves were used to form additional leaf area at the canopy top. This strategy, which is adopted by the WT, is most advantageous because it results in the shading of competing neighbors.

AB Biodiversity issues have gained importance in forestry as a result of the increased awareness of forest landscape changes, but still there is much to do before forest management meets reasonable goals for forest protection and renewal of biodiversity. In this work, we focus on boreal forest landscapes, using Finland as a case study, and taking advantage of a valuable database-the National Forest Inventory (NFI). We explore a multicriteria approach by using a predictive habitat suitability model for three-toed woodpecker (Picoides tridactyius) based on Weights-of-Evidence (WofE) and a combination of remote sensing and field data derived from the Multisource Finnish National Forest Inventory (MS-NFI). The WofE model is a quantitative method used for combining evidence to examine the support for a given hypothesis. WE involves the estimation of a response variable (favourability for certain habitat occurrence) and a set of predictor variables (e.g. GIS layers containing environmental variables). WE is based on a log-linear form of Bayes' rule and uses the prior probability distribution and the likelihood of the data to generate a posterior probability distribution.
   Very few examples exist of WbfE being used to predict the spatial distribution of species or communities using biophysical descriptors. This work explores WofE as a tool for rapid biodiversity assessment using georeferenced species information. Since the method is dependent of the indicator species used as a surrogate of biodiversity value it can be applied for assessing biodiversity conditions of both managed and protected areas to help decision-making concerning protection of valuable habitats. Thus, the map of habitat suitability; represented as a range of probabilities of occurrence, offers an objective framework for evaluating the outcomes of different scenarios. Similarly, an objective assessment of habitat suitability provides a rational basis for management decisions incorporating impact on species habitat.

AB Intraspecific phylogenies can provide useful insights into how populations have been shaped by historical and contemporary processes. Taiwan formed around 5 million years ago from tectonic uplift, and has been connected to mainland Asia several times since its emergence. A central mountain range runs north to south, bisecting the island, and potentially impedes gene flow along an east-west axis. The Formosan lesser horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus monoceros) is endemic to Taiwan, where it is found mainly at low altitude. To determine the population structure and the demographic and colonization history of this species, we examined variation in the mitochondrial DNA control region in 203 bats sampled at 26 sites. We found very high haplotype and nucleotide diversity, which decreased from the centre to the south and north. Population differentiation followed a pattern of isolation by distance, though most regional genetic variance was attributable to differences between the relatively isolated southern population and those from other regions. A haplotype network was consistent with these findings and also suggested a southward colonization, followed by subsequent secondary contact between the south and other regions. Mismatch distributions were used to infer a past population expansion predating the last glacial maximum, and a neighbour-joining tree showed that R. monoceros formed a monophyletic grouping with respect to its sister taxa. Taken together, our results suggest that this taxon arose from a single period of colonization, and that demographic growth followed in the late Pleistocene. Current genetic structure reflects limited gene flow, probably coupled with stepwise colonization in the past. We consider explanations for the persistence of the species through multiple glacial maxima.

AB The degree of influence of environment, location and geography on the distribution of closely-related Jekelius nitidus and Jekelius hernandezi, coleopteran species endemic to the Iberian Peninsula, was examined. Niche envelope model predictions of probable absence points were based on available presence information. Presence-absence information for each of the two species was logistic-regressed against climate, altitude, lithology, spatial and river basin variables from each of 100 km(2) UTM Iberian Peninsula squares. Models predict that environmental conditions are suitable for both species in an area larger than that in which they have been found. The best-fitting environment model for J. nitidus, based on summer precipitation, area underlain by siliceous rocks, area with siliceous sediments and aridity index, explains more than 81% of total deviance. The final model, which includes spatial and river basin variables, accounts for nearly of 89% of total deviance. The best-fitting environment model for J. hernandezi, based on the area underlain by calcareous rocks, summer precipitation, aridity index, altitude and minimum annual temperature, explains 63% of total deviance. The final model based on both spatial and river basin variables accounts for nearly 70% of total deviance.
   Our results suggest that climate influences the distribution of both species similarly and that the acidic or basic nature of the substrate is the environment variable that most influences the occurrence of both species. The major degree of influence of river basin variables, together with lithologic variables, on the current distribution of both species may be due to the limited mobility of these flightless species.

AB We have studied levels and distribution of genetic variation in nine isolated populations of Brown trout in NW Spain. In the present study, we have tried to test the importance of preservation of genetic variability for the survival of a set of isolated Brown trout (Salmo trutta) populations from the same river drainage. We screened genetic variation in three different markers, mitochondrial, microsatellites and Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC), presumed to be under different selective pressures. Overall, genetic diversity varied considerably across populations and the distribution of genetic variation was similar at MHC and microsatellites; highly polymorphic populations at the microsatellite loci were also highly polymorphic at the MHC. We also observed high levels of differentiation among populations. Although we found evidence suggesting that balancing selection has influenced the long term evolution of the MHC, genetic drift seems to have eroded the effect of selection, becoming the predominant evolutionary force shaping genetic variation in some of the smaller populations. Despite current lack of variation at the MHC, these small populations seem to have remained viable for a long time.

AB We conducted an experiment to examine the effects of sex and food intake on growth, mass gain, and attainment of sexual maturity in Western Diamond-backed Rattlesnakes (Crotalus atrox). We also measured testosterone levels to determine whether testosterone might be involved in the male-biased sexual size dimorphism observed in this species. We collected neonate rattlesnakes and raised them in the laboratory for 2 years on either a high-intake diet (fed one mouse per week) or a low-intake diet (fed one mouse every 3 weeks). High-intake snakes grow and gained mass more rapidly than low-intake snakes, but males did not grow or gain mass more rapidly than females in either treatment group. High-intake snakes attained reproductive maturity earlier than low-intake snakes, indicating that size, not age, is the critical determinant of reproductive maturity. Males had higher levels of testosterone than females but did not grow more quickly, suggesting that testosterone may not affect growth in this species and may therefore not be the proximate determinant of sexual size dimorphism.

AB We have developed a new chtorophyllic cell line ('TADH-XO') from the highly water stress tolerant grass Bouteloua gracilis (blue grama). When grown under normal (non-stress) conditions, this new cell line accumulates higher levels of chlorophyll (up to 368.1 mu g total chlorophyll g(-1) FW) than a previously obtained cell line ('TIANSJ98'). Both cell lines are capable of developing substantially higher amounts of chlorophyll when subjected to osmotic stress. In order to explain these changes in the chlorophyll kinetics of the chlorophyttic cells, we analyzed the following population variables in cells subjected to polyethylene glycol 8000-induced osmotic stress: growth, viability, chlorophyll (total, 'a' and V), cell size, percentage of green cells and chloroplast (number and size). Although previous studies in some chtorophyllic cells of dicots have already reported that chlorophyll increases under saline stress, in this report we show that, at Least in this graminaceous cell line, the increase in chlorophyll is an immediate and proportional response to the osmotic stress applied and not the result of a progressive adaptation process. Consistent with previous studies, the increase in chlorophyll accumulation could be the result of chloroplast development (increased thylakoid number per chloroplast). On the basis of our results, the increases in chlorophyll accumulation previously observed in salt-adapted dicot cells may be the result of the osmotic shock (water deficit), rather than the ionic effect of salt on the physiology of chtorophyllic cells of dicots. Under the cell population experimental approach we followed, our study provides important insights related to the physiological behavior of chlorophyllic cells subjected to osmotic stress.

AB This article presents a historical review of the lobster and conch fisheries in Belize, Central America. In terms of yield and value, these are the main wild-caught targets of the national fisheries, a small-scale commercial fishery of around 3000 fishermen. Data were collected during interviews with key informants involved with the fisheries and through literature and archive research. The goal was to study how the fishing industry has responded to environmental signals from these resources and from their ecosystems and ecosystem dynamics. National yields for both lobster and conch have been relatively stable, however, individuals' yields have been declining despite increased effort since the 1980s. This study concludes that the use of fossil fuel-based technology and organizational change, with the establishment of fishermen's cooperatives, have masked environmental signals. This masking, together with economic incentives, has led to the "pathology of resource use." As a symptom of this pathology, four forms of sequential exploitation in these fisheries were identified. A major conclusion is that social resilience may not confer ecological resilience. The development of the cooperatives was needed in order to improve equity in the industry. Before their impacts could be assessed, this organizational change, together with new technology, led to very important and rapid changes in the industry. Together with existing regulations that allow de facto open access to lobster and conch, these changes resulted in a short-term boom that has resulted in the pathology of resource use, with over-capitalization and dependence on maintained yields, regardless of environmental feedback.

AB Temperature has a strong influence on the activity of living organisms. This study, involving two indoor experiments, evaluated the effects of root zone temperature (10, 15 and 23degreesC) on the formation and development of arbuscular mycorrhizae (AM). In the first trial, greenhouse-grown sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] was either colonized by Glomus intraradices Schenck & Smith or left non-mycorrhizal. Root length, root and shoot weight and root colonization were measured after 5, 10 and 15 weeks of plant growth. Although suboptimal root zone temperatures reduced growth in both mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal plants, mycorrhizal plants were larger than non-mycorrhizal plants after 15 weeks at 15 and 23degreesC. At suboptimal root zone temperatures, mycorrhizal inoculation sometimes slightly reduced root development. AM colonization was more affected than root growth at suboptimal root zone temperatures. Colonization was markedly reduced at 15degreesC compared with 23degreesC, and almost completely inhibited at 10degreesC. The second experiment was conducted in vitro using transformed carrot (Daucus carota L.) roots supporting G. intraradices. Mycelium length and spore number were measured weekly for 15 weeks. Spore metabolic activity (iodonitrotetrazolium reduction), root length and percentage root colonization were measured after 15 weeks. G. intraradices sporulation was reduced at temperatures below 23degreesC, while spore metabolic activity was significantly reduced only at 10degreesC. Root length and in particular percentage colonization were decreased at suboptimal temperatures. A negative interaction between AM hyphal growth and root growth resulting in reduced probability of contact at suboptimal root zone temperatures is proposed to explain the greater reduction observed in root colonization than in root and hyphal growth.

AB The evolutionary history of the endangered Knysna seahorse, Hippocampus capensis , and the extent of gene flow among its three known populations, were investigated using 138 mitochondrial DNA control region sequences. Similarly high levels of genetic diversity were found in two of the populations (Knysna and Keurbooms Estuaries), whereas diversity in the third population (Swartvlei Estuary) was lower. Although most haplotypes are shared between at least two populations, based on the haplotype frequency distributions the three assemblages constitute distinct management units. The extant population structure of H. capensis suggests that the Knysna seahorse originated in the large Knysna Estuary. The presence of seahorses in the two smaller estuaries is either the result of a vicariance event at the beginning of the present interglacial period, colonization of the estuaries via the sea, or a combination of the two.

AB Marine reserves are considered to be a central tool for marine ecosystem-based management in tropical inshore fisheries. The arguments supporting marine reserves are often based on both the nonmarket values of ecological amenities marine reserves provide and the pragmatic cost-saving advantages relating to reserve monitoring and enforcement. Marine reserves are, however, only one of a suite of possible policy options that might be used to achieve conservation and fisheries management objectives, and have rarely been the focus of rigorous policy analyses that consider a full range of economic costs and benefits, including the transaction costs of management. If credible analyses are not undertaken, there is a danger that current enthusiasm for marine reserves may wane as economic performance fails to meet presumed potential. Fully accounting for the value of ecological services flowing from marine reserves requires consideration of increased size and abundance of focal species within reserve boundaries, emigration of target species from reserves to adjacent fishing grounds, changes in ecological resilience, and behavioural responses of fishers to spatially explicit closures. Expanding policy assessments beyond standard cost-benefit analysis (CBA) also requires considering the impact of social capital on the costs of managing fisheries. In the short term, the amount of social capital that communities possess and the capacity of the state to support the rights of individuals and communities will affect the relative efficiency of marine reserves. Reserves may be the most efficient policy option when both community and state capacity is high, but may not be when one and/or the other is weak. in the longer term, the level of social capital that a society possesses and the level of uncertainty in ecological and social systems will also impact the appropriate level of devolution or decentralization of fisheries governance. Determining the proper balance of the state and the community in tropical fisheries governance will require broad comparative studies of marine reserves and alternative policy tools.

AB Island radiations can offer challenging systems for the implementation of conservation policies because descendent populations may exhibit different levels of adaptive divergence, reproductive isolation, and phylogenetic distinctiveness. This seems particularly true for the endangered Galapagos giant tortoises (Geochelone nigra), which comprise a lineage that radiated rapidly and concomitantly with the evolution of the archipelago. We used mitochondrial DNA sequences and microsatellite markers to investigate the genetic structure, and to reconstruct genealogical relationships and the history of population colonization of giant tortoises from the Islands of Santa Cruz and Pinzon, including samples of a basal taxon from the Island of San Cristobal. Populations displayed marked genetic divergence, contrasting demographic histories, and deep phylogeographic structure. The pattern of diversification among populations was consistent with geological and biogeographic history, and to some extent, with adaptive and morphological divergence. Results strongly indicate the presence of a minimum of four conservation units with long-standing evolutionary separation: two in Santa Cruz, one in Pinzon, and one in San Cristobal. We propose that these findings be effectively integrated with other existing data by the appropriate environmental agencies to evaluate current conservation efforts and implement new strategies aimed at protecting the integrity and diversity of giant tortoise populations.

AB We examined population structure of New Zealand sea urchins Evechinus chloroticus across the Doubtful-Thompson Sound complex, a fjord with a large influx of freshwater, a low salinity surface layer and a mean estuarine circulation. Measurements of abundance, growth, gonad development and larval settlement were collected at 9 sites. We observed large differences in each of these vital population parameters among sites. The highest growth rates and gamete production occurred at the entrances of the fjord. We used 3 alternative growth models to test whether the spatial pattern in growth rates was robust. Variability in growth among sites likely reflected differences in nutritional history, as indicated by the Aristotle's lantern index. Size distributions taken 2 yr apart at each of the 9 sites showed that the adult mode was relatively stable in time. As a consequence much of the variance in mean size among sites could be explained by differences in growth rather than in mortality or recruitment. The highest abundance and aggregation of sea urchins occurred at mid-fjord and entrance sites, which coincided with the highest rates of larval settlement and suggested limited larval supply elsewhere. The observed spatial patterns in vital rates were used to evaluate the likely influences of spatial heterogeneity in larval production on larval dispersal patterns within the fjord, based on particle movements within a validated hydrodynamic model. We then tested the sensitivity of these model results to magnitude of wind and rainfall events and duration of larval development. Results from our field observations and modeling studies suggest that the sea urchin population in Doubtful-Thompson Sound is likely composed of distinct areas of reproductive source and sink.

AB Restriction fragment length polymorphisms of mtDNA were used to assess genetic structure at two geographic scales for five species of Neotropical forest-understory birds. At the local scale (in northeastern Bolivia), I studied populations of each species from six sites within 200 kin of one another. At this scale, I studied the effects of forest fragmentation on mtDNA genetic structure: three sites were in natural forest fragments separated by cerrado (savanna), and three sites were in continuous forest. Genetic variation did not appear to have be-en lost in the forest fragment populations of any species, However, for three antbirds (Thamnophilidae), patterns of haplotype distributions suggest fragmentation affected genetic structure in an unusual way. For these species, numerically dominant haplotypes in forest fragments did not occur in continuous forest, v whereas predominant haplotypes in continuous forest are widespread (occurring in fragments and continuous forest). These results suggest that forest fragmentation on a local geographic scale can affect genetic differentiation even in birds, a group that is considered to disperse well, The two other taxa studied were a woodcreeper (Dendrocolaptidae) and a tyrant-flycatcher (Tyrannidae). These two taxa did not show genetic effects of forest fragmentation, but they possessed notably different numbers of haplotypes per total individuals surveyed. The woodcreeper had few haplotypes (5 in 58 individuals), whereas the flycatcher had many (31 in 34 individuals). The numbers of haplotypes per individuals surveyed for the three antbirds were intermediate. Such variable levels of polymorphism can greatly influence analyses of genetic structure, At the regional geographic scale (across southwestern Amazonia). the flycatcher exhibited lower levels of differentiation than the other taxa, Levels of estimated sequence divergence within the other four taxa are similar to levels of differentiation between species from other avian studies, suggesting that genetic diversity is underestimated by current species-level taxonomy in these birds.

AB Koalas have undergone a series of sequential founding events on islands in south-eastern Australia in recent times, Populations in South Australia at the Eyre Peninsula and Mt Lofty Ranges were founded in the 1960s from a colony on Kangaroo Island. The Kangaroo Is. colony was derived from animals introduced to French Island from mainland Victoria over a century ago. In this study, we first use microsatellite markers to quantify levels of genetic variation within the South Australian koala populations and the relatively unperturbed Strzelecki Ranges population from mainland Victoria. This analysis revealed low levels of allelic diversity (1.7 +/- 0.2 to 2.7 +/- 0.5) and heterozygosity (0.208 +/- 0.088 to 0.340 +/- 0.110) in the three South Australian koala populations relative to the Strzelecki Ranges population, which has the highest levels of allelic diversity (4.7 +/- 1.1) and heterozygosity (0.476 +/- 0.122) in Victoria. Second, we measured the incidence of testicular aplasia, a unilateral or bilateral failure in testicular development, in the Eyre Peninsula and Kangaroo Is. populations, and in the ultimate founding population at French Is. Testicular aplasia was present at a frequency of 4.3% in French Is., 12.8% in Kangaroo is. and 23.9% in the Eyre Peninsula, but was undetectable in the non-bottle necked Pilliga State Forest population of New South Wales. The incidence of testicular aplasia correlated positively with effective inbreeding coefficients derived from heterozygosity values (0.13 +/- 0.06 in the Pilliga State Forest, 0.57 +/- 0.17 in French Is., 0.63 +/- 0.12 on Kangaroo Is. and 0.77 +/- 0.12 in the Eyre Peninsula), which may indicate inbreeding depression. These findings are of concern when evaluating the long-term conservation and viability of the South Australian koala populations, which may benefit from genetic augmentation in the future. Finally, unconfirmed reports suggested that animals from other states in Australia were introduced into the Mt Lofty Ranges population. Therefore, we quantified differentiation between the three South Australian populations and the Strzelecki Ranges and French Is. populations, based on microsatellites and mtDNA d-loop region variation. R-statistics and Goldstein's delta mu square distance revealed that differentiation at nuclear loci between populations paralleled known recent population history, except for the close relationship between Mt Lofty Ranges and French Is. This suggested a recent contribution to the Mt Lofty Ranges populations of animals derived from the French Is. translocation program. Furthermore, mtDNA d-loop analysis found no evidence of contributions to the gene pool from animals of New South Wales or Queensland stock, implying that the population was derived exclusively from Victorian stock.

AB Morphological observations and molecular analyses of the red alga Grateloupia filicina (Halymeniaceae) from two geographically distant regions, eastern Asia (Japan and northern China) in the northwestern Pacific and Italy in the Mediterranean, reveal the presence of two distinct entities. Morphologically, the eastern Asian entity differs substantially from the Italian entity in the following ways: 1) thin and soft thalli with wider axes, 2) denser medullary filaments, 3) scattered reproductive structures over the entire thallus, and 4) a mature auxiliary cell that is oval and slightly larger than other ampullary cells. Phylogenetic analysis based on the ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase gene (rbcL) sequences revealed that the eastern Asian and Italian entities are phylogenetically far apart, strongly supporting the differentiation of these two entities at the species level. The eastern Asian entity is therefore described as a new species, Grateloupia asiatica. This species can be distinguished from most known species of Grateloupia that have widely flattened thalli by its compressed to narrowly flattened axes with numerous pinnate proliferations and from a few species with similar thalli by a particular combination of features, including a gelatinous texture, mostly simple and narrower axes, a thinner cortex, and the absence of catenate proliferations.

AB The influence of leaf orientation and position within shoots on individual leaf light environments, carbon gain, and susceptibility to photoinhibition was studied in the California chaparral shrub Heteromeles arbutifolia with measurements of gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence, and by application of a three-dimensional canopy architecture model. Simulations of: light absorption and photosynthesis revealed a complex pattern of leaf light environments and resulting leaf carbon gain within the shoots. Upper, south-facing leaves were potentially the most productive because they intercepted greater daily photon flux density (PFD) than leaves of any other orientation. North-facing leaves intercepted less PFD but of this, more was received on the abaxial surface because of the steep leaf angles. Leaves differed in their response to abaxial versus adaxial illumination depending on their orientation. While most had lower photosynthetic rates when illuminated on their abaxial as compared to adaxial surface, the photosynthetic rates of north-facing leaves were independent of the surface of illumination. Because of the increasing self-shading, there were strong decreases in absorbed PFD and daily carbon gain in the basipetal direction. Leaf nitrogen per unit mass also decreased in the basipetal direction but on a per unit area basis was nearly constant along the shoot. The decrease in leaf N per unit mass was accounted for by an increase in leaf mass per unit area (LMA) rather than by movement of N from older to younger leaves during shoot growth. The increased LMA of older lower leaves may have contributed directly to their lower photosynthetic capacities by increasing the limitations to diffusion of CO2 within the leaf to the sites of carboxylation. There was no evidence for sun/shade acclimation along the shoot. Upper leaves and especially south-facing upper leaves had a potential risk for photoinhibition as demonstrated by the high PFDs received and the diurnal decreases in the fluorescence ratio F-v/F-m. Predawn F-v/F-m ratios remained high (> 0.8) indicating that when in their normal orientations, leaves sustained no photoinhibition. Reorientation of the leaves to horizontal induced a strong sustained decrease in F-v/F-m and CO2 exchange that slowly recovered over the next 10-15 days. If leaves were also inverted so that: the abaxial surface received the increased PFDs, then the reduction in F-v/F-m and CO2 assimilation was much greater with no evidence for recovery. The heterogeneity of responses was due to a combination of differences between leaves of different orientation, differences between responses on their abaxial versus adaxial surfaces, and differences along the shoot due to leaf age and self-shading effects.

AB We compared the ectomycorrhizal community structure of oak forest stands located in either an urban or a rural area. Urban stands had higher N deposition rates, soil heavy metal levels, and earthworm counts than rural stands. Ectomycorrhizal types were quantified on roots of mature oak (Quercus) in soil cores and on Quercus rubra L. seedlings grown in soil cores in the glasshouse. Twenty-six ectomycorrhizal types were distinguished on mature oak in rural soils versus 16 in urban soils. Nine ectomycorrhizal types were distinguished on Q. rubra seedlings grown in rural soils versus seven in urban soils. Despite fewer ectomycorrhizal types in urban soils, richness of ectomycorrhizal types per centimetre fine root of mature oak or Q. rubra seedlings did not differ between urban and rural soils. Ectomycorrhizal colonization (ectomycorrhizal tips/m fine root) was lower in urban than rural soil cores but higher on Q. rubra seedlings grown in urban versus rural soils. Fine root length per unit soil volume was higher in urban than rural stands. No difference in fine root length was observed between Q. rubra seedlings grown in urban and rural soils. These differences in ectomycorrhizal community structure between the urban and rural stands are likely due to anthropogenic impacts.

AB In sparsely cropped farming systems in semi-arid tropics, rainfall partitioning can be complex due to various interactions between vertical and horizontal water flows, both in the atmosphere and in the soil. Despite this, quantifying the seasonal rainfall partitioning is essential, in order to identify options for increased yields. Results are presented on water flow components, based on field measurements and water balance modelling, for three years (1994-96) in a farmer's field cultivated with pearl millet [Pennisetum glaucum (L.) Br.] in the Sahel (Niger). Water balance modelling was carried out for three common infiltration categories: runoff producing surfaces, surfaces receiving inflow of runon water from upstream zones, and a reference surface with zero runoff and runon. Runoff was calculated to 25%-30% of annual rainfall (which ranged from 488 to 596 mm), from crust observations, rainfall, soil wetness data, and infiltration estimates. Inflow of runon was estimated from field observations to 8%-18% of annual rainfall. The parameters in the functions for soil surface and canopy resistances were calibrated with field measurements of soil evaporation, stomatal conductance and leaf area. The model estimates of soil water contents, which were validated against neutron probe measurements, showed a reasonable agreement with observed data, with a root mean square error (RMSE) of approximately 0.02 m(3) m(-3) for 0-160 cm soil depth. Estimated productive water flow as plant transpiration was low, amounting to 4%-9% of the available water for the non-fertilised crop and 79%-24% for the fertilised crop. Soil evaporation accounted for 31%-50% of the available water, and showed a low variation for the observed range of leaf area (LAI <1 m(2) m(-2)). Deep percolation was high, amounting to 200-330 mm for the non-crusted surfaces, which exceeded soil evaporation losses, for 1994-95 with relatively high annual rainfall (517-596 mm). Even a year with lower rainfall (488 mm) and a distinct dry spell during flowering (1996), resulted in an estimated deep percolation of 160 mm for the non-fertilised crop. The crop did not benefit from the additional inflow of runon water, which was partitioned between soil water storage and deep percolation. The only exception to this was the fertilised crop in 1996, where runon somewhat compensated for the limited rainfall and the higher water demand as a result of a larger leaf area than the non-fertilised crop. The effects of rainfall erraticness, resulting in episodic droughts, explain why a crop that uses such a small proportion of the available water, in an environment with substantial deep percolation, still suffers from water scarcity. Application of small levels of phosphorus and nitrogen roughly doubled yields, from 380 to 620 kg ha(-1), and plant transpiration, from 33 to 78 mm. Evapotranspirational water use efficiency (WUEET) was low, 6500-8300 m(3) ton(-1) grain for non-fertilised crop, which is an effect of the low on-farm yields and high non-productive water losses. The estimated seasonal rainfall partitioning indicates the possibility of quantifying vertical water hows in on-farm environments in the Sahel, despite the presence of surface overland flow.

AB Naturally seeded Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) trees, age 25-30 years, were subjected to two soil-nitrogen-supply regimes and to elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations by the branch-in-bag method from April 15 to September 15 for two or three years. Gas exchange in detached shoots was measured in a diffuse radiation field. Seven parameters associated with photosynthetic performance and two describing stomatal conductance were determined to assess the effects of treatments on photosynthetic components. An elevated concentration of CO2 did not lead to a significant downward regulation in maximum carboxylation rate (V-cmax) or maximum electron transport rate (J(max)), but it significantly decreased light-saturated stomatal conductance (g(sat)) and increased minimum stomatal conductance (g(min)). Light-saturated rates of CO2 assimilation were higher (24-31 %) in shoots grown and measured at elevated CO2 concentration than in shoots grown and measured ured at ambient CO2 concentration, regardless of treatment time or nitrogen-supply regime. High soil-nitrogen supply significantly increased photosynthetic capacity, corresponding to significant increases in V-cmax and J(max). However, the combined elevated CO2 + high nitrogen-supply treatment did not enhance the photosynthetic response above that observed in the elevated CO2 treatment alone.

AB Buckmoths (Hemileuca spp.) are day-flying saturniid moths with diverse ecologies and host plants. Populations that feed on Menyanthes trifoliata, known commonly as Cryan's buckmoths, have been found in only a few bogs and fens near eastern Lake Ontario in New York and near Ottawa in Ontario, Canada. Because of their unique ecological traits, geographic isolation from other Hemileuca populations and the small number of sites they occupy, there is concern that the Cryan's buckmoth populations are phylogenetically distinct and should be protected. The Cryan's buckmoths have not yet been taxonomically described and do not appear to have clear distinguishing morphological characters. Both molecular genetic traits (allozymes and mitochondrial DNA sequences) and an ecologically based character (host performance) were investigated to determine whether these populations possess fixed diagnostic characters signifying genetic differentiation from other eastern Hemileuca populations. Such differences would merit separate conservation management as an evolutionarily significant unit. Our studies showed that the Cryan's buckmoths clearly belong to the Hemileuca maia species group, but they could not be readily distinguished from other members of that group by means of molecular genetic techniques. There were no fixed differences in alleles or haplotypes distinguishing any of the populations or species, suggesting-recent divergence. Nonetheless, in the host-plant performance experiment only the Cryan's buckmoth larvae were able to develop on M. trifoliata, a significant difference from other Hemileuca larvae tested. The Cryan's buckmoth appears to be unique in host performance and warrants protection and management as an evolutionarily significant unit. In cases such as this where groups appear to have recently diverged, investigations into ecologically significant traits may provide indicators of conservation significance as reliable as molecular genetic markers.

AB Iron nutrient deficiency was investigated in leaves of hydroponically grown sugar beets (Beta vulgaris) to determine how ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) gene expression is affected when thylakoid components of photosynthesis are diminished. Rubisco polypeptide content was reduced by 60% in severely iron-stressed leaves, and the reduction was directly correlated to chlorophyll content. The concentration of Rubisco protein in iron-stressed leaves was found to be regulated by availability of mRNAs, and CO2 fixation by Rubisco was reduced from 45 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1) in extracts from iron-sufficient leaves to 20 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1) in extracts from severely stressed leaves. The rate of CO2 fixation was directly correlated to leaf chlorophyll content. Rubisco in iron-sufficient control leaves was 59% activated, whereas in severely stressed leaves grown under the same light, Rubisco was 43% activated. RNA synthesis was reduced by about 50% in iron-deficient leaves, but 16S and 25S rRNA and ctDNA were essentially unaffected by iron stress.

AB This study examines the effect of leaf age on photosynthesis, transpiration and nitrogen concentration in four deciduous (DC) and two evergreen (EG) species coexisting in a tropical dry forest of Venezuela. Leaf age was characterized on the basis of leaf chorophyll, nitrogen content, and construction and maintenance costs. The mean leaf area-based nitrogen concentration (N) in EG was about twice that in DC species. A leaf age effect was observed in both DC and EG species, with largest N concentration in mature leaves. Fractional leaf N allocation to chlorophyll was higher in the DC than in the EG species. Differences in the construction costs of leaf mass between the youngest and the oldest leaves averaged from 2.14 to 1.55 g glucose g-1 dry weight. Although variation in area-based leaf maintenance and construction costs between DC and EG species existed, they were, nevertheless, positively correlated. Individual data sets, for each species, indicated that leaf N and maximum rate of photosynthesis (A(max)) were linearly related. Nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) and water use efficiency (WUE) tended to be higher in mature leaves than in expanding and old leaves. Moreover, DC species always had higher NUE than EG species. Intercellular to ambient pressures of CO2 (P(i)/P(a)) were related to WUE in a negative manner. Higher P(i)/P(a) values were observed in expanding and old leaves. Leaf age effect on photosynthesis was, therefore, due to greater decline of carbon fixation capacity by mesophyll tissue relative to the decline in stomatal conductance in youngest and oldest leaves.

AB Carex acutiformis and Brachypodium pinnatum were grown with a uniform distribution of photosynthetic photon flux density (PFD) with height, and in a vertical PFD gradient similar to the PFD gradient in a leaf canopy. Distribution of organic leaf N and light-saturated rates of photosynthesis were determined. These parameters were also determined on plants growing in a natural vegetation stand. The effect of a PFD gradient was compared with the effect of a leaf canopy. In Brachypodium, plants growing in a vegetation stand had increasing leaf N with plant height. However, distribution of leaf N was not influenced by the PFD gradient treatment. The gradient of leaf N in plants growing in a leaf canopy was not due to differences within the long, mostly erect, leaves but to differences between leaves. In Carex, however, the PFD gradient caused a clear increase of leaf N with height in individual leaves and thus also in plants. The leaf N gradient was similar to that of plants growing in a leaf canopy. Leaf N distribution was not affected by nutrient availability in Carex. In most cases, photosynthesis was positively related to leaf N. Hence, light-saturated rates of photosynthesis increased towards the top of the plants growing in leaf canopies in both species and, in Carex, also in the PFD gradient, thus contributing to increased N use efficiency for photosynthesis of the whole plant. It is concluded that in Carex the PFD gradient is the main environmental signal for leaf N allocation in response to shading in a leaf canopy, but one or more other signals must be involved in Brachypodium.

AB Growth strategies are described of five emergent macrophytes, Ludwigia peploides (H. B. K.) Raven, Myriophyllum aquaticum (Vellozo) Verdcourt, Nasturtium officinale R. Br., Hydrocotyle verticillata Thunb., and Oenanthe sarmentosa Presl, which commonly occur in nutrient rich pools, sloughs, and irrigation and drainage canals throughout central and southern California. Because of their creeping mode of growth, the term 'creeping emergents' is suggested. These plants are characterized by rapid growth, high nitrogen accumulation, allocation of most biomass and nitrogen into aboveground plant parts, and rapid decomposition.
   Experiments on L. peploides showed it to be capable of producing up to 50 g dry weight m-2 day-1. In natural stands its average biomass is usually in the range 500-700 g dry weight m-2. In cultivation, with an artificial stem support, it attained a positive growth rate even at high densities, and a biomass corresponding to 1900 g dry weight m-2. It grew well in a broad range of nitrogen concentrations, its biomass production staying approximately the same through the range 20-140 mg l-1 of nitrate-nitrogen in water. Whole plant nitrogen content reached a maximum of 4.5% leaf nitrogen of 6.8%. The rate of photosynthesis decreased in leaves with nitrogen concentrations > 5.5%. L. peploides regenerated well after 95% of the stem length was removed, regaining 67% of biomass of the uncut control in 45 days. Creeping emergents have good potential for use in waste water treatment.

AB The various steps involved in experimental investigations of the. causes of observed ecological patterns are examined. A sequence of different steps (observation, model, hypothesis, null hypothesis, test) is identifiable. The logical necessity for distinguishing and evaluating each of these steps is discussed. The potential usefulness of explicit recognition of the logical relationships between the various parts of the procedure is evaluated by reference to experimental studies to determine the causes of boundaries of vertical distribution of macro-algae in rocky intertidal habitats. Pitfalls of experimental procedures can sometimes be recognized as failures in the logical progress from one part to the next in the sequence of steps necessary in any study. Particularly important is the early recognition of the existence of many, potentially conflicting, but sometimes interactive, models to account for any observed pattern. Greater attention to the relationships between the components of the logical structure of an experimental study might aid in reduction of errors in the design, analysis and interpretation of ecological experimental data.

AB Ammonium sulphate is a major component of the air pollutants deposited on forests in the Netherlands. Different amounts of NH4+ were added to Douglas-fir seedlings grown in tall containers of sand, to study the influence of high concentrations of NH4+ in the soil on the development of fine roots and the effects of nitrogen uptake on rhizosphere pH. At the end of this eight-month experiment part of the ammonium appeared to have nitrified into nitrate. High doses of ammonium negatively affected root length and root length per unit of dry matter (specific root length). Although Douglas fir shows a preferential ammonium uptake in nutrient solutions the increase in the pH of the rhizosphere in this experiment indicate that nitrogen was mostly taken up as nitrate. When the ammonium concentration in the soil is low, it cannot be taken up readily because of its low mobility in soil. Shoot growth was stimulated by high availability of nitrogen. The possible effects of high doses of ammonium on long-term forest vitality are discussed.

AB Tropical ecosystems have the highest levels of biodiversity, cycle more water and absorb more carbon than any other terrestrial ecosystem on Earth. Consequently, these ecosystems are extremely important components of Earth's climatic system and biogeochemical cycles. Plant hydraulics is an essential discipline to understand and predict the dynamics of tropical vegetation in scenarios of changing water availability. Using published plant hydraulic data we show that the trade-off between drought avoidance (expressed as deep-rooting, deciduousness and capacitance) and hydraulic safety (P50 - the water potential when plants lose 50% of their maximum hydraulic conductivity) is a major axis of physiological variation across tropical ecosystems. We also propose a novel and independent axis of hydraulic trait variation linking vulnerability to hydraulic failure (expressed as the hydraulic safety margin (HSM)) and growth, where inherent fast-growing plants have lower HSM compared to slow-growing plants. We surmise that soil nutrients are fundamental drivers of tropical community assembly determining the distribution and abundance of the slow-safe/fast-risky strategies. We conclude showing that including either the growth-HSM or the resistance-avoidance trade-off in models can make simulated tropical rainforest communities substantially more vulnerable to drought than similar communities without the trade-off. These results suggest that vegetation models need to represent hydraulic trade-off axes to accurately project the functioning and distribution of tropical ecosystems.

AB Streamflow observations can be used to understand, predict, and contextualize hydrologic, ecological, and biogeochemical processes and conditions in streams. Stream gages are point measurements along rivers where streamflow is measured, and are often used to infer upstream watershed-scale processes. When stream gages read zero, this may indicate that the stream has dried at this location; however, zero-flow readings can also be caused by a wide range of other factors. Our ability to identify whether or not a zero-flow gage reading indicates a dry fluvial system has far reaching environmental implications. Incorrect identification and interpretation by the data user can lead to inaccurate hydrologic, ecological, and/or biogeochemical predictions from models and analyses. Here, we describe several causes of zero-flow gage readings: frozen surface water, flow reversals, instrument error, and natural or human-driven upstream source losses or bypass flow. For these examples, we discuss the implications of zero-flow interpretations. We also highlight additional methods for determining flow presence, including direct observations, statistical methods, and hydrologic models, which can be applied to interpret causes of zero-flow gage readings and implications for reach- and watershed-scale dynamics. Such efforts are necessary to improve our ability to understand and predict surface flow activation, cessation, and connectivity across river networks. Developing this integrated understanding of the wide range of possible meanings of zero-flows will only attain greater importance in a more variable and changing hydrologic climate.

AB The plant economics spectrum is increasingly recognized as a major determinant of plant species effects on terrestrial ecosystem functioning related to carbon cycling. However, the role of plant economic strategies in the effects of living root activity on soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics through rhizodeposition remains unexplored, despite SOC being the largest terrestrial carbon pool. Using a continuous C-13-labelling method allowing partitioning of plant and soil sources to carbon fluxes and pools, we studied here the linkages between plant economic strategies and SOC cycling processes in a 'common garden' greenhouse experiment. It includes a panel of 12 grassland species selected along a gradient of economic traits and belonging to three functionnal groups (C3 grasses, forbs and legumes). All species induced an acceleration of native SOC mineralization but this rhizosphere priming effect (RPE) substantially differed across species and varied eleven-fold by the end of the experiment (from +26% to +295% relative to unplanted soil). Interspecific variation in RPE was primarily linked to plant photosynthetic activity associated to species economic strategies of light and CO2 resource acquisition and processing. Fast-growing acquisitive species, such as legumes, featured large RPE, in relation with their high canopy photosynthesis coupled to high leaf photosynthetic capacity and large net primary productivity allocated above-ground. This large RPE was further associated with high root metabolic activity, rhizodeposition and soil microbial activity. In contrast, fine-root growth and economic traits related to soil resource foraging ability were poor predictors of RPE. The formation of new root-derived SOC varied nine-fold across species and was similarly positively related to the net primary productivity allocated above-ground. Fast-growing acquisitive species with a high photosynthetic activity induced a disproportionately large RPE relative to SOC formation. Synthesis. Overall, our study demonstrates that rhizodeposition is a major mechanism through which plant economic strategies of grassland species control soil carbon dynamics. Acquisitive versus conservative species were associated with high versus low rates of photosynthesis and rhizodeposition, in turn leading to fast versus slow SOC turnover. This emphasizes the importance of considering rhizosphere processes for understanding plant species effects on soil biogeochemistry.

AB Wildfire refugia (unburnt patches within large wildfires) are important for the persistence of fire-sensitive species across forested landscapes globally. A key challenge is to identify the factors that determine the distribution of fire refugia across space and time. In particular, determining the relative influence of climatic and landscape factors is important in order to understand likely changes in the distribution of wildfire refugia under future climates. Here, we examine the relative effect of weather (i.e. fire weather, drought severity) and landscape features (i.e. topography, fuel age, vegetation type) on the occurrence of fire refugia across 26 large wildfires in south-eastern Australia. Fire weather and drought severity were the primary drivers of the occurrence of fire refugia, moderating the effect of landscape attributes. Unburnt patches rarely occurred under 'severe' fire weather, irrespective of drought severity, topography, fuels or vegetation community. The influence of drought severity and landscape factors played out most strongly under 'moderate' fire weather. In mesic forests, fire refugia were linked to variables that affect fuel moisture, whereby the occurrence of unburnt patches decreased with increasing drought conditions and were associated with more mesic topographic locations (i.e. gullies, pole-facing aspects) and vegetation communities (i.e. closed-forest). In dry forest, the occurrence of refugia was responsive to fuel age, being associated with recently burnt areas (<5 years since fire). Overall, these results show that increased severity of fire weather and increased drought conditions, both predicted under future climate scenarios, are likely to lead to a reduction of wildfire refugia across forests of southern Australia. Protection of topographic areas able to provide long-term fire refugia will be an important step towards maintaining the ecological integrity of forests under future climate change.

AB Spatial processes are central to many ecological processes, but fitting models that incorporate spatial correlation to data from ecological surveys is computationally challenging. This is particularly true of point pattern data (in which the primary data are the locations at which target species are found), but also true of gridded data, and of georeferenced samples from continuous spatial fields. We describe here the R package inlabru that builds on the widely used RINLA package to provide easier access to Bayesian inference from spatial point process, spatial count, gridded, and georeferenced data, using integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA, Rue et al., 2009). The package provides methods for fitting spatial density surfaces and estimating abundance, as well as for plotting and prediction. It accommodates data that are points, counts, georeferenced samples, or distance sampling data. This paper describes the main features of the package, illustrated by fitting models to the gorilla nest data contained in the package spatstat (Baddeley, & Turner, 2005), a line transect survey dataset contained in the package dsm (Miller, Rexstad, Burt, Bravington, & Hedley, 2018), and to a georeferenced sample from a simulated continuous spatial field.

AB The presence of defects like gas bubble in fabricated parts is inherent in the selective laser sintering process and the prediction of bubble shrinkage dynamics is crucial. In this paper, two artificial intelligence (AI) models based on Decision Trees algorithm were constructed in order to predict bubble dissolution time, namely the Ensemble Bagged Trees (EDT Bagged) and Ensemble Boosted Trees (EDT Boosted). A metadata including 68644 data were generated with the help of our previously developed numerical tool. The AI models used the initial bubble size, external domain size, diffusion coefficient, surface tension, viscosity, initial concentration, and chamber pressure as input parameters, whereas bubble dissolution time was considered as output variable. Evaluation of the models' performance was achieved by criteria such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and coefficient of determination (R-2). The results showed that EDT Bagged outperformed EDT Boosted. Sensitivity analysis was then conducted thanks to the Monte Carlo approach and it was found that three most important inputs for the problem were the diffusion coefficient, initial concentration, and bubble initial size. This study might help in quick prediction of bubble dissolution time to improve the production quality from industry.

AB Forests play a key role in regulating the global carbon cycle, and yet the abiotic and biotic conditions that drive the demographic processes that underpin forest carbon dynamics remain poorly understood in natural ecosystems. To address this knowledge gap, we used repeat forest inventory data from 92,285 trees across four large permanent plots (4-25 ha in size) in temperate mixed forests in northeast China to ask the following questions: (1) How do soil conditions and stand age drive biomass demographic processes? (2) How do vegetation quality (i.e., functional trait diversity and composition) and quantity (i.e., initial biomass stocks) influence biomass demographic processes independently from soil conditions and stand age? (3) What is the relative contribution of growth, recruitment, and mortality to net biomass change? Using structural equation modeling, we showed that all three demographic processes were jointly constrained by multiple abiotic and biotic factors and that mortality was the strongest determinant on net biomass change over time. Growth and mortality, as well as functional trait diversity and the community-weighted mean of specific leaf area (CWMSLA), declined with stand age. By contrast, high soil phosphorous concentrations were associated with greater functional diversity and faster dynamics (i.e., high growth and mortality rates), but associated with lower CWMSLA and initial biomass stock. More functionally diverse communities also had higher recruitment rates, but did not exhibit faster growth and mortality. Instead, initial biomass stocks and CWMSLA were stronger predictors of biomass growth and mortality, respectively. By integrating the full spectrum of abiotic and biotic drivers of forest biomass dynamics, our study provides critical system-level insights needed to predict the possible consequences of regional changes in forest diversity, composition, structure and function in the context of global change.

AB The ability of ecological niche models (ENMs) to produce robust predictions for different time frames (i.e. temporal transferability) may be hindered by a lack of ecologically relevant predictors. Model performance may also be affected by species traits, which may reflect different responses to processes controlling species distribution. In this study, we tested four primary hypotheses involving the role of species traits and environmental predictors in ENM performance and transferability. We compared the predictive accuracy of ENMs based upon (1) climate, (2) land-use/cover (LULC) and (3) ecosystem functional attributes (EFAs), and (4) the combination of these factors for 27 bird species within and beyond the time frame of model calibration. The combination of these factors significantly increased both model performance and transferability, highlighting the need to integrate climate, LULC and EFAs to improve biodiversity projections. However, the overall model transferability was low (being only acceptable for less than 25% of species), even under a hierarchical modelling approach, which calls for great caution in the use of ENMs to predict bird distributions under global change scenarios. Our findings also indicate that positive effects of species traits on predictive accuracy within model calibration are not necessarily translated into higher temporal transferability.

AB Despite their importance, how plant communities and soil microorganisms interact to determine the capacity of ecosystems to provide multiple functions simultaneously (multifunctionality) under climate change is poorly known. We conducted a common garden experiment using grassland species to evaluate how plant functional structure and soil microbial (bacteria and protists) diversity and abundance regulate soil multifunctionality responses to joint changes in plant species richness (one, three and six species) and simulated climate change (3 degrees C warming and 35% rainfall reduction). The effects of species richness and climate on soil multifunctionality were indirectly driven via changes in plant functional structure and their relationships with the abundance and diversity of soil bacteria and protists. More specifically, warming selected for the larger and most productive plant species, increasing the average size within communities and leading to reductions in functional plant diversity. These changes increased the total abundance of bacteria that, in turn, increased that of protists, ultimately promoting soil multifunctionality. Our work suggests that cascading effects between plant functional traits and the abundance of multitrophic soil organisms largely regulate the response of soil multifunctionality to simulated climate change, and ultimately provides novel experimental insights into the mechanisms underlying the effects of biodiversity and climate change on ecosystem functioning.

AB Despite decades of interest, few studies have provided evidence supporting theoretical expectations for coupled relationships between aboveground and belowground diversity and ecosystem functioning in non-manipulated natural ecosystems. We characterized plant species richness and density, soil bacterial, fungal and eukaryotic species richness and phylogenetic diversity (using 16S, ITS, and 18S gene sequencing), and ecosystem function (levels of soil C and N, and rates of microbial enzyme activities) along a natural gradient in plant richness and density in high-elevation, C-deficient soils to examine the coupling between above- and belowground systems. Overall, we observed a strong positive relationship between aboveground (plant richness and density) and belowground (bacteria, fungi, and non-fungal eukaryotes) richness. In addition to the correlations between plants and soil communities, C and N pools, and rates of enzyme activities increased as plant and soil communities became richer and more diverse. Our results suggest that the theoretically expected positive correlation between above- and belowground communities does exist in natural systems, but may he undetectable in late successional ecosystems due to the buildup of legacy organic matter that results in extremely complex belowground communities. In contrast, microbial communities in early successional systems, such as the system described here, are more directly dependent on contemporary inputs from plants and therefore are strongly correlated with plant diversity and density.

AB Many populations of elasmobranchs (sharks and rays) are experiencing severe declines due to the high demand for shark fins in Asia, the activities of unregulated fisheries, and increases in shark and ray catches. Recently, the effects of the decline in the populations of marine fish species on genetic diversity have drawn increasing attention; however, only a few studies have addressed the genetic diversity of shark and ray populations. Here, we report the results of a quantitative analysis of the genetic diversity of shark and ray species over the past 20 years and discuss the importance and utility of this genetic information for fisheries management and conservation policies. Furthermore, we suggest future actions important for minimizing the gaps in our current knowledge of the genetic diversity of shark and ray species and to minimize the information gap between genetic scientists and policymakers. We suggest that shark and ray fisheries management and conservation policies consider genetic diversity information, such as the management unit, effective population size (Ne), haplotype and nucleotide diversity, observed heterozygosity, and allelic richness, because the long-term survival of a species is strongly dependent on the levels of genetic diversity within and between populations. In addition, sharks and rays are a group of particular interest for genetic conservation due to their remarkable life histories.

AB Tests for isolation by distance (IBD) are the most commonly used method of assessing spatial genetic structure. Many studies have exclusively used mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences to test for IBD, but this marker is often in conflict with multilocus markers. Here, we report a review of the literature on IBD, with the aims of determining (a) whether significant IBD is primarily a result of lumping spatially discrete populations, and (b) whether microsatellite datasets are more likely to detect IBD when mtDNA does not. We also provide empirical data from four species in which mtDNA failed to detect IBD by comparing these with microsatellite and SNP data. Our results confirm that IBD is mostly found when distinct regional populations are pooled, and this trend disappears when each is analysed separately. Discrepancies between markers were found in almost half of the studies reviewed, and microsatellites were more likely to detect IBD when mtDNA did not. Our empirical data rejected the lack of IBD in the four species studied, and support for IBD was particularly strong for the SNP data. We conclude that mtDNA sequence data are often not suitable to test for IBD, and can be misleading about species' true dispersal potential. The observed failure of mtDNA to reliably detect IBD, in addition to being a single-locus marker, is likely a result of a selection-driven reduction in genetic diversity obscuring spatial genetic differentiation.

AB Root traits are often thought to be analogues of leaf traits along the plant economics spectrum. But evolutionary pressures have most likely shaped above-and belowground patterns differentially. Here, we aimed to identify the most important aboveground traits for explaining root traits without an a priori focus on known concepts.
   We measured morphological root traits in a glasshouse experiment on 141 common Central European grassland species. Using random forest algorithms, we built predictive models of six root traits from 97 aboveground morphological, ecological and life history traits.
   Root tissue density was best predicted by leaf dry matter content, whereas traits related to root fineness were best predicted by diaspore mass: the heavier the diaspore, the coarser the root system. Specific leaf area (SLA) was not an important predictor for any of the root traits.
   This study confirms the hypothesis that root traits are more than analogues of leaf traits within a plant economics spectrum. The results reveal a novel ecological pattern and highlight the power of root data to close important knowledge gaps in trait-based ecology.

AB Almost all climate change studies of plants and animals adopt an 'equilibrium assumption' that analyses of natural distributions provide reliable estimates of species climatic requirements. Yet commercial forestry trials around the world have shown that many tree species can grow successfully under climatic conditions somewhat different from those of their natural distributions. Under climate change it is reasonable to assume that a long-lived tree species, already well-established at particular sites, may be able to display some of the climatic adaptability shown in trials outside its natural distribution. The purpose of this paper is to outline how some species distribution modelling (SDM) and ecological niche modelling (ENM) studies have estimated species climatic requirements beyond those shown by conventional analyses of just their natural distributions, and to show how recent developments are facilitating these analyses. Some of the earliest SDM studies of trees demonstrated the desirability of assessing species climatic requirements using data from outside, as well as within, their natural distributions. In recent years, with the advent of large biodiversity databases and some revised SDM analysis methods, there has been a revival of interest in measuring species climatic requirements using data from beyond their realized niches. It is recommended that at least for tree species, natural distribution data, and where possible results from plantings beyond natural distributions, should be analysed in climate change studies. When this is not possible, some alternative methods of estimating species climatic requirements are identified and some of their advantages and disadvantages are considered.

AB For sessile organisms such as reef-building corals, differences in the degree of dispersion of individuals across a landscape may result from important differences in life-history strategies or may reflect patterns of habitat availability. Descriptions of spatial patterns can thus be useful not only for the identification of key biological and physical mechanisms structuring an ecosystem, but also by providing the data necessary to generate and test ecological theory. Here, we used an in situ imaging technique to create large-area photomosaics of 16 plots at Palmyra Atoll, central Pacific, each covering 100 m(2) of benthic habitat. We mapped the location of 44,008 coral colonies and identified each to the lowest taxonomic level possible. Using metrics of spatial dispersion, we tested for departures from spatial randomness. We also used targeted model fitting to explore candidate processes leading to differences in spatial patterns among taxa. Most taxa were clustered and the degree of clustering varied by taxon. A small number of taxa did not significantly depart from randomness and none revealed evidence of spatial uniformity. Importantly, taxa that readily fragment or tolerate stress through partial mortality were more clustered. With little exception, clustering patterns were consistent with models of fragmentation and dispersal limitation. In some taxa, dispersion was linearly related to abundance, suggesting density dependence of spatial patterning. The spatial patterns of stony corals are non-random and reflect fundamental life-history characteristics of the taxa, suggesting that the reef landscape may, in many cases, have important elements of spatial predictability.

AB Agricultural land conversion is resulting from ongoing complex interaction between the physical environment, policy settings and socio-economic factors. Case studies of the determinants of agricultural land conversion potentially contribute to the analysis of the main causes of land-use change. This can assist authorities and policy makers in understanding the relative importance of a wide range of factors on urban expansion and associated agricultural land-use change. This paper explores the determinants of agricultural land conversion to urban uses in the studied 25 European Union countries between 2000 and 2006. European-level as well as region-specific land-use changes are studied. The research is using the spatial data adapted from European Corine Land Cover maps of 2000 and 2006 and utilised other European sources regarding socio-economic, natural, geological, climate, and policy-related data. The differences in urbanisation processes observed in different regions in Europe emphasise the regional variations of urban conversion process of agricultural land use. This study identifies a combination of socio-economic drivers, policy-related factors, nature and location-based factors as key influences on agricultural land conversion processes in Europe. Specifically we found that the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) subsidies were influential in curbing urbanisation and reducing agricultural land consumption.

AB Community assembly processes is the primary focus of community ecology. Using phylogenetic-based and functional trait-based methods jointly to explore these processes along environmental gradients are useful ways to explain the change of assembly mechanisms under changing world. Our study combined these methods to test assembly processes in wide range gradients of elevation and other habitat environmental factors. We collected our data at 40 plots in Taibai Mountain, China, with more than 2,300m altitude difference in study area and then measured traits and environmental factors. Variance partitioning was used to distinguish the main environment factors leading to phylogeny and traits change among 40 plots. Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to colligate other environment factors. Community assembly patterns along environmental gradients based on phylogenetic and functional methods were studied for exploring assembly mechanisms. Phylogenetic signal was calculated for each community along environmental gradients in order to detect the variation of trait performance on phylogeny. Elevation showed a better explanatory power than other environment factors for phylogenetic and most traits' variance. Phylogenetic and several functional structure clustered at high elevation while some conserved traits overdispersed. Convergent tendency which might be caused by filtering or competition along elevation was detected based on functional traits. Leaf dry matter content (LDMC) and leaf nitrogen content along PCA 1 axis showed conflicting patterns comparing to patterns showed on elevation. LDMC exhibited the strongest phylogenetic signal. Only the phylogenetic signal of maximum plant height showed explicable change along environmental gradients. Synthesis. Elevation is the best environment factors for predicting phylogeny and traits change. Plant's phylogenetic and some functional structures show environmental filtering in alpine region while it shows different assembly processes in middle- and low-altitude region by different trait/phylogeny. The results highlight deterministic processes dominate community assembly in large-scale environmental gradients. Performance of phylogeny and traits along gradients may be independent with each other. The novel method for calculating functional structure which we used in this study and the focus of phylogenetic signal change along gradients may provide more useful ways to detect community assembly mechanisms.

AB How can we tell if the ecosystem services upon which we rely are at risk of being lost, potentially permanently? Ecosystem services underpin human well-being, but we lack a consistent approach for categorizing the extent to which they are threatened. We present an assessment framework for assessing the degree to which the adequate and sustainable provision of a given ecosystem service is threatened. Our framework combines information on the states and trends of both ecosystem service supply and demand, with reference to two critical thresholds: demand exceeding supply and ecosystem service 'extinction'. This framework can provide a basis for global, national, and regional assessments of threat to ecosystem services, and accompany existing assessments of threat to species and ecosystems.

AB Despite numerous research efforts over the last decades, integrating the concept of ecosystem services into land management decision-making continues to pose considerable challenges. Researchers have developed many different frameworks to operationalize the concept, but these are often specific to a certain issue and each has their own definitions and understandings of particular terms. Based on a comprehensive review of the current scientific debate, the EU FP7 project RECARE proposes an adapted framework for soil-related ecosystem services that is suited for practical application in the prevention and remediation of soil degradation across Europe. We have adapted existing frameworks by integrating components from soil science while attempting to introduce a consistent terminology that is understandable to a variety of stakeholders. RECARE aims to assess how soil threats and prevention and remediation measures affect ecosystem services. Changes in the natural capital's properties influence soil processes, which support the provision of ecosystem services. The benefits produced by these ecosystem services are explicitly or implicitly valued by individuals and society. This can influence decision- and policymaking at different scales, potentially leading to a societal response, such as improved land management The proposed ecosystem services framework will be applied by the RECARE project in a transdisciplinary process. It will assist in singling out the most beneficial land management measures and in identifying trade-offs and win-win situations resulting from and impacted by European policies. The framework thus reflects the specific contributions soils make to ecosystem services and helps reveal changes in ecosystem services caused by soil management and policies impacting on soil. At the same time, the framework is simple and robust enough for practical application in assessing soil threats and their management with stakeholders at various levels. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Community ecologists are active in describing species by their functional traits, quantifying the functional structure of plant and animal assemblages and inferring community assembly processes with null-model analyses of trait distribution and functional diversity indices. Intraspecific variation in traits and effects of spatial scale are potentially important in these analyses. Here, we introduce the R package cati (Community Assembly by Traits: Individuals and beyond) available on CRAN, for the analysis of community assembly with functional traits. cati builds on a recent approach to community assembly that explicitly incorporates individual differences in community assembly analyses and decomposes phenotypic variations across scales and organizational levels, based on three phenotypic variance ratios, termed the T-statistics. More generally, the cati package 1) calculates a variety of single-trait and multi-trait indices from interspecific and intraspecific trait measures; 2) it partitions functional trait variation among spatial and taxonomic levels; 3) it implements a palette of flexible null models for detecting non-random patterns of functional traits. These patterns can be used to draw inferences about hypotheses of community assembly such as environmental filtering and species interactions. The basic input for cati is a data frame in which columns are traits, rows are species or individuals, and entries are the measured trait values. The cati package can also incorporate a square distance matrix into analyses, which could include phylogenetic or genetic distances among individuals or species. Users select from a variety of functional trait metrics and analyze these relative to a null model that specifies trait distributions in a regional source pool.

AB The three cool-season perennial forage grasses cocksfoot/orchardgrass, Dactylis glomerata L., tall fescue, Festuca arundinacea Schreb. syn. Lolium arundinaceum (Schreb.) Darbysh., and phalaris/harding grass, Phalaris aquatica L., are of major economic and ecological importance in regions with summer-dry environments. This review considers the constraints that these species are likely to experience under current and predicted increase of droughts due to climate change scenarios in south-eastern Australia, the southern Great Plains of USA and the Western Mediterranean Basin. The review identifies research required to maximise the development and use of C3 cool-season grasses with enhanced resilience to drought while considering the concern of some regulators that these grasses may be potential weeds. The state of knowledge of factors influencing plant drought survival and therefore recovery after stress and long-term persistence is discussed in the light of adaptive strategies. The major research needs identified to enhance traits conferring drought survival include (1) increasing the depth and density of grass root systems to strengthen dehydration avoidance; (2) exploring the biochemical, molecular and hydraulic bases of dehydration tolerance and improving techniques to measure this trait; (3) breaking the trade-off between summer dormancy and forage yield potential and improving understanding of environmental, biochemical and genetic controls over summer dormancy; (4) identifying non-toxic endophyte strains compatible with summer-dormant cultivars of tall fescue to enhance drought survival; and (5) enhancing seed production capability of new cultivars as well as the development of agronomic management packages for promoting stable mixtures combining perennial grasses and legumes. The weed potential of newly introduced summer-dormant cultivars is concluded to be minor. The research directions proposed here should improve pasture grass resilience and forage crop sustainability in Mediterranean and temperate summer-dry environments under the future drier and warmer conditions associated with climate change.

AB How complex does a model need to be to provide useful predictions is a matter of continuous debate across environmental sciences. In the species distributions modelling literature, studies have demonstrated that more complex models tend to provide better fits. However, studies have also shown that predictive performance does not always increase with complexity. Testing of species distributions models is challenging because independent data for testing are often lacking, but a more general problem is that model complexity has never been formally described in such studies. Here, we systematically examine predictive performance of models against data and models of varying complexity. We introduce the concept of computational complexity, widely used in theoretical computer sciences, to quantify model complexity. In addition, complexity of species distributional data is characterized by their geometrical properties. Tests involved analysis of models' ability to predict virtual species distributions in the same region and the same time as used for training the models, and to project distributions in different times under climate change. Of the eight species distribution models analyzed five (Random Forest, boosted regression trees, generalized additive models, multivariate adaptive regression splines, MaxEnt) showed similar performance despite differences in computational complexity. The ability of models to forecast distributions under climate change was also not affected by model complexity. In contrast, geometrical characteristics of the data were related to model performance in several ways: complex datasets were consistently more difficult to model, and the complexity of the data was affected by the choice of predictors and the type of data analyzed. Given our definition of complexity, our study contradicts the widely held view that the complexity of species distributions models has significant effects in their predictive ability while findings support for previous observations that the properties of species distributions data and their relationship with the environment are strong predictors of model success.

AB Describing the evolutionary dynamics of now extinct populations is challenging, as their genetic composition before extinction is generally unknown. The Glanville fritillary butterfly has a large extant metapopulation in the Aland Islands in Finland, but declined to extinction in the nearby fragmented southwestern (SW) Finnish archipelago in the 20th century. We genotyped museum samples for 222 SNPs across the genome, including SNPs from candidate genes and neutral regions. SW Finnish populations had significantly reduced genetic diversity before extinction, and their allele frequencies gradually diverged from those in contemporary Aland populations over 80 y. We identified 15 outlier loci among candidate SNPs, mostly related to flight, in which allele frequencies have changed more than the neutral expectation. At outlier loci, allele frequencies in SW Finland shifted in the same direction as newly established populations deviated from old local populations in contemporary Aland. Moreover, outlier allele frequencies in SW Finland resemble those in fragmented landscapes as opposed to continuous landscapes in the Baltic region. These results indicate selection for genotypes associated with good colonization capacity in the highly fragmented landscape before the extinction of the populations. Evolutionary response to habitat fragmentation may have enhanced the viability of the populations, but it did not save the species from regional extinction in the face of severe habitat loss and fragmentation. These results highlight a potentially common situation in changing environments: evolutionary changes are not strong enough to fully compensate for the direct adverse effects of environmental change and thereby rescue populations from extinction.

AB AimCurrent interest in forecasting changes to species ranges has resulted in a multitude of approaches to species distribution models (SDMs). However, most approaches include only a small subset of the available information, and many ignore smaller-scale processes such as growth, fecundity and dispersal. Furthermore, different approaches often produce divergent predictions with no simple method to reconcile them. Here, we present a flexible framework for integrating models at multiple scales using hierarchical Bayesian methods.
   LocationEastern North America (as an example).
   MethodsOur framework builds a metamodel that is constrained by the results of multiple sub-models and provides probabilistic estimates of species presence. We applied our approach to a simulated dataset to demonstrate the integration of a correlative SDM with a theoretical model. In a second example, we built an integrated model combining the results of a physiological model with presence-absence data for sugar maple (Acer saccharum), an abundant tree native to eastern North America.
   ResultsFor both examples, the integrated models successfully included information from all data sources and substantially improved the characterization of uncertainty. For the second example, the integrated model outperformed the source models with respect to uncertainty when modelling the present range of the species. When projecting into the future, the model provided a consensus view of two models that differed substantially in their predictions. Uncertainty was reduced where the models agreed and was greater where they diverged, providing a more realistic view of the state of knowledge than either source model.
   Main conclusionsWe conclude by discussing the potential applications of our method and its accessibility to applied ecologists. In ideal cases, our framework can be easily implemented using off-the-shelf software. The framework has wide potential for use in species distribution modelling and can drive better integration of multi-source and multi-scale data into ecological decision-making.

AB Agroecosystems represent 38 % of global land use. Agroecosystems are located close to human settlements and are managed to produce food and fibers, traded in markets. Agroecosystems also produce other goods and services essential to human beings, such as climate regulation, flood mitigation, and landscape amenity. Economists and ecologists have developed the ecosystem services framework to foster the provision of these non-commercial services. Scientists can therefore help decision makers to develop sustainable ecosystems by studying ecosystem services. Here, we analyze the trade-offs of ecosystem services of farming systems. We discuss case studies of mixed perennial crops. The set of ecosystem services provided by these agroecosystems depends on their composition, structure, and management. Complex rule-based management will be required if winegrowers are to maintain an adequate set of ecosystem services across contrasting climatic years. Innovations including cover crops in banana systems can fulfill most of the objective set but will rely on increased farm labor. We then discuss the advantages, challenges, and opportunities to include the description of relations between ecosystem services in cropping system design. We propose to extend the yield gap analysis to ecosystem services, as a service gap analysis. This extension faces methodological questions about the potential provision of a service in a region. We conclude on the challenges that need to be faced if we want to use ecosystem services trade-offs to improve the contribution of agricultural systems to human well-being.

AB Fires are a recurrent disturbance in Semiarid Chaco mountains of central Argentina. The interaction of multiple factors generates variable patterns of fire occurrence in space and time. Understanding the dominant fire drivers at different spatial scales is a fundamental goal to minimize the negative impacts of fires. Our aim was to identify the biophysical and human drivers of fires in the Semiarid Chaco mountains of Central Argentina and their individual effects on fire activity, in order to determine the thresholds and/or ranges of the drivers at which fire occurrence is favored or disfavored. We used fire frequency as the response variable and a set of 28 potential predictor variables, which included climatic, human, topographic, biological and hydrological factors. Data were analyzed using Boosted Regression Trees, using data from near 10,500 sampling points. Our model identified the fire drivers accurately (75.6% of deviance explained). Although humans are responsible for most ignitions, climatic variables, such as annual precipitation, annual potential evapotranspiration and temperature seasonality were the most important determiners of fire frequency, followed by human (population density and distance to waste disposals) and biological (NDVI) predictors. In general, fire activity was higher at intermediate levels of precipitation and primary productivity and in the proximity of urban solid waste disposals. Fires were also more prone to occur in areas with greater variability in temperature and productivity. Boosted Regression Trees proved to be a useful and accurate tool to determine fire controls and the ranges at which drivers favor fire activity. Our approach provides a valuable insight into the ecology of fires in our study area and in other landscapes with similar characteristics, and the results will be helpful to develop management policies and predict changes in fire activity in response to different climate changes and development scenarios.

AB Context Urban community gardens are globally prevalent urban agricultural areas and have the potential to fulfill human needs in impoverished neighborhoods, such as food security and access to open space. Despite these benefits, little research has been conducted evaluating environmental and socioeconomic factors influencing community garden plant biodiversity and ecosystem services (ES).
   Objective Our study investigated the drivers of managed plant richness, abundance, and ES production in community gardens across Los Angeles County, CA from 2010 to 2012 at regional, garden, and plot scales.
   Methods Fourteen community gardens were visited in the summers of 2010-2012 for comprehensive species surveys across regional, garden, and plot scales. We compared biodiversity to household income, plot size, and gardener ethnicity.
   Results In total, 707 managed plant species were recorded in summer surveys over a 3-year period. Ornamental plant richness increased with neighborhood income, while edible and medicinal richness increased with size of garden plots. Gardener ethnicity also influenced the composition of managed species, especially edible species.
   Conclusions We explain these patterns through a hierarchy of needs framework; gardeners preferentially plant species progressively less connected to human need. Ornamental plant increases in high-income regions may be explained by their requirement for financial investment and maintenance time. Cultural and provisioning ES are important for immigrant populations, resulting in ethnically distinct crop assemblages. Finally, distinct species-area relationships imply high demand for food abundance and biodiversity. Our quantitative results indicate that community gardens contribute to a biologically diverse urban ecosystem and provide valued ecosystem services in food insecure regions.
