AB BEAGLE is a high-performance likelihood-calculation library for phylogenetic inference. The BEAGLE library defines a simple, but flexible, application programming interface (API), and includes a collection of efficient implementations for calculation under a variety of evolutionary models on different hardware devices. The library has been integrated into recent versions of popular phylogenetics software packages including BEAST and MrBayes and has been widely used across a diverse range of evolutionary studies. Here, we present BEAGLE 3 with new parallel implementations, increased performance for challenging data sets, improved scalability, and better usability. We have added new OpenCL and central processing unit-threaded implementations to the library, allowing the effective utilization of a wider range of modern hardware. Further, we have extended the API and library to support concurrent computation of independent partial likelihood arrays, for increased performance of nucleotide-model analyses with greater flexibility of data partitioning. For better scalability and usability, we have improved how phylogenetic software packages use BEAGLE in multi-GPU (graphics processing unit) and cluster environments, and introduced an automated method to select the fastest device given the data set, evolutionary model, and hardware. For application developers who wish to integrate the library, we also have developed an online tutorial. To evaluate the effect of the improvements, we ran a variety of benchmarks on state-of-the-art hardware. For a partitioned exemplar analysis, we observe run-time performance improvements as high as 5.9-fold over our previous GPU implementation. BEAGLE 3 is free, open-source software licensed under the Lesser GPL and available at https://beagle-dev.github.io.

AB Species Distribution Modelling (SDM) techniques were originally developed in the mid-1980s. In this century they are gaining increasing attention in the literature and in practical use as a powerful tool to support forest management strategies especially under climate change. In this review paper we consider species occurrence datasets, climatic and soil predictor variables, modelling algorithms, evaluation methods and widely used software for SDM studies. We describe several important and freely available sources for species occurrence and interpolated climatic data. We outline the use of both presence-only and presence/absence modelling algorithms including distance-based algorithms, machine learning algorithms and regression-based models. We conclude that SDM techniques provide a valuable asset for forest managers. However, it is essential to consider uncertainties behind the use of future climate change scenarios.

AB The global trade of species promotes diverse human activities but also facilitates the introduction of potentially invasive species into new environments. As species ignore national boundaries, unilateral national decisions concerning species trade set the stage for transnational species invasion with significant conservation, economic and political consequences. The need for a coordinated approach to species importation policies is demonstrated by the introduction of two bumblebee species into Chile for crop pollination, despite Argentina banning commercial importation of alien bumblebees based on expert opinion. The large garden bumblebee, Bombus ruderatus, was first introduced in 1982, and the buff-tailed bumblebee, Bombus terrestris, has been continually introduced since 1997 as part of the burgeoning bumblebee trade. Both species have subsequently invaded southern South America. Today, the consequences of the growth of the bumblebee trade for agricultural pollination ranks among the top 15 emerging environmental issues likely to affect global diversity. Documented impacts of these invasions include the severe decline and local extinctions of the sole native Patagonian bumblebee, Bombus dahlbomii, pathogen transmission, flower damage and nectar robbing of native and cultivated plants. Policy implications. The South American bumblebee invasions portrayed here should alert governments to the unintended consequences of the booming international bee trade. More broadly, this case demonstrates that one country's importation decisions can have policy implications for its neighbours without consultation. Regrettably, coordinated international measures to prevent species invasions are seldom considered in South America or elsewhere, despite existing legal frameworks. The bumblebee case and others provide stark evidence of the pressing need for coordinated specific and general international policies concerning global species trade and their implementation.

AB Studies documenting the effects of land-derived suspended particulate matter (SPM, i.e., particulate organic matter and mineral sediment) on marine ecosystems are typically disconnected from terrestrial studies that determine their origin, transport and fate. This study reviews sources, transport, transformations, fate and effects of SPM along the 'ridge-to-reef' continuum. We show that some of the SPM can be transported over long distances and transformed into large and easily resuspendible organic-rich sediment flocs. These flocs may lead to prolonged reductions in water clarity, impacting upon coral reef, seagrass and fish communities. Using the Great Barrier Reef (NE Australia) as a case study, we identify the latest research tools to determine thresholds of SPM exposure, allowing for an improved appreciation of marine risk. These tools are used to determine ecologically relevant end-of-basin load targets and reliable marine water quality guidelines, thereby enabling enhanced prioritisation and management of SPM export from ridge-to-reef.

AB Designing landscapes that can meet human needs, while maintaining functioning ecosystems, it essential for long-term sustainability. To achieve this goal, we must better understand the trade-offs and thresholds in the provision of ecosystem services and economic returns. To this end, we integrate spatially explicit economic and biophysical models to jointly optimize agricultural profit (sugarcane production and cattle ranching), biodiversity (bird and mammal species), and freshwater quality (nitrogen, phosphorus, and sediment retention) in the Brazilian Cerrado. We generate efficiency frontiers to evaluate the economic and environmental trade-offs and map efficient combinations of agricultural land and natural habitat under varying service importance. To assess the potential impact of the Brazilian Forest Code (FC), a federal policy that aims to promote biodiversity and ecosystem services on private lands, we compare the frontiers with optimizations that mimic the habitat requirements in the region. We find significant opportunities to improve both economic and environmental outcomes relative to the current landscape. Substantial trade-offs between biodiversity and water quality exist when land use planning targets a single service, but these trade-offs can be minimized through multi-objective planning. We also detect non-linear profit-ecosystem services relationships that result in land use thresholds that coincide with the FC requirements. Further, we demonstrate that landscape-level planning can greatly improve the performance of the FC relative to traditional farm-level planning. These findings suggest that through joint planning for economic and environmental goals at a landscape-scale, Brazil's,agricultural sector can expand production and meet regulatory requirements, while maintaining biodiversity and ecosystem service provision.

AB Understanding physiological acclimation of photosynthesis and respiration is important in elucidating the metabolic performance of trees in a changing climate. Does physiological acclimation to climate warming mirror acclimation to seasonal temperature changes? We grew Eucalyptus tereticornis trees in the field for 14months inside 9-m tall whole-tree chambers tracking ambient air temperature (T-air) or ambient T-air+3 degrees C (i.e. warmed'). We measured light- and CO2-saturated net photosynthesis (A(max)) and night-time dark respiration (R) each month at 25 degrees C to quantify acclimation. Tree growth was measured, and leaf nitrogen (N) and total nonstructural carbohydrate (TNC) concentrations were determined to investigate mechanisms of acclimation. Warming reduced A(max) and R measured at 25 degrees C compared to ambient-grown trees. Both traits also declined as mean daily T-air increased, and did so in a similar way across temperature treatments. A(max) and R (at 25 degrees C) both increased as TNC concentrations increased seasonally; these relationships appeared to arise from source-sink imbalances, suggesting potential substrate regulation of thermal acclimation. We found that photosynthesis and respiration each acclimated equivalently to experimental warming and seasonal temperature change of a similar magnitude, reflecting a common, nearly homeostatic constraint on leaf carbon exchange that will be important in governing tree responses to climate warming.

AB Hydroelectricity is increasingly used worldwide as a source of renewable energy, and many mountain ranges have dozens or hundreds of hydropower plants, with many more being under construction or planned. Although the ecological impacts of large dams are relatively well known, the effects of small hydropower plants and their weirs have been much less investigated. We studied the effects of water diversion of small hydropower plants on fish assemblages in the upper Ter river basin (Catalonia, NE Spain), which has headwater reaches with good water quality and no large dams but many of such plants. We studied fish populations and habitat features on control and impacted reaches for water diversion of 16 hydropower plants. In the impacted reaches, there was a significantly lower presence of refuges for fish, poorer habitat quality, more pools and less riffles and macrophytes, and shallower water levels. We also observed higher fish abundance, larger mean fish size and better fish condition in the control than in impacted reaches, although the results were species-specific. Accordingly, species composition was also affected, with lower relative abundance of brown trout (Salmo trutta) and Pyrenean minnow (Phoxinus bigerri) in the impacted reaches and higher presence of stone loach (Barbatula quignardi) and Mediterranean barbel (Barbus meridionalis). Our study highlights the effects of water diversion of small hydropower plants from the individual to the population and community levels but probably underestimates them, urging for further assessment and mitigation of these ecological impacts.

AB Background and Aims Leaf gas exchange is influenced by stomatal size, density, distribution between the leaf adaxial and abaxial sides, as well as by pore dimensions. This study aims to quantify which of these traits mainly underlie genetic differences in operating stomatal conductance (g(s)) and addresses possible links between anatomical traits and regulation of pore width.
   Methods Stomatal responsiveness to desiccation, g(s)-related anatomical traits of each leaf side and estimated g(s) (based on these traits) were determined for 54 introgression lines (ILs) generated by introgressing segments of Solanum pennelli into the S. lycopersicum 'M82'. A quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis for stomatal traits was also performed.
   Key Results A wide genetic variation in stomatal responsiveness to desiccation was observed, a large part of which was explained by stomatal length. Operating g(s) ranged over a factor of five between ILs. The pore area per stomatal area varied 8-fold among ILs (2-16 %), and was the main determinant of differences in operating g(s) between ILs. Operating g(s) was primarily positioned on the abaxial surface (60-83 %), due to higher abaxial stomatal density and, secondarily, to larger abaxial pore area. An analysis revealed 64 QTLs for stomatal traits in the ILs, most of which were in the direction of S. pennellii.
   Conclusions The data indicate that operating and maximum g(s) of non-stressed leaves maintained under stable conditions deviate considerably (by 45-91 %), because stomatal size inadequately reflects operating pore area (R-2 = 0.46). Furthermore, it was found that variation between ILs in both stomatal sensitivity to desiccation and operating g(s) is associated with features of individual stoma. In contrast, genotypic variation in g(s) partitioning depends on the distribution of stomata between the leaf adaxial and abaxial epidermis.

AB This study investigated the possible effects of tree species diversity and identity on the soil microbial community in a species-rich temperate broad-leaved forest. For the first time, we separated the effects of tree identity and tree species diversity on the link between above and belowground communities in a near-natural forest. We established 100 tree clusters consisting of each three tree individuals represented by beech (Fagus sylvatica L), ash (Fraxinus excelsior L.), hornbeam (Carpinus betulus L), maple (Acer pseudoplatanus L.), or lime (Tilia spec.) at two different sites in the Hainich National Park (Thuringia, Germany). The tree clusters included one, two or three species forming a diversity gradient. We investigated the microbial community structure, using phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) profiles, in mineral soil samples (0-10 cm) collected in the centre of each cluster.
   The lowest total PLFA amounts were found in the pure beech clusters (79.0 +/- 23.5 nmol g(-1) soil dw), the highest PLFA amounts existed in the pure ash clusters (287.3 +/- 211.3 nmol g(-1) soil dw). Using principle components analyses (PCA) and redundancy analyses (RDA), we found only for the variables 'relative proportion of beech trees' and 'living lime fine root tips associated with ectomycorrhiza' a significant effect on the PLFA composition. The microbial community structure was mainly determined by abiotic environmental parameters such as soil pH or clay content. The different species richness levels in the clusters did not significantly differ in their total PLFA amounts and their PLFA composition. We observed a tendency that the PLFA profiles of the microbial communities in more tree species-rich clusters were less influenced by individual PLFAs (more homogenous) than those from species-poor clusters.
   We concluded that tree species identity and site conditions were more important factors determining the soil microbial community structure than tree species diversity per se. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Transport infrastructure has a wide array of effects on terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, and road and railway networks are increasingly being associated with a loss of biodiversity worldwide. Environmental Impact Assessment (ETA) and Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) are two legal frameworks that concern physical planning, with the potential to identify, predict, mitigate and/or compensate transport infrastructure effects with negative impacts on biodiversity. The aim of this study was to review the treatment of ecological impacts in environmental assessment of transport infrastructure plans and projects. A literature review on the topic of EIA, SEA, biodiversity and transport infrastructure was conducted, and 17 problem categories on the treatment of biodiversity were formulated by means of a content analysis. A review of environmental impact statements and environmental reports (EIS/ER) produced between 2005 and 2013 in Sweden and the UK was then conducted using the list of problems as a checklist The results show that the treatment of ecological impacts has improved substantially over the years, but that some impacts remain problematic; the treatment of fragmentation, the absence of quantitative analysis and that the impact assessment study area was in general delimited without consideration for the scales of ecological processes. Actions to improve the treatment of ecological impacts could include improved guidelines for spatial and temporal delimitation, and the establishment of a quantitative framework including tools, methods and threshold values. Additionally, capacity building and further method development of EIA and SEA friendly spatial ecological models can aid in clarifying the costs as well as the benefits in development/biodiversity tradeoffs.

AB By the end of this century, mean annual temperatures in the Northeastern United States are expected to warm by 3-5 degrees C, which will have significant impacts on the structure and function of temperate forests in this region. To improve understanding of these impacts, we exploited two recent climate anomalies to explore how the springtime phenology of Northeastern temperate deciduous forests will respond to future climate warming. Specifically, springtime temperatures in 2010 and 2012 were the warmest on record in the Northeastern United States, with temperatures that were roughly equivalent to the lower end of warming scenarios that are projected for this region decades from now. Climate conditions in these two years therefore provide a unique empirical basis, that complements model-based studies, for improving understanding of how northeastern temperate forest phenology will change in the future. To perform our investigation, we analyzed near surface air temperatures from the United States Historical Climatology Network, time series of satellite-derived vegetation indices from NASA's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, and in situ phenological observations. Our study region encompassed the northern third of the eastern temperate forest ecoregion, extending from Pennsylvania to Canada. Springtime temperatures in 2010 and 2012 were nearly 3 degrees C warmer than long-term average temperatures from 1971-2000 over the region, leading to median anomalies of more than 100 growing degree days. In response, satellite and ground observations show that leaf emergence occurred up to two weeks earlier than normal, but with significant sensitivity to the specific timing of thermal forcing. These results are important for two reasons. First, they provide an empirical demonstration of the sensitivity of springtime phenology in northeastern temperate forests to future climate change that supports and complements model-based predictions. Second, our results show that subtle differences in the character of thermal forcing can substantially alter the timing of leaf emergence and canopy development. By explicitly comparing and contrasting the timing of thermal forcing and leaf phenology in 2010 and 2012, we show that even though temperatures were warmer in 2012 than in 2010, the nature and timing of thermal forcing in 2010 lead to leaf emergence that was almost a week earlier than 2012.

AB The ecosystem services approach has been proven successful to measure the contributions of nature and greenery to human well-being. Ecosystems have an effect on quality of life, but landscapes also, as a broader concept, may contribute to people's well-being. The concept of landscape services, compared to ecosystem services, involves the social dimension of landscape and the spatial pattern resulting from both natural and human processes in the provision of benefits for human-well being. Our aim is to develop a classification for landscape services. The proposed typology of services is built on the Common International Classification of Ecosystem Services (CICES) and on a critical review of existing literature on human well-being dimensions, existing ecosystem service classifications, and landscape perception. Three themes of landscape services are defined, each divided into several groups: provisioning, regulation and maintenance, cultural and social life fulfillment, with the latter focusing on health, enjoyment, and personal and social fulfillment. A special emphasis is made on cultural services, which are especially important when applied to landscape and which have received less attention.

AB This paper discusses some of the challenges and opportunities that can arise when implementing ecosystem-based management (EBM) in tropical nations. EBM creates a new series of challenges, problems, and opportunities that must be considered in light of existing governance and management frameworks in a local context. The paper presents five case studies from different parts of the tropical world, including Oceania, insular and continental Southeast Asia, East Africa, and the Caribbean, which illustrate that the implementation of EBM in watershed and marine ecosystems offers a new series of challenges and opportunities for its inclusion with existing forms of environmental governance and management. The paper suggests that EBM is best thought of as an expansion of customary management (CM) and integrated coastal management (ICM), rather than a paradigm shift, and that it has certain benefits that are worth integrating into existing systems when possible. The paper concludes that the cultural and institutional context of CM as well as the experience, technical skills, and legal basis that serve ICM programs are logical platforms from which to build EBM programs. Some guidelines for creating hybrid management regimes are suggested. In sum, declining marine species and ecosystems require urgent action, necessitating utilization of existing paradigms such as ICM and CM as a foundation for building EBM. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB 1. The drying of stream channels resulting from flow interruption is expected to increase as a consequence of climate change. Implications for aquatic organisms and processes are profound. We assessed whether riparian diversity can partially buffer against consequences of drying on fungal decomposers and leaf litter decomposition, an important ecosystem process.
   2. Our central hypothesis was that during dry periods recalcitrant leaf litter with high water-holding capacity would extend the window of opportunity for microbial activity in less recalcitrant litter when both litter types are mixed, and that this would lead to a positive litter diversity effect on decomposition. To test for such interactive effects, we conducted a diversity experiment in a Mediterranean stream, in which alder and oak litter, and a mixture of both, was subjected to various drying regimes differing in intensity and timing.
   3. Drying regime affected both fungal decomposers and the decomposition rate of alder litter. Effects were observed both immediately and 3 weeks after stream flow resumed. Small differences in the timing of the dry period influenced both decomposition rate and measures of fungal performance (i.e. biomass and sporulation activity). Litter mixing, in contrast, had no effect on either decomposition or fungal decomposers, although mixing increased moisture retention in alder litter as required for the mechanism hypothesized to lead to a diversity effect.
   4. Given the contrasting traits of the litter types used in the experiment, our results imply that riparian tree diversity is unlikely to buffer against increased frequencies of stream flow disruption expected in the face of climate change. It appears, however, that the precise timing of dry periods and high-flow events will strongly influence the extent to which stream food webs can exploit the resources supplied by riparian vegetation in the form of leaf litter.

AB Many biological invasions do not occur as a gradual expansion along a continuous front, but result from the expansion of satellite populations that become established at 'invasion hubs'. Although theoretical studies indicate that targeting control efforts at invasion hubs can effectively contain the spread of invasions, few studies have demonstrated this in practice. In arid landscapes worldwide, humans have increased the availability of surface water by creating artificial water points (AWPs) such as troughs and dams for livestock. By experimentally excluding invasive cane toads (Bufo marinus) from AWP, we show that AWP provide a resource subsidy for non-arid-adapted toads and serve as dry season refuges and thus invasion hubs for cane toads in arid Australia. Using data on the distribution of permanent water in arid Australia and the dispersal potential of toads, we predict that systematically excluding toads from AWP would reduce the area of arid Australia across which toads are predicted to disperse and colonize under average climatic conditions by 38 per cent from 2 242 000 to 1 385 000 km(2). Our study shows how human modification of hydrological regimes can create a network of invasion hubs that facilitates a biological invasion, and confirms that targeted control at invasion hubs can reduce landscape connectivity to contain the spread of an invasive vertebrate.

AB In evolutionary plant breeding, crop populations with a high level of genetic diversity are subjected to the forces of natural selection. In a cycle of sowing and re-sowing seed from the plant population year after year, those plants favored under prevailing growing conditions are expected to contribute more seed to the next generation than plants with lower fitness. Thus, evolving crop populations have the capability of adapting to the conditions under which they are grown. Here we review the current state of research in evolutionary plant breeding and concentrate on the ability of evolving plant populations to deal with stressful, variable, and unpredictable environments. This resilience of evolving plant populations is seen as a major advantage under the predicted threats faced by agriculture such as global climate change. We have conducted an analysis of the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats of this breeding approach and suggest how its concept can be broadened and expanded. Given the current legal restrictions for realizing the potential of evolutionary plant breeding, we call for a change in legislation to allow evolving crop populations to enter agricultural practice on a larger scale.

   Fire affects the structure and dynamics of ecosystems world-wide, over long time periods (decades and centuries) and at large spatial scales (landscapes and regions). A pressing challenge for ecologists is to develop models that explain and predict faunal responses to fire at broad temporal and spatial scales. We used a 105-year post-fire chronosequence to investigate small mammal responses to fire across an extensive area of 'tree mallee' (i.e. vegetation characterized by small multi-stemmed eucalypts).
   Location
   The Murray Mallee region (104,000 km superset of) of semi-arid Australia.
   Methods
   First, we surveyed small mammals at 260 sites and explored the fire responses of four species using nonlinear regression models. Second, we assessed the predictive accuracy of models using cross-validation and by testing with independent data. Third, we examined our results in relation to an influential model of animal succession, the habitat accommodation model.
   Results
   Two of four study species showed a clear response to fire history. The distribution of the Mallee Ningaui Ningaui yvonneae, a carnivorous marsupial, was strongly associated with mature vegetation characterized by its cover of hummock grass. The occurrence of breeding females was predicted to increase up to 40-105 years post-fire, highlighting the extensive time periods over which small mammal populations may be affected by fire. Evaluation of models for N. yvonneae demonstrated that accurate predictions of species occurrence can be made from fire history and vegetation data, across large geographical areas. The introduced House Mouse Mus domesticus was the only species positively associated with recently burnt vegetation.
   Main conclusions
   Understanding the impact of fire over long time periods will benefit ecological and conservation management. In this example, tracts of long-unburnt mallee vegetation were identified as important habitat for a fire-sensitive native mammal. Small mammal responses to fire can be predicted accurately at broad spatial scales; however, a conceptual model of post-fire change in community structure developed in temperate Australia is not, on its own, sufficient for small mammals in semi-arid systems.

AB Our knowledge about genetic mating systems and the underlying causes for and consequences of variation in reproductive success has substantially improved in recent years. When linked to longitudinal population studies, cross-generational pedigrees across wild populations can help answer a wide suite of questions in ecology and evolutionary biology. We used microsatellite markers and exhaustive sampling of two successive adult generations to obtain population-wide estimates of individual reproductive output of males and females in a natural population of the Neotropical frog Allobates femoralis (Aromobatidae), a pan-Amazonian species that features prolonged iteroparous breeding, male territoriality and male parental care. Parentage analysis revealed a polygynandrous mating system in which high proportions of males (35.5%) and females (56.0%) produced progeny that survived until adulthood. Despite contrasting reproductive strategies, successfully reproducing males and females had similar numbers of mating partners that sired the adult progeny (both sexes: median 2; range 1-6); the numbers of their offspring that reached adulthood were also similar (both sexes: median 2; range 1-8). Measures of reproductive skew indicate selection on males only for their opportunity to breed. Reproductive success was significantly higher in territorial than in nonterritorial males, but unrelated to territory size in males or to body size in both sexes. We hypothesize that female polyandry in this species has evolved because of enhanced offspring survival when paternal care is allocated to multiple partners.

AB A major challenge in ecology is to understand the impact of increased environmental variability on populations and ecosystems. To maximize their fitness in a variable environment, life history theory states that individuals should favor a bet-hedging strategy, involving a reduction of annual breeding performance and an increase in adult survival so that reproduction can be attempted over more years. As a result, evolution toward longer life span is expected to reduce the deleterious effects of extra variability on population growth, and consequently on the trait contributing the most to it (e. g., adult survival in long-lived species). To investigate this, we compared the life histories of two Black-browed Albatross (Thalassarche melanophrys) populations breeding at South Georgia (Atlantic Ocean) and Kerguelen (Indian Ocean), the former in an environment nearly three times more variable climatically (e. g., in sea surface temperature) than the latter. As predicted, individuals from South Georgia (in the more variable environment) showed significantly higher annual adult survival (0.959, SE = 0.003) but lower annual reproductive success (0.285 chick per pair, SE = 0.039) than birds from Kerguelen (survival = 0.925, SE = 0.004; breeding success = 0.694, SE = 0.027). In both populations, climatic conditions affected the breeding success and the survival of inexperienced breeders, whereas the survival of experienced breeders was unaffected. The strength of the climatic impact on survival of inexperienced breeders was very similar between the two populations, but the effect on breeding success was positively related to environmental variability. These results provide rare and compelling evidence to support bet-hedging underlying changes in life history traits as an adaptive response to environmental variability.

AB Traian Orghidan's seminal paper on the hyporheic zone was published in German in Archiv fur Hydrobiologie 50 years ago. To celebrate this anniversary, it has now been translated into English and republished in Fundamental and Applied Limnology, the successor to Archiv fur Hydrobiologie, as part of this special issue on hyporheic zone ecology. Here we examine the development and current state of knowledge of four aspects of hyporheic zone ecology first articulated by Orghidan. First, we consider the ecotonal nature of the hyporheic zone (HZ) and its relationship to the wider stream ecosystem; second, surface water and groundwater habitat interconnectivity within the hyporheic zone; third, the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of the HZ and how this may influence its function as a refugium for taxa during disturbances; and lastly interactions between hyporheic invertebrates and pore water volume, bacterial densities and particulate organic carbon. We outline the characteristics of the hyporheic zone that may determine how effective it will be as a refugium for benthic taxa during disturbances and consider the biological traits of benthic species most able to utilise the HZ as a refugium. Finally, we examine an important avenue of research that has developed since Orghidans paper reflecting significant scientific and technological advances; the role of the hyporheic zone in stream nutrient dynamics. We conclude by considering some areas where further research is likely to advance our understanding of the hyporheic zone and its interaction with the wider stream ecosystem

AB P>1. Population assessment in changing environments is challenging because factors governing abundance may also affect detectability and thus bias observed counts. We describe a hierarchical modelling framework for estimating abundance corrected for detectability in metapopulation designs, where observations of 'individuals' (e.g. territories) are replicated in space and time. We consider two classes of models; first, we regard the data as independent binomial counts and model abundance and detectability based on a product-binomial likelihood. Secondly, we use the more complex detection-non-detection data for each territory to form encounter history frequencies, and analyse the resulting multinomial/Poisson hierarchical model. Importantly, we extend both models to directly estimate population trends over multiple years. Our models correct for any time trends in detectability when assessing population trends in abundance.
   2. We illustrate both models for a farmland and a woodland bird species, skylark Alauda arvensis and willow tit Parus montanus, by applying them to Swiss BBS data, where 268 1 km2 quadrats were surveyed two to three times during 1999-2003. We fit binomial and multinomial mixture models where log(abundance) depended on year, elevation, forest cover and transect route length, and logit(detection) on year, season and search effort.
   3. Parameter estimates were very similar between models with confidence intervals overlapping for most parameters. Trend estimates were similar for skylark (-0.074 +/- 0.041 vs. -0.047 +/- 0.019) and willow tit (0.044 +/- 0.046 vs. 0.047 +/- 0.018). As expected, the multinomial model gave more precise estimates, but also yielded lower abundance estimates for the skylark. This may be due to effects of territory misclassification (lumping error), which do not affect the binomial model.
   4. Both models appear useful for estimating abundance and population trends free from distortions by detectability in metapopulation designs with temporally replicated observations. The ability to obtain estimates of abundance and population trends that are unbiased with respect to any time trends in detectability ought to be a strong motivation for the collection of replicate observation data.

AB Recent recognition of widespread polyandry in insects has generated considerable interest in understanding why females mate multiple times and in identifying factors that affect mating rate and inhibit female remating. However, little attention has been paid to understanding the question from both a female and male perspective, particularly with respect to factors that may simultaneously influence female remating rates. Here, we report on a study aimed at ascertaining the possible interactive effects that male and female size and diet, and female access to a host could have on mating latency, probability, and duration and female refractory period using two tropical fruit fly species with contrasting life histories. Of all factors tested, adult diet played the most significant role. Both Anastrepha ludens and Anastrepha obliqua males which had constant access to protein and sucrose mated more often, had shorter copulations and induced longer refractory periods in females than males fed a low quality diet (sucrose offered every third day). Female size and the interaction with male diet determined how quickly female A. ludens mated for the first time. Smaller females mated sooner with low quality fed males than with high quality fed males while there was no difference for large females, suggesting that male choice may be at play if high quality fed males discriminate against smaller females. Copulation duration also depended on both male and female nutritional condition, and the interaction between male diet and female size and diet. Large and high quality fed females had shorter copulations regardless of male condition. Importantly, for A. ludens, female refractory period depended on male size and the nutritional condition of both males and females, which could indicate that for this species, female receptivity does not depend only on the condition of the male ejaculate. For A. obliqua refractory period was associated with the interaction between male size and diet and male diet and host presence. We discuss our results in terms of male ability to inhibit female remating and the relative contribution of female condition to this behavior. We also address the importance of studying effects simultaneously on species with contrasting life histories. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

It is shown that good explanatory models can be developed and further, allowing for interactions between model variables significantly improves the model fits compared with non-interacting models. Methods are used to determine which variables exert most influence over predicted concentrations and to explore the NO(X) dependency for each. Model predictions are used to estimate aircraft take-off contributions to total concentrations of NO(X) and determine how these predictions are affected by annual variations in meteorological conditions and runway use patterns. Furthermore, the results relating to the aircraft contributions to total NO(X) concentration are compared with those from a more detailed independent field campaign. Finally, we find empirical evidence that plumes from larger aircraft disperse more rapidly from the point of release compared with smaller aircraft. The reasons for this behaviour and the implications are discussed. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Forest floor chemistry and microbial communities can be influenced by forest land management, such as harvesting and prescribed burning. Here, we used phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) and multiple carbon-source substrate-induced respiration (MSIR) analyses to characterize microbial communities of deciduous, mixedwood and coniferous boreal forest floors with different silvicultural treatments. The sites were stem-only harvested with 10% retention, and silvicultural treatments consisting of slash being evenly distributed on the site and then burned, or not burned. The burned sites exhibited lower microbial biomass and greater NO3- concentrations than the unburned sites. However, burning appeared to have no effect on forest floor microbial community structure or function. On the other hand, during drier months (August sampling), the composition of forest floor microbial communities appeared to be strongly influenced by topographic position rather than stand related differences. Harvested sites located at higher elevations had similar microbial communities, regardless of the overstory composition, while coniferous and mixedwood sites located at lower elevations had similarly structured microbial communities that were distinct from deciduous sites. Differences in microclimatic conditions of the forest floor between higher elevation sites and lower elevations sites may select for some microbial groups over others. Indicator analysis found a strong association of a fungal PLFA biomarker (20:1 omega 9c), with sites at higher elevation, while a biomarker for actinomycetes (10Me19:0) was strongly associated with deciduous sites at lower elevation. Structural differences in microbial communities observed between sites at higher and lower elevations appear to be linked to seasonal patterns in moisture, as previous studies in this region found no apparent effect of elevation during times of higher monthly precipitation.

AB There is a growing appreciation of impacts of late-Quaternary climate fluctuations on spatial patterns of species and genetic diversity. A major challenge is to understand how and why species respond individualistically to a common history of climate-induced habitat fluctuation. Here, we combine modelling of palaeo-distributions and mitochondrial-DNA phylogeographies to compare spatial patterns of population persistence and isolation across three species of rainforest skinks (Saproscincus spp.) with varying climatic preferences. Using Akaike Information Criterion model-averaged projections, all three species are predicted to have maintained one or more small populations in the northern Wet Tropics, multiple or larger populations in the central region, and few if any in the south. For the high-elevation species, Saproscincus czechurai, the warm-wet climate of the mid Holocene was most restrictive, whereas for the generalist S. basiliscus and lower-elevation S. tetradactyla, the cool-dry last glacial maximum was most restrictive. As expected, S. czechurai was the most genetically structured species, although relative to modelled distributions, S. basiliscus had surprisingly deep phylogeographical structure among southern rainforest isolates, implying long-term isolation and persistence. For both S. basiliscus and S. tetradactyla, there was high genetic diversity and complex phylogeographical patterns in the central Wet Tropics, reflecting persistence of large, structured populations. A previously identified vicariant barrier separating northern and central regions is supported, and results from these species also emphasize a historical persistence of populations south of another biogeographical break, the Tully Gorge. Overall, the results support the contention that in a topographically heterogeneous landscape, species with broader climatic niches may maintain higher and more structured genetic diversity due to persistence through varying climates.

AB Extensive distributional data bases are key tools in ecological research, and good-quality data are required to provide reliable conservation strategies and an understanding of biodiversity patterns and processes. Although the evaluation of data bases requires the incorporation of estimates of sampling effort and bias, no studies have focused on these aspects for freshwater biodiversity data. We used here a comprehensive data base of water beetles from the Iberian Peninsula and the Balearic Islands, and examine whether these data provide an unbiased, reliable picture of their diversity and distribution in the study area. Based on theoretical estimates using the Clench function on the accumulated number of records as a surrogate of sampling effort, about a quarter of the Iberian and Balearic 50 x 50 km Universal Transverse Mercator grid cells can be considered well prospected, with more than 70% of the theoretical species richness actually recorded. These well-surveyed cells are not evenly distributed across biogeographical and physicoclimatic subregions, reflecting some geographical bias in the distribution of sampling effort. Our results suggest that recording was skewed by relatively simple variables affecting collector activity, such as the perceived 'attractiveness' of mountainous landscapes and protected areas with recently described species, and accessibility of sampling sites (distance from main research centres). We emphasize the importance of these evaluation exercises, which are useful to locate areas needed of further sampling as well as to identify potential biases in the distribution of current biodiversity patterns.

AB Increasing dietary specialization is an inherently risky strategy because it increases a species' vulnerability to resource depletion. However, risks associated with dietary specialization may be offset by increased performance when feeding on preferred prey. Although rarely demonstrated, highly specialized species are expected to outperform generalists when feeding on their preferred prey, whereas generalists are predicted to have more similar performance across a range of different prey. To test this theory, we compared the growth rates of two obligate coral-feeding butterflyfishes (Chaetodon trifascialis and Chaetodon plebeius) maintained on exclusive diets of preferred vs nonpreferred prey. In the field, C. trifascialis was the most specialized species, feeding almost exclusively on just one coral species, Acropora hyacinthus. C. plebeius meanwhile, was much less specialized, but fed predominantly on Pocillopora damicornis. During growth experiments, C. trifascialis grew fastest when feeding on A. hyacinthus and did not grow at all when feeding on less preferred prey (P. damicornis and Porites cylindrica). C. plebeius performed equally well on both A. hyacinthus and P. damicornis (its preferred prey), but performed poorly when feeding on P. cylindrica. Both butterflyfishes select coral species that maximize juvenile growth, but contrary to expectations, the more specialized species (C. trifascialis) did not outperform the generalist species (C. plebeius) when both consumed their preferred prey. Increased dietary specialization, therefore, appears to be a questionable strategy, as there was no evidence of any increased benefits to offset increases in susceptibility to disturbance.

AB Most of the European diadromous fish species are endangered and listed in the habitats fauna and flora directive, the bern convention and the IUCN Red List. Current conservation plans do not address global warming issues and consider the 1900 distribution range as the reference without taking into account the potential re-distribution of these species under global warming. However, for other taxa, predictive models have been used successfully to relate conservation assessment with the impact of global warming. We investigated the distribution of the various diadromous species regularly encountered in Europe, North Africa and the Middle East at the beginning of the 20th century. For each species, we related the observed distribution to a set of environmental variables describing the prevailing climate in the basins, the physical nature of the basins and reflecting historical events known to have affected freshwater fish distribution. We successfully built twenty-one accurate species-specific models out of twenty-eight during both the calibration and the validation phases. Longitude, a factor we interpret as related to biogeographical history, was selected in all models and temperature was included in fifteen models, in six it was the most explanatory variable. These models allowed us to separate the roles of ecology and history in explaining distribution patterns at species level. Historical events such as glaciations constrained the continental distribution of all diadromous species and six of these were also highly temperature-dependent. Based on these results, we claim that these models can be used to predict the potential distribution under changing climatic conditions and provide two relevant examples (i.e. for Alosa alosa and Pe tromyzon marinus). Predictive models could be useful as a preliminary tool to prepare long-term conservation plans on European, national and regional scales. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

SO BIOLOGY LETTERS

ID MITOCHONDRIAL-DNA; BREEDING CYCLE; CONTROL-REGION; CONSERVATION;
   CALIFORNIA
AB Pinnipeds (seals, fur seals, sea lions and walrus) form large breeding aggregations with females often remaining faithful to a natal site or area. In these cases, females are philopatric to regional areas on broad geographical scales of hundreds to thousands of kilometres. An investigation of variation in a control region sequence of mtDNA in the Australian sea lion (Neophoca cinerea) has shown a case of extreme female natal site fidelity that has resulted in almost fixed population differentiation across its range (Phi(ST) = 0.93). This high level of population subdivision over short geographical distances (approx. 60 km) is unparalleled in any social marine mammal and reflects the unique lifehistory traits of this rare species. The high level of population subdivision and exclusive female natal site fidelity has important ramifications for conservation management, and poses many interesting questions of both academic and applied interest.

AB Following the accidental introduction of the carp Cyprinus carpio into Lake Naivasha during 1999, a sustainable population became rapidly established and in early 2004 became the principal species exploited in the commercial fishery. Over 9000 kg of carp were harvested from the lake between October 2005 and 2006, when fish were captured between fork lengths (L-F) 200 and 800 mm (>8 kg). Diet of carp < 100 mm L-F was dominated by zooplankton, >100 mm L-F there was a shift to benthic macro-invertebrates, with these carp feeding principally upon food resources previously unexploited by the fish community. Contrary to predictions and despite the increasing carp abundance, there has been macrophyte regeneration in littoral areas since 2004. There have been substantial increases in areal cover, with coverage in 2006 at levels not observed since the late 1980s, and significant increases in species richness. Possible reasons for this, and the significance of this carp introduction, are discussed. (c) 2007 The Authors Journal compilation (c) 2007 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles.

AB During the last 10 years, an increasing number of studies have explored evolutionary aspects of biological invasions. It is becoming increasingly clear that evolutionary processes play an important role during the establishment of non-native species. Genetic drift during the colonization process followed by strong selection imposed through a change in biotic conditions and co-evolutionary disequilibrium set the conditions for rapid evolutionary change in introduced populations. Different hypotheses, which have been proposed to explain how evolutionary and genetic processes, can facilitate invasiveness are explored and their relevance for fish invasions is discussed. Empirical evidence increasingly suggests that admixture after multiple introductions, hybridization between native and non-native species and enemy release can all catalyse the evolution of invasiveness. A number of studies also suggest that genetic bottlenecks might represent less of genetic paradox than previously thought. Much of the theoretical developments and empirical evidence concerning the importance of evolution during biological invasions has been provided from studies on invasive plants. Despite their prominence, fish invasions have received little attention from evolutionary biologists. Recent advances in population genetic analysis such as non-equilibrium methods and genomic techniques such as microarray technology provide suitable tools to address such issues.

AB Coordinated variation has been reported for leaf structure, composition and function, across and within species, and theoretically should occur across populations of a species that span an extensive environmental range. We focused on Hawaiian keystone tree species Metrosideros polymorpha, specifically, 13-year old trees grown (2-4 m tall) in a common garden (approximately 1 ha field with 2-3 m between trees) from seeds collected from 14 populations along an altitude-soil age gradient. We determined the genetic component of relationships among specific leaf area (SLA), the concentrations of nitrogen (N) and pigments (chlorophylls, carotenoids, and anthocyanins), and photosynthetic light-use efficiency. These traits showed strong ecotypic variation; SLA declined 35% with increasing source elevation, and area-based concentrations of N, Chl a + b and Car increased by 50, 109 and 96%, respectively. Concentrations expressed on a mass basis were not well related to source elevation. Pigment ratios expressed covariation that suggested an increased capacity for light harvesting at higher source elevation; Chl/N and Car/Chl increased with source elevation, whereas Chl a/b declined; Chl a/b was higher for populations on younger soil, suggesting optimization for low N supply. Parallel trends were found for the photosynthetic reactions; light-saturated quantum yield of photosystem II (phi(PSII)) and electron transport rate (ETR) increased with source elevation. Correlations of the concentrations of photosynthetic pigments, pigment ratios, and photosynthetic function across the ecotypes indicated a stoichiometric coordination of the components of the light-harvesting antennae and reaction centers. The constellation of coordinated morphological, biochemical and physiological properties was expressed in the leaf reflectance and transmittance properties in the visible and near-infrared wavelength region (400-950 nm), providing an integrated metric of leaf status among and between plant phenotypes.

AB Habitat-suitability modelling is being increasingly used as a tool for conservation biology. Although studies at large spatial scales are more appropriate for reserve design and management, there is a scarcity of published work on local, high-resolution applications of such models. In this work we develop high-resolution habitat models (1 ha) and study habitat preferences (focal points) of Dupont's lark Chersophilus duponti, an endangered shrub-steppe passerine, in the partially overlapping Special Protected Area for birds (SPA) and Important Bird Area (IBA) of "paramos de Layna" (NW Spain), to assess both the adequacy of the reserve's limits and the effect of land-use changes on the species' population size. Both analytical approaches show that the Dupont's lark favours flat areas characterized by small shrubs with bare ground, so that, for example, a conversion of dry crops to shrubs promoted by agri-environment schemes under CAP could increase the population size up to 80%. Although the IBA and SPA are similar in size - as compelled by EU environmental policy - the latter shows rugged topography typically avoided by the species. We further discuss the possible conflict between EU environmental and agricultural policies on the conservation of this species and suggest it can be addressed with our study approach.

AB Sierra Nevada forests have high understory species richness yet we do not know which site factors influence herb and shrub distribution or abundance. We examined the understory of an old-growth mixed-conifer Sierran forest and its distribution in relation to microsite conditions. The forest has high species richness (98 species sampled), most of which are herbs with sparse cover and relatively equal abundance. Shrub cover is highly concentrated in discrete patches. Using overstory tree cover and microsite environmental conditions, four habitats were identified; tree cluster, partial canopy, gap, and rock/shallow soil. Herb and shrub species were strongly linked with habitats. Soil moisture, litter depth and diffuse light were the most significant environmental gradients influencing understory plant distribution. Herb cover was most strongly influenced by soil moisture. Shrub cover is associated with more diffuse light, less direct light, and sites with lower soil moisture. Herb richness is most affected by conditions which influence soil moisture. Richness is positively correlated with litter depth, and negatively correlated with direct light and shrub cover. Disturbance or management practices which change forest floor conditions, shallow soil moisture and direct light are likely to have the strongest effect on Sierran understory abundance and richness.

AB Mitochondrial control region (mtDNA CR) diversity within and among 6 seahorse populations associated with the Indo-Pacific Hippocampus kuda complex (H. kuda from India, Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines, H. fuscus from the Red Sea and H. capensis from South Africa) was compared to determine whether there was support for the hypothesis that seahorses are able to colonize remote areas by means of rafting. Analyses performed on the data-set included phylogenetic reconstructions, estimation of relative population ages, tests for evidence of population expansion, pairwise migration rates and divergence times, as well as relationships between genetic and geographic distances. The mtDNA data indicate that all populations have undergone recent expansions, but that the timing of these events differed. The H. kuda population from India was found to be the oldest, whereas the expansion of the H. fuscus population from the Red Sea took place most recently. The fact that all seahorse populations studied are characterized by a single ancestral mtDNA haplotype and migration rates are low in most cases, as well as the fact that no significant relationship between genetic and geographic distances was found, indicates that colonization of distant habitats by a small number of founding individuals may be common in seahorses associated with the H. kuda complex. As the level of subsequent gene flow among populations is low, this may result in rapid speciation.

AB Plantago lanceolata plants were grown under various environmental conditions in association with the mycorrhizal fungi Glomus mosseae, G. caledonium and a fine endophyte either individually or all together. Using a time-course approach, we investigated the effects of elevated atmospheric CO2 (eCO(2)), soil warming and drought and their interactions on root length colonized (RLC) by mycorrhizal fungi and extraradical mycorrhizal hyphal (EMH) production. Plant growth responded as would be expected to the environmental manipulations. There was no plant growth-independent effect of eCO(2) on mycorrhizal colonization; however, EMH production was stimulated by eCO(2), i.e. there was increased partitioning of below-ground carbon to the EMH. Soil warming directly stimulated both percent RLC by the Glomus species and EMH density; soil warming did not affect RLC by the fine endophyte. Drought decreased percent RLC for the fine endophyte, but not for the Glomus species. The presence of one mycorrhizal fungus did not affect the response of another to the environmental variables. There was no evidence of any interactive effects of the environmental variables on RLC, but there were significant environmental interactions on EMH production. In particular, the stimulatory effects of eCO(2) and soil warming on EMH density were not additive. The results are discussed in terms of the soil carbon cycle, highlighting some crucial gaps in our knowledge. If future environmental changes affect mycorrhizal fungal turnover and respiration, then this could have important implications for the terrestrial carbon cycle.

AB Information regarding the instream response to long supra-seasonal droughts, extending over more than one season, in largely perennial riverine systems is fragmentary compared to knowledge regarding floods. The macroinvertebrate community of a groundwater dominated river was investigated over an eight-year period which included two supra-seasonal drought events (1992 and 1996-1997). The community responded directly to changes in the discharge regime. Significant differences in the community abundance, the abundance of the amphipod Gammarus pulex, diversity indices (Shannon Wiener and Simpson diversity) and the Berger-Parker dominance index were recorded between drought, flow recovery and other (non-drought) years. Drought conditions resulted in extremely low community abundance, Gammarus pulex abundance and the Berger-Parker dominance index, and extremely high values of the Shannon Wiener and Simpson diversity indices. Recovery of the community extended over a two-year period and reflected recovery of flow associated with recharge of the groundwater aquifer. The results underline the continuing need for medium to long-term data series to investigate the response of instream communities to flow variability so that extreme events can be placed within the context of natural variability.

AB A recent taxonomic revision of wandering albatross elevated each of the four subspecies to species. We used mitochondrial DNA and nine microsatellite markers to study the phylogenetic relationships of three species (Diomedea antipodensis, D. exulans and D. gibsoni) in the wandering albatross complex. A small number of samples from a fourth species, D. dabbenena, were analysed using mitochondrial DNA only. Mitochondrial DNA sequence analyses indicated the presence of three distinct groups within the wandering albatross complex: D. exulans, D. dabbenena and D. antipodensis/D. gibsoni. Although no fixed differences were found between D. antipodensis and D. gibsoni, a significant difference in the frequency of a single restriction site was detected using random fragment length polymorphism. Microsatellite analyses using nine variable loci, showed that D. exulans, D. antipodensis and D. gibsoni were genetically differentiated. Despite the widespread distribution of D. exulans, we did not detect any genetic differentiation among populations breeding on different island groups. The lower level of genetic differentiation between D. antipodensis and D. gibsoni should be reclassified as D. antipodensis. Within the context of the current taxonomy, these combined data support three species: D. dabbenena, D. exulans and D. antipodensis.

AB In species living in social groups, aggression among individuals to gain access to limiting resources can lead to the formation of stable social hierarchies. We tested whether dominance rank in social groups of sponge-dwelling cleaning gobies Elacatinus prochilos in Barbados was determined by physical attributes of individuals or by prior experience of dominance, and examined the foraging consequences of dominance rank. Intraspecific aggression within groups resulted in stable dominance hierarchies that were strongly correlated with fish length. Dominant individuals maintained exclusive territories while subordinate fish occupied broader home ranges. Larger, competitively dominant fish were able to monopolize areas inside the sponge lumen with the highest abundance of the polychaete Haplosyllis spp., a favoured prey item, and achieved the highest foraging rates. The removal of a territorial individual from large groups resulted in a domino-like effect in territory relocation of the remaining fish as individuals moved to the territory previously occupied by the individual just above them in the group hierarchy. Individuals added to existing groups generally failed to gain access to territories, despite being formerly dominant in their original groups. When given the opportunity to choose a location in the absence of larger competitors, gobies frequently preferred positions that were previously defended and that had abundant food. These results suggest that intraspecific competition for resources creates the observed dominance structures and provides support for the role of individual physical attributes in the formation and maintenance of dominance hierarchies.

AB Six variable microsatellite loci were used to examine genetic structuring in the closely related shy albatross (Thalassarche cauta) and white-capped albatross (T. steadi). First, levels of genetic differentiation between the species, and among three populations within each species, were analysed using AMOVA, F-ST and R-ST. We found high levels of genetic structuring and detected many unshared alleles between the species, which provide strong evidence against any contemporary gene flow between them. Within each species, shy albatross populations were found to be genetically distinct whereas white-capped albatross populations were undifferentiated, which implies that dispersal events are much rarer in the former than in the latter. These results formed the basis for the recommendation that the three white-capped albatross populations (as a whole) and each shy albatross population be treated as separate units for conservation. Second, levels of genetic diversity and allelic patterns in shy and white-capped albatrosses were assessed for whether they support earlier mtDNA results suggesting that shy albatrosses arose through range expansion of white-capped albatrosses. All measures indicated lower genetic diversity within shy albatrosses than within white-capped albatrosses and upheld the hypothesis that shy albatrosses were founded by white-capped albatrosses.

SO PLOS BIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID POPULATION BOTTLENECKS; MICROSATELLITE LOCI; HARDY-WEINBERG;
   PHYLOGEOGRAPHY
AB The origin of Borneo's elephants is controversial. Two competing hypotheses argue that they are either indigenous, tracing back to the Pleistocene, or were introduced, descending from elephants imported in the 16th-18th centuries. Taxonomically, they have either been classified as a unique subspecies or placed under the Indian or Sumatran subspecies. If shown to be a unique indigenous population, this would extend the natural species range of the Asian elephant by 1300 km, and therefore Borneo elephants would have much greater conservation importance than if they were a feral population. We compared DNA of Borneo elephants to that of elephants from across the range of the Asian elephant, using a fragment of mitochondrial DNA, including part of the hypervariable d-loop, and five autosomal microsatellite loci. We find that Borneo's elephants are genetically distinct, with molecular divergence indicative of a Pleistocene colonisation of Borneo and subsequent isolation. We reject the hypothesis that Borneo's elephants were introduced. The genetic divergence of Borneo elephants warrants their recognition as a separate evolutionary significant unit. Thus, interbreeding Borneo elephants with those from other populations would be contraindicated in ex situ conservation, and their genetic distinctiveness makes them one of the highest priority populations for Asian elephant conservation.

AB The sand goby Pomatoschistus minutus is a major component of marine shelf and estuarine food webs and an important study organism in behavioural research. Yet, despite the sand goby's significance, its past and present patterns of migration and gene flow are poorly understood. Here we use the mtDNA control region and parts of the flanking tRNA genes of 63 fish from six localities in the Adriatic (Eastern Mediterranean), Western Mediterranean, Atlantic, and North Sea to investigate the phylogeography of this gobiid. Phylogenetic analyses and population genetics statistics reveal the existence of an Evolutionarily Significant Unit, sensu Moritz (1994), in the Adriatic and another in the Western Mediterranean, Atlantic, and North Sea. A possible biogeographical scenario for the separation of the ancestral population is that sand gobies in the Adriatic and Western Mediterranean split between 10,000 and 5000 years ago when due to the rise in sea temperature they migrated northwards and were bisected by the Italian peninsula. A testable prediction of this scenario is that sand gobies from the Western Mediterranean, Adriatic, and Aegean form three reciprocally monophyletic groups which are the descendants of a three-way diversification event.

AB Leaf respiration and its temperature response were measured in 4-m-tall, 1-yr-old Populus deltoides trees to assess the effect of within-canopy distribution of respiratory physiology on total foliar C exchange of a model ecosystem at Biosphere 2.
   Over the course of five nights, air temperature was varied over a 10degreesC range and the steady-state rate of leaf respiration was measured. These data were then modeled to calculate the temperature response of leaf and canopy respiration.
   Results indicate that there is considerable within-canopy variation in both the rate of respiration and its temperature response and that these variables are most strongly related to leaf carbohydrate and leaf N. Scaling these results to the ecosystem level demonstrates the importance of quantifying the vertical distribution of respiratory physiology, particularly at lower temperatures.
   Simplifying assumptions regarding the variation in respiration and its temperature response with canopy height tend to result in an underestimation of the actual C loss if the assumptions are based on lower- or mid-canopy leaf physiology, but overestimate C loss if the model assumptions are based on upper-canopy physiology.

AB Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences were used to evaluate phylogeographic structure within and among populations of three endangered Hawaiian tree snail species (n = 86). The primary focus of this investigation was on setting conservation priorities for Achatinella mustelina. Limited data sets for two additional endangered Hawaiian tree snails, A. livida and A. sowerbyana, were also developed for comparative purposes. Pairwise genetic distance matrices and phylogenetic trees were generated, and an analysis of molecular variance was performed on 675-base pair cytochrome oxidase I gene sequences from multiple populations of Hawaiian tree snails. Sequence data were analysed under distance-based maximum-likelihood, and maximum-parsimony optimality criteria. Within the focal species, A. mustelina, numbers of variable and parsimony informative sites were 90 and 69, respectively. Pairwise intraspecific mtDNA sequence divergence ranged from 0 to 5.3% in A. mustelina, from 0 to 1.0% in A. livida and from 0 to 1.9% in A. sowerbyana. For A. mustelina, population genetic structure and mountain topography were strongly correlated. Maximum genetic distances were observed across deep, largely deforested valleys, and steep mountain peaks, independent of geographical distance. However, in certain areas where forest cover is presently fragmented, little mtDNA sequence divergence exists despite large geographical scales (8 km). Genetic data were used to define evolutionarily significant units for conservation purposes including decisions regarding placement of predator exclusion fences, captive propagation, re-introduction and translocation.

AB The three missions of Syslematics Agenda 2000 (SA2000)-to inventory Earth's species, to understand their relationships, and to use the latter to create predictive information systems-define an agenda of research for systmatic biology. The recognition that systematic knowledge underpins biological knowledge in general, and applied biology in particular, has resulted in an amazing growth in systematics over the past decade. Increasingly, systematics is being used to solve societal problems. This paper describes seven great questions within systematics and discusses their relevance for, and contribution to, conserving and sustainably using biodiversity. These questions fall into four broad categories: Questions about diversity: What is a species? and How many species are there? Questions about phylogeny: What is the Tree of Life? and What has been the history of character transformation? Questions about biogeography: Where are Earth's species distributed? and How have species distributions changed over time? and Questions about phyloinformatics: How is phylogenetic history predictive?.

AB The effects of prey heterogeneity and consumer identity on the strength of predator limitation of prey biomass were explored experimentally under controlled laboratory conditions. In this study, I utilized a model aquatic community composed of zooplankton as top predators, algae as prey, and nutrients as basal resources. To examine the effects of prey heterogeneity, I created a food chain initially composed of a single edible prey and a food web initially composed of a diverse assemblage of algae. These two prey treatments were then fully crossed with two predator treatments (a large-bodied zooplankter, Daphnia pulex, and a small-bodied species, Ceriodaphnia quadrangula), and two levels of productivity. Prey heterogeneity had clear effects on the ability of predators to limit overall prey biomass. In food chains, predators had strong negative effects on algae, and algal biomass exhibited a narrow response to enrichment. In contrast, predator limitation was weak in food webs with the consequence that predator and prey biomass both showed positive increases with productivity. The prey community in food webs also exhibited a striking increase in the relative abundance of lar-e inedible algae with enrichment, in keeping with model predictions. These results indicate that prey heterogeneity can have substantial effects on predator-prey dynamics and trophic structure and can serve to shift systems from strong top-down control to ones in which prey are colimited by predators and resources. Comparisons between top predators showed that Daphnia, compared to Ceriodaphnia, more strongly limited the biomass of large algae in food webs at high productivity and total algal biomass in all nutrient-enriched treatments (both chains and webs). Thus, consumer identity and ecological context (productivity and heterogeneity of prey communities) may mediate the strength of zooplankton-algae. interactions and the efficacy of trophic cascades.

AB Phylogenetic inference is well known to be problematic if both long and short branches occur together in the underlying tree. With biological data, correcting for this problem may require simultaneous consideration for both substitution biases and rate heterogeneity between lineages and across sequence positions. A particular form of the latter is the presence of invariable sites, which are well known to mislead estimation of genetic divergences. Here we describe a capture-recapture method to estimate the proportion of invariable sites in an alignment of amino acids or nucleotides. We use it to investigate phylogenetic signals in 18S ribosomal DNA sequences from Holometabolus insects. Our results suggest that, as taxa diverged, their 18S rDNA sequences have altered in both their distribution of sites that can vary as well. as in their base compositions.

AB 1 For over three decades the equilibrium theory of island biogeography has galvanized studies in ecological biogeography. Studies of oceanic islands and of natural habitat islands share some similarities to continental studies, particularly in developed regions where habitat fragmentation results from many land uses. Increasingly, remnant habitat is in the form of isolates created by the clearing and destruction of natural areas. Future evolution of a theory to predict patterns of species abundance may well come from the application of island biogeography to habitat fragments or isolates.
   2 In this paper we consider four factors other than area and isolation that influence the number and type of mammal species coexisting in one place: habitat diversity, habitat disturbance, species interactions and guild assembly rules. In all examples our data derive from mainland habitat, fragmented to differing degrees, with different levels of isolation.
   3 Habitat diversity is seen to be a good predictor of species richness. Increased levels of disturbance produce a relatively greater decrease in species richness on smaller than on larger isolates. Species interactions in the recolonization of highly disturbed sites, such as regenerating mined sites, is analogous to island colonization. Species replacement sequences in secondary successions indicate not just how many, but which species are included. Lastly, the complement of species established on islands, or in insular habitats, may be governed by guild assembly rules. These contributions may assist in taking a renewed theory into the new millennium.

AB We tested integrative bottom-up and top-down trophic cascade hypotheses with manipulative experiments in a tropical wet forest, using the ant-plant Piper cenocladum and its associated arthropod community. We examined enhanced nutrients and light along with predator and herbivore exclusions as sources of variation in the relative biomass of plants, their herbivores (via rates of herbivory), and resident predaceous ants. The combined manipulations of secondary consumers, primary consumers, and plant resources allowed us to examine some of the direct and indirect effects on each trophic level and to determine the relative contributions of bottom-up and top-down cascades to the structure of the community. We found that enhanced plant resources (nutrients and light) had direct positive effects on plant biomass. However, we found no evidence of indirect (cascading through the herbivores) effects of plant biomass on predators or top predators. In contrast, ants had indirect effects on plant biomass by decreasing herbivory on the plants. This top-down cascade occurred whether or not plant resources were enriched, conditions which are expected to modify top-down farces.

AB Single Scots pines (Pinus sylvestris L.), aged 20-25 years, were grown in open-top chambers and exposed to elevated temperature (Elev. T), elevated CO2 (Elev. C) and a combination of elevated CO2 and temperature (Elev. C + T) for 3 years. The vertical distribution of needle nitrogen concentration was measured simultaneously with gas exchange of attached shoots. Based on the measurements, the dependencies on needle nitrogen concentrations of four photosynthetic parameters, i.e., RuP2 (ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate)-saturated rate of carboxylation (V-cmax), maximum potential electron transport (J(max)), the rate of respiration in the light (R-d) and light-use-efficiency factor (delta), were determined. Using a crown multilayer model, the performance of daily crown photosynthesis in Scots pine was predicted. Compared to the control treatment, the mean concentration of nitrogen in the foliage decreased by 20% and by 17% for trees grown under Elev. C and under Elev. C + T, respectively, but increased by 4% for trees grown under Elev. T. However, the total content of foliage nitrogen per unit ground area increased by 25% for trees grown under Elev. C, by 19% for trees grown under Elev. C + T and by 6% for trees grown under Elev. T; these were due to the increase in the total needle area index. Regressions showed that the foliage grown under Elev. C and Elev. C + T had steeper slopes representing the responses of V-cmax, and R-d and delta to leaf nitrogen concentrations, while Elev. C + T and Elev. T had steeper slopes representing the response of J(max) to needle nitrogen concentrations. Predictions showed that, on a typical sunny day, the daily total of crown photosynthesis increased 22% and 27%, separately for Elev. C and Elev. C + T, and by only 9% for Elev. T alone. Furthermore, the increased daily crown photosynthesis, resulting from treatments involving elevated CO2, can be attributed mainly to an increase in the ambient CO2 concentration and the needle area index, while modification of the intrinsic photosynthetic capacity had only a marginal effect. Based on the current pattern of crown nitrogen allocation, the prediction showed also that the relationship between daily crown photosynthesis and crown nitrogen content was strongly dependent on the daily incident PAR and air temperature. The CO2-elevated treatments led to an increase in the sensitivity of daily crown photosynthesis to changes in crown nitrogen content, daily incident PAR and temperature, while the temperature-elevated treatment had the opposite effect on the sensitivity.

AB The diversity of plant life forms in tropical forests affords the opportunity for assembly of plant combinations, both natural and managed, that make full use of resources and sustain high productivity. The influence of combining life forms on productivity and resource use was evaluated using three fast-growing tree species (Hyeronima alchorneoides, Cedrela odorata, and Cordia alliodora); each species was grown alone and with two perennial, large-stature, self-supporting monocots (Euterpe oleracea and Heliconia imbricata).
   Aboveground net primary productivity was extremely high in all stands. The monocots did not contribute significantly to the productivity of the Hyeronima polycultures, which was 4.5-8.4 g.m(-2).d(-1) between 18 and 36 mo. In contrast, the monocots accounted for 57% of the productivity (9.7 g.m(-2).d(-1)) of Cedrela polycultures and 67% of the productivity (6.8 g.m(-2).d(-1)) of the Cordia polycultures, by age 3 yr. The leaf area and density of fine roots in the Cedrela and Cordia polycultures were also significantly increased by the presence of the monocots, reaching or surpassing the levels found in the Hyeronima stands.
   The high productivity of Hyeronima, coupled with poor growth of its interplanted monocots, indicated that Hyeronima was able to achieve nearly complete use of resources. Ecosystem productivity and resource capture were increased when the monocots were grown with the other two tree species, and this occurred because of the inability of the tree species to completely utilize available resources, which provided an opportunity for the monocots to flourish in the understory. Monocot productivity in the Cedrela stands was additive to that of the trees, indicating complementary resource use between the monocots and this tree species. In the case of Cordia, tree productivity was slowed by the monocots, but this decline was more than compensated for by the high productivity of the associated monocots.
   Whether in natural forests or human-constructed agroforestry systems, the presence of dominant species that do not fully exploit all available resources allows the coexistence of other species and creates the potential for complementary resource use. The resource use characteristics of such species should be a key consideration in forest restoration efforts and in the design of sustainable land use systems.

AB Notopala sublineata, Notopala hanleyi (Viviparidae) and Thiara balonnensis (Thiaridae) are prosobranch gastropods that were once abundant in the lower River Murray. These and other snail taxa have declined markedly over the last 50 years, coinciding with increased flow regulation by dams and weirs. In this paper we speculate that the decline may be linked to changes in the nature of food resources. Before regulation, most of the biofilm biomass in the lower Murray probably was microbial, as fluctuating; water levels and high turbidity would have maintained these communities in a state of early succession. By stabilising seasonal water levels, we suggest that regulation has promoted the growth of filamentous algae, perhaps at the expense of bacteria. Evidence from gut and faecal pellet analysis, and from analysis of carbon stable-isotopes, suggests that the gastropod taxa are detritivores, feeding mainly on amorphous organic detritus. Algae have a relatively high C:N ratio (low nutritional value) and may be an inadequate food to maintain female growth and reproduction, especially in viviparous snails.

AB We performed reciprocal transplants of different Borrichia clones between offshore islands in Pinellas County, Florida, to assess the relative strengths of environment and genotype on the success of the gall midge Asphondylia borrichiae. We measured gall abundance, gall size, gall abortion rate, parasitism rate, stem-tip diameter, nitrogen level, and parasitoid community composition from both experimental and native plants. We found a significant effect of plant clone and environment on all these variables with the exception of gall abortion rate. The effect of environment was usually stronger than that of genotype. This is an unusual result. At sites with higher densities of galls, plants were higher in nitrogen, had bigger stem tips, and produced larger galls. Bigger galls suffered lower parasitism because the smallest species of the parasitoid guild, which is also the most common species, was largely excluded from large galls. The interaction between plant clone and environment was significant for all variables, including abortion rate, which indicates that plant responses, herbivore density, and herbivore mortality are phenotypically plastic. while some authors have found significant interactions between plant genotype and site on herbivore densities, the demonstration of similar phenomena on natural-enemy attack rates and abortion rates of galls is novel. at least for a natural system. In this system, ''bottom-up'' factors indirectly determine the strength of ''top-down'' central from parasitoids, by regulating the size of galls.

AB This paper addresses two main questions. First, can evergreen foliage that has been structurally determined as sun foliage acclimate physiologically when it is shaded? Second, is this acclimation independent of the foliage ageing process and source-sink relations? To investigate these questions, a shading and debudding experiment was established using paired branches on open-grown Abies amabilis trees. For each tree, one branch was either shaded, debudded, or both, from before budbreak until the end of summer, while the other branch functioned as a control. Foliage samples were measured both prior to and during treatment for photosynthesis at light saturation (A(max)), dark respiration, nitrogen content, chlorophyll content, chlorophyll-to-nitrogen ratio and chlorophyll a:b ratio. All age classes of foliage responded similarly during the treatment, although pre-treatment values differed between age classes. Within 1 month after the treatment began, A(max) was lower in shaded foliage and remained lower throughout the treatment period. For debudded branches, A(max) was lower than the controls only during active shoot elongation, At the end of the treatments in September, A(max) in shade-treated sun foliage matched the rates in the true shade-formed foliage, but nitrogen remained significantly higher. By 1.5 months after treatment, chlorophyll content in shaded foliage was higher than in controls, and the chlorophyll a:b ratio was lower for the shaded foliage. On debudded branches, chlorophyll content and chlorophyll a:b ratio were similar to the values in control samples. Shading lowered the rate of nitrogen accumulation within a branch, while removing debudding decreased the amount of sequestered N that was exported from the older foliage to supply new growth. By September, chlorophyll content in shade-treated foliage was higher than that in the control sun foliage or in true shade foliage. The chlorophyll increase as a result of shading was unexpected. However, the chlorophyll-to-nitrogen ratio was identical for the shade-treated sun foliage and the true shade foliage while being significantly lower than the control sun foliage. It appears that acclimation to shading in mature foliage involves a reallocation of nitrogen within the leaf into thylakoid proteins. A redistribution of resources (nitrogen) among leaves is secondary and appears to function on a slower time scale than reallocation within the leaf. Thus, A. amabilis foliage that is structurally determined as sun foliage can acclimate to shade within a few months; this process is most likely independent of ageing and is only slightly affected by source-sink relations within a branch.

AB The experiment reported examined the effect of sheep trampling and grazing during wet conditions on soil physical properties and pasture growth over three winter seasons. The soil type studied was a structurally unstable sandy clay loam (a calcic red-brown earth) located in a dryland agricultural area (307 mm average annual rainfall) of Western Australia. Deferred grazing was investigated as a management option to reduce structural deterioration at the soil surface. Changes in soil physical properties as a result of trampling were related to soil water storage and pasture productivity.
   Infiltration rates were reduced as a result of sheep trampling, but there were no measurable changes in soil bulk density. Differences in pasture production between continuously grazed and ungrazed treatments were related to the amount of stored soil water, which in turn was related to infiltration rates. Pasture root growth during the season was also reduced as a result of trampling. Deferred grazing yielded the same quantity of biomass for feed over the reduced period available for grazing and proved to be a beneficial management practice since reasonably high infiltration rates were maintained. Results from the study also indicated that pasture must be adequately grazed to reduce leaf area later in the season when evaporative demand increases. A high leaf area over this time period may result in early pasture senescence.

AB A literature review indicates that coral reef sea urchins out-compete herbivorous fishes (i.e. scarids and acanthurids), and reach maximum biomass levels an order of magnitude higher than herbivorous reef fishes. Additionally, sea urchins have lower respiration and food consumption rates, and at high biomass levels appear to reduce algal resources to levels lower than herbivorous fishes. A simple biomass-based energetic model was developed to help explain these patterns and to determine the energetic properties of organisms which affect their resource competitive ability and ability to sustain themselves under predation. Simulations of a hypothetical herbivore indicate that herbivore steady-state biomass increases with decreasing consumption rates, but a parabolic relationship was found between herbivore biomass and the level to which the herbivore reduces its food resource (i.e. R *). Simulations of competition between hypothetical herbivores indicate that only the level to which a herbivore reduces its resource (R *) was important in determining the superior resource competitor, although biomass dynamics differed depending on feeding, gross production rates, and initial conditions of competitors. High herbivore consumption and gross production increase rates of biomass recruitment. But, unless an herbivore can also keep resources below the level competitors can tolerate, a high rate of gross production does not insure the competitor superior resource competitive ability in the absence of predators. Yet the model also predicts that organisms with high gross production and consumption rates are able to persist better under high levels of harvesting by predators. The model suggests that sea urchins reach high biomass due to low algal consumption rates and out-compete herbivorous fishes, when their predators are reduced (i.e. often attributable to overfishing), by reducing algal biomass to low levels. Sea urchins appear to tolerate low algal biomass due to their low consumption and respiration rates which allows them to persist at low levels of net algal productivity. But, low sea urchin gross production makes them less likely to persist under high levels of harvesting or predation. The model suggests that organisms may frequently need to make energetic trade-offs between traits which will give them superior resource competitive ability and tolerance to predation or disturbance.

Warigal) was grown in a glasshouse in deep pots (0.125x0.125x1.2m) containing sieved solonized brown soil (calcixerollic xerochrept) comprising 0.2 m sandy loam topsoil above 0.6 m treated calcareous sandy loam subsoil and a base layer of light clay 0.26 m thick. The subsoil was treated with a mixture of salts (0, 13, 39, 75 mmol(c) kg-1) and with boric acid (0, 20, 38 and 73 mg B kg-1) in factorial combination. The soil was initially watered to field capacity and water use was determined by regularly weighing the pots. The soil was allowed to dry gradually during the season, but the weights of the pots were not permitted to fall below that corresponding to 17% of the available water holding capacity of the soil.
   Tillering, dry weight of shoots and grain, and root length density were determined. Water-use efficiency was calculated with respect to total dry weight and grain production.
   Salt decreased tiliering, dry matter production, grain yield, root length and water-use efficiency (total dry weight): it increased sodium and decreased boron concentrations in the plants. Boron decreased dry matter production (but not tillering), grain yield, root length and water-use efficiency (total dry weight and grain yield): it increased the concentrations of boron and decreased the concentration of sodium in the plants. At the concentrations of salt and boron used (which cover the range normally encountered in subsoils in much of Upper Eyre Peninsula), boron had more deleterious effects on wheat than did salt. Yield was depressed by salt at concentrations of sodium in the tissue commonly found in field-grown plants.

TI QUANTIFICATION OF ACTIVE VESICULAR ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAL INFECTION
   USING IMAGE-ANALYSIS AND OTHER TECHNIQUES
SO AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID ROOTS; FUNGI; COLONIZATION; GROWTH
AB Methods for the objective measurement of vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal infection in the roots of four species of host plant are described. The methods are based on vital staining of transverse sections of fresh roots, followed by evaluation of occurrence and/or numbers of living arbuscules and hyphae per section. The most useful method involved freeze-sectioning roots embedded in gelatin containing glycerol and DMSO, followed by staining the sections with nitroblue tetrazolium overnight to reveal succinate dehydrogenase activity.
   Two systems of computer-aided image analysis were evaluated for measurement of the number, perimeter and cross-sectional areas of intercellular hyphae and arbuscules. This approach, which is clearly objective, is an advance on previous methods which were based on ranking sections or segments of root with respect to the intensity of development of arbuscules. The data were used to calculate the area of interface between plant and fungus in infected roots. Results are presented showing that the contribution of arbuscules to the total infection and area of interface declines markedly as plants and infections age. Differences in infection in different host/fungus combinations are also described.

AB Aim Although species distribution models (SDMs) traditionally link species occurrences to free-air temperature data at coarse spatio-temporal resolution, the distribution of organisms might instead be driven by temperatures more proximal to their habitats. Several solutions are currently available, such as downscaled or interpolated coarse-grained free-air temperatures, satellite-measured land surface temperatures (LST) or in-situ-measured soil temperatures. A comprehensive comparison of temperature data sources and their performance in SDMs is, however, currently lacking. Location Northern Scandinavia. Time period 1970-2017. Major taxa studied Higher plants. Methods We evaluated different sources of temperature data (WorldClim, CHELSA, MODIS, E-OBS, topoclimate and soil temperature from miniature data loggers), differing in spatial resolution (from 1 '' to 0.1 degrees), measurement focus (free-air, ground-surface or soil temperature) and temporal extent (year-long versus long-term averages), and used them to fit SDMs for 50 plant species with different growth forms in a high-latitudinal mountain region. Results Differences between these temperature data sources originating from measurement focus and temporal extent overshadow the effects of temporal climatic differences and spatio-temporal resolution, with elevational lapse rates ranging from -0.6 degrees C per 100 m for long-term free-air temperature data to -0.2 degrees C per 100 m for in-situ soil temperatures. Most importantly, we found that the performance of the temperature data in SDMs depended on the growth forms of species. The use of in-situ soil temperatures improved the explanatory power of our SDMs (R-2 on average +16%), especially for forbs and graminoids (R-2 +24 and +21% on average, respectively) compared with the other data sources. Main conclusions We suggest that future studies using SDMs should use the temperature dataset that best reflects the ecology of the species, rather than automatically using coarse-grained data from WorldClim or CHELSA.

AB Conserving threatened species requires identifying where across their range they are being impacted by threats, yet this remains unresolved across most of Earth. Here, we present a global analysis of cumulative human impacts on threatened species by using a spatial framework that jointly considers the co-occurrence of eight threatening processes and the distribution of 5,457 terrestrial vertebrates. We show that impacts to species are widespread, occurring across 84% of Earth's surface, and identify hotspots of impacted species richness and coolspots of unimpacted species richness. Almost one-quarter of assessed species are impacted across >90% of their distribution, and approximately 7% are impacted across their entire range. These results foreshadow localised extirpations and potential extinctions without conservation action. The spatial framework developed here offers a tool for defining strategies to directly mitigate the threats driving species' declines, providing essential information for future national and global conservation agendas.
   Author summary The biggest drivers of global biodiversity loss are hunting, harvesting, and the conversion of natural habitats for agriculture, urbanisation, and other industrial activity. However, our understanding of where these threats' actually impact sensitive species is extremely limited across Earth. Here, we map the distribution of threats within the known ranges of 5,457 terrestrial birds, mammals, and amphibians globally. We map only those threats within a species range that are known to specifically endanger that species. We show that threats are extensive across the majority of species' ranges, severely limiting the area within which species can survive. Concerningly, 1,237 species (almost one-quarter of those assessed) are impacted by threats across >90% of their distribution, and 395 species are impacted by threats across their entire range. These species will almost certainly face extinction without conservation intervention to remove threats. We identify global hotspots of impacted species richness and also coolspots' that act as refuges from threats, providing essential information for conservation planning and action.

AB Eleven statistical and machine learning tools are analyzed and applied to hourly solar irradiation forecasting for time horizon from 1 to 6 h. A methodology is presented to select the best and most reliable forecasting model according to the meteorological variability of the site. To make the conclusions more universal, solar data collected in three sites with low, medium and high meteorological variabilities are used: Ajaccio, Tilos and Odeillo. The datasets variability is evaluated using the mean absolute log return value. The models were compared in term of normalized root mean square error, mean absolute error and skill score. The most efficient models are selected for each variability and temporal horizon: for the weak variability, auto-regressive moving average and multi-layer perceptron are the most efficient, for a medium variability, auto-regressive moving average and bagged regression tree are the best predictors and for a high one, only more complex methods can be used efficiently, bagged regression tree and the random forest approach.

AB Rapid industrialization and urbanization has led to severe environmental issues in China. Energy, water, and CO2 are among the most important factors that influence urban sustainability. In this study, we investigated the energy-water-carbon nexus of urban sectors in Shanghai and Beijing in 2012. The energy consumption, water use, and CO2 emissions of sectors in Shanghai and Beijing were estimated by applying the environmental input-output model. Our findings indicated that the service industry, with 8.69 x 10(14) kJ embodied energy, 2.60 x 10(9) m(3) embodied water, and 41.72 Mt embodied CO2, was the largest energy and water consumer and the largest CO2 emitter in Beijing. In Shanghai, service industry ranked highest in terms of embodied energy (8.67 x 10(14) kJ), embodied water (4.25 x 10(9) m(3)), and embodied CO2 (48.72 Mt). We defined the consumption (emission) coefficient and consumption (emission) index to analyze the sectoral energy-water-carbon nexus in Beijing and Shanghai, and proposed sustainable development recommendations for different sectors with various energy-water-carbon characteristics. The consumption (emission) indexes can act as a reference for each city, showing the sectors that need to be emphasized and preferentially managed. In Beijing, policymakers may need to focus on the following sectors: sector coal mining and selecting and sector electricity, gas, and water production and supply. In Shanghai, sector electricity, gas, and water production and supply and sector transport, storage and post should receive the greatest attention. For most of the studied sectors, the environmental pressures per unit output (expressed by the consumption (emission) coefficients) in Shanghai were higher than those in Beijing, indicating that Shanghai is facing greater environmental challenges in the process of urban sustainability. The energy-water-carbon nexus characteristics of each sector may offer new perspectives to tackle the environmental challenges during the achievement of urban sustainability. This approach also provides a way for other cities to determine sectors that should receive the most attention in terms of easing environmental stress during the urban sustainable development process.

AB Genetic erosion is a major threat to biodiversity because it can reduce fitness and ultimately contribute to the extinction of populations. Here, we explore the use of quantitative metrics to detect and monitor genetic erosion. Monitoring systems should not only characterize the mechanisms and drivers of genetic erosion (inbreeding, genetic drift, demographic instability, population fragmentation, introgressive hybridization, selection) but also its consequences (inbreeding and outbreeding depression, emergence of large-effect detrimental alleles, maladaptation and loss of adaptability). Technological advances in genomics now allow the production of data the can be measured by new metrics with improved precision, increased efficiency and the potential to discriminate between neutral diversity (shaped mainly by population size and gene flow) and functional/adaptive diversity (shaped mainly by selection), allowing the assessment of management-relevant genetic markers. The requirements of such studies in terms of sample size and marker density largely depend on the kind of population monitored, the questions to be answered and the metrics employed. We discuss prospects for the integration of this new information and metrics into conservation monitoring programmes.

AB 1. Plant traits can be used to predict ecosystem responses to environmental change using a response-effect trait framework. To do this, appropriate traits must be identified that explain a species' influence on ecosystem function (effect traits) and the response of those species to environmental change (response traits). Response traits are often identified and measured along gradients in plant resources, such as water availability; however, precipitation explains very little variation in most plant traits globally. Given the strong relationship between plant traits and ecosystem functions, such as net primary productivity (NPP), and between NPP and precipitation, the lack of correlation between precipitation and plant traits is surprising.
   2. We address this issue through a systematic review of >500 published studies that describe plant trait responses to altered water availability. The overarching goal of this review was to identify potential causes for the weak relationship between commonly measured plant traits and water availability so that we may identify more appropriate response traits.
   3. We attribute weak trait-precipitation relationships to an improper selection of traits (e.g., nonhydraulic traits) and a lack of trait-based approaches that adjust for trait variation within communities (only 4% of studies measure community-weighted traits). We then highlight the mechanistic value of hydraulic traits as more appropriate response traits with regard to precipitation, which should be included in future community-scale trait surveys.
   4. based ecology has the potential to improve predictions of ecosystem responses to predicted changes in precipitation; however, this predictive power depends heavily on the identification of reliable response and effect traits. To this end, trait surveys could be improved by a selection of traits that reflect physiological functions directly related to water availability with traits weighted by species relative abundance.

AB The functional trait approach has, as a central tenet, that plant traits are functional and shape individual performance, but this has rarely been tested in the field. Here, we tested the individual-based trait approach in a hyperdiverse Amazonian tropical rainforest and evaluated intraspecific variation in trait values, plant strategies at the individual level, and whether traits are functional and predict individual performance.
   We evaluated > 1300 tree saplings belonging to > 383 species, measured 25 traits related to growth and defense, and evaluated the effects of environmental conditions, plant size, and traits on stem growth.
   A total of 44% of the trait variation was observed within species, indicating a strong potential for acclimation. Individuals showed two strategy spectra, related to tissue toughness and organ size vs leaf display. In this nutrient- and light-limited forest, traits measured at the individual level were surprisingly poor predictors of individual growth performance because of convergence of traits and growth rates.
   Functional trait approaches based on individuals or species are conceptually fundamentally different: the species-based approach focuses on the potential and the individual-based approach on the realized traits and growth rates. Counterintuitively, the individual approach leads to a poor prediction of individual performance, although it provides a more realistic view on community dynamics.

AB Understanding variation in leaf functional traits-including rates of photosynthesis and respiration and concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus-is a fundamental challenge in plant ecophysiology. When expressed per unit leaf area, these traits typically increase with leaf mass per area (LMA) within species but are roughly independent of LMA across the global flora. LMA is determined by mass components with different biological functions, including photosynthetic mass that largely determines metabolic rates and contains most nitrogen and phosphorus, and structural mass that affects toughness and leaf lifespan (LL). A possible explanation for the contrasting trait relationships is that most LMA variation within species is associated with variation in photosynthetic mass, whereas most LMA variation across the global flora is associated with variation in structural mass. This hypothesis leads to the predictions that (i) gas exchange rates and nutrient concentrations per unit leaf area should increase strongly with LMA across species assemblages with low LL variance but should increase weakly with LMA across species assemblages with high LL variance and that (ii) controlling for LL variation should increase the strength of the above LMA relationships. We present analyses of intra-and interspecific trait variation from three tropical forest sites and interspecific analyses within functional groups in a global dataset that are consistent with the above predictions. Our analysis suggests that the qualitatively different trait relationships exhibited by different leaf assemblages can be understood by considering the degree to which photosynthetic and structural mass components contribute to LMA variation in a given assemblage.

AB Spatial heterogeneity in the environment induces variation in population demographic rates and dispersal patterns, which result in spatio-temporal variation in density and gene flow. Unfortunately, applying theory to learn about the role of spatial structure on populations has been hindered by the lack of mechanistic spatial models and inability to make precise observations of population state and structure. Spatial capture-recapture (SCR) represents an individual-based analytic framework for overcoming this fundamental obstacle that has limited the utility of ecological theory. SCR methods make explicit use of spatial encounter information on individuals in order to model density and other spatial aspects of animal population structure, and they have been widely adopted in the last decade. We review the historical context and emerging developments in SCR models that enable the integration of explicit ecological hypotheses about landscape connectivity, movement, resource selection, and spatial variation in density, directly with individual encounter history data obtained by new technologies (e.g. camera trapping, non-invasive DNA sampling). We describe ways in which SCR methods stand to advance the study of animal population ecology.

AB Anthropogenic warming is projected to trigger positive feedbacks to climate by enhancing carbon losses from the soil(1). While such losses are, in part, due to increased decomposition of organic matter by invertebrate detritivores, it is unknown how detritivore feeding activity will change with warming(2), especially under drought conditions. Here, using four-year manipulation experiments in two North American boreal forests, we investigate how temperature (ambient, ambient + 1.7 degrees C and ambient +3.4 degrees C) and rainfall (ambient and -40% of the summer precipitation) perturbations influence detritivore feeding activity. In contrast to general expectations(1,3), warming had negligible net effects on detritivore feeding activity at ambient precipitation. However, when combined with precipitation reductions, warming decreased feeding activity by similar to 14%. Across all plots and dates, detritivore feeding activity was positively associated with bulk soil microbial respiration. These results suggest slower rates of decomposition of soil organic matter and thus reduced positive feedbacks to climate under anthropogenic climate change.

AB Global vegetation models use conceived relationships between functional traits to simulate ecosystem responses to environmental change. In this context, the concept of the leaf economics spectrum (LES) suggests coordinated leaf trait variation, and separates species which invest resources into short-lived leaves with a high expected energy return rate from species with longer-lived leaves and slower energy return. While it has been assumed that being fast (acquisitive) or slow (conservative) is a general feature for all organ systems, the translation of the LES into a root economics spectrum (RES) for tree species has been hitherto inconclusive. This may be partly due to the assumption that the bulk of tree fine roots have similar uptake functions as leaves, despite the heterogeneity of their environments and resources. In this study we investigated well-established functional leaf and stature traits as well as a high number of fine root traits (14 traits split by different root orders) of 13 dominant or subdominant temperate tree species of Central Europe, representing two phylogenetic groups (gymnosperms and angiosperms) and two mycorrhizal associations (arbuscular and ectomycorrhizal). We found reflected variation in leaf and lower-order root traits in some (surface areas and C: N) but not all (N content and longevity) traits central to the LES. Accordingly, the LES was not mirrored belowground. We identified significant phylogenetic signal in morphological lower-order root traits, i.e., in root tissue density, root diameter, and specific root length. By contrast, root architecture (root branching) was influenced by the mycorrhizal association type which developed independent from phylogeny of the host tree. In structural equation models we show that root branching significantly influences both belowground (direct influence on root C: N) and aboveground (indirect influences on specific leaf area and leaf longevity) traits which relate to resource investment and lifespan. We conclude that branching of lower order roots can be considered a leading root trait of the plant economics spectrum of temperate trees, since it relates to the mycorrhizal association type and belowground resource exploitation; while the dominance of the phylogenetic signal over environmental filtering makes morphological root traits less central for tree economics spectra across different environments.

AB During active fire incidents, decisions regarding where and how to safely and effectively deploy resources to meet management objectives are often made under rapidly evolving conditions, with limited time to assess management strategies or for development of backup plans if initial efforts prove unsuccessful. Under all but the most extreme fire weather conditions, topography and fuels are significant factors affecting potential fire spread and burn severity. We leverage these relationships to quantify the effects of topography, fuel characteristics, road networks and fire suppression effort on the perimeter locations of 238 large fires, and develop a predictive model of potential fire control locations spanning a range of fuel types, topographic features and natural and anthropogenic barriers to fire spread, on a 34000km(2) landscape in southern Idaho and northern Nevada. The boosted logistic regression model correctly classified final fire perimeter locations on an independent dataset with 69% accuracy without consideration of weather conditions on individual fires. The resulting fire control probability surface has potential for reducing unnecessary exposure for fire responders, coordinating pre-fire planning for operational fire response, and as a network of locations to incorporate into spatial fire planning to better align fire operations with land management objectives.

AB Droughts are large-scale perturbations that affect freshwater ecosystems worldwide. A water level reduction caused by drought is an important driving factor of phytoplankton dynamics. It has been suggested that a water level reduction alters the light and mixing regime and increases nutrient concentrations and phytoplankton biomass favoring cyanobacterial blooms. We took advantage of two exceptionally dry years in the Brazilian semi-arid region to investigate the effects of the water level reduction on the water quality and phytoplankton communities of two shallow man-made lakes. In both lakes, the water level was reduced by half, while the water turbidity, conductivity, and nutrient concentrations increased. In the deeper lake, the phytoplankton biomass increased and was dominated by a cyanobacteria group as expected, but it decreased in the shallower lake and was dominated by mixotrophic flagellate groups. This was because of sediment resuspension by wind and fish facilitated by a water level reduction and increased the water turbidity more strongly in the shallower than in the deeper lake. Therefore, a water level reduction caused by a drought may either increase or decrease the phytoplankton biomass and cyanobacteria dominance in tropical shallow lakes depending on the lake depth and the concentration of inorganic suspended sediments.

AB Characterizing the impacts of climatic change on hydrologic processes is critical for managing freshwater systems. Specifically, there is a need to evaluate how the two major components of streamflow, baseflow and stormflow, have responded to recent trends in climate. We derive baseflow and stormflow for 674 sites throughout the United States from 1980 to 2010 to examine their associations with precipitation, potential evapotranspiration, and maximum/minimum temperature. The northeastern (NE) and southwestern (SW) United States display consistent trends in baseflow and stormflow: increasing during fall and winter in the NE and decreasing during all seasons in the SW. Trends elsewhere and at other times of the year are more variable but still associated with changes in climate. Counter to expectations, baseflow and stormflow trends throughout the United States tend to change concurrently. These trends are primarily associated with precipitation trends, but increases in PET are influential and likely to become important in the future.

AB To persist in an ocean changing in temperature, pH and other stressors related to climate change, many marine species will likely need to acclimatize or adapt to avoid extinction. If marine populations possess adequate genetic variation in tolerance to climate change stressors, species might be able to adapt to environmental change. Marine climate change research is moving away from single life stage studies where individuals are directly placed into projected scenarios ('future shock' approach), to focus on the adaptive potential of populations in an ocean that will gradually change over coming decades. This review summarizes studies that consider the adaptive potential of marine invertebrates to climate change stressors and the methods that have been applied to this research, including quantitative genetics, laboratory selection studies and trans- and multigenerational experiments. Phenotypic plasticity is likely to contribute to population persistence providing time for genetic adaptation to occur. Transgenerational and epigenetic effects indicate that the environmental and physiological history of the parents can affect offspring performance. There is a need for long-term, multigenerational experiments to determine the influence of phenotypic plasticity, genetic variation and transgenerational effects on species' capacity to persist in a changing ocean. However, multigenerational studies are only practicable for short generation species. Consideration of multiple morphological and physiological traits, including changes in molecular processes (eg, DNA methylation) and long-term studies that facilitate acclimatization will be essential in making informed predictions of how the seascape and marine communities will be altered by climate change.

AB Urbanisation is a key driver of land use change and urban growth is set to continue. The provision of ecosystem services depends on the existence of greenspace. Urban morphology is potentially an important influence on ecosystem services. Therefore, it may be possible to promote service provision through an urban structure that supplies the processes and functions that underpin them. However, an understanding of the ability of urban areas to produce multiple ecosystem services, and the spatial pattern of their production, is required. We demonstrate an approach using easily accessible data, to generate maps of key urban ecosystem services for a case study city of Sheffield, UK. Urban greenspace with a mixture of land covers allowed areas of high production of multiple services in the city centre and edges. But crucially the detection of such 'hotspots' depended on the spatial resolution of the mapping unit. This shows there is potential to design cities to promote hotspots of production. We discuss how land cover type, its spatial location and how this relates to different suites of services, is key to promoting urban multifunctionality. Detecting trade-offs and synergies associated with particular urban designs will enable more informed decisions for achieving urban sustainability. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB We propose the Stream Biome Gradient Concept as a way to predict macroscale biological patterns in streams. This concept is based on the hypothesis that many abiotic and biotic features of streams change predictably along climate (temperature and precipitation) gradients because of direct influences of climate on hydrology, geomorphology, and interactions mediated by terrestrial vegetation. The Stream Biome Gradient Concept generates testable hypotheses related to continental variation among streams worldwide and allows aquatic scientists to understand how results from one biome might apply to a less-studied biome. Some predicted factors change monotonically across the biome/climate gradients, whereas others have maxima or minima in the central portion of the gradient. For example, predictions across the gradient from drier deserts through grasslands to wetter forests include more permanent flow, less bare ground, lower erosion and sediment transport rates, decreased importance of autochthonous C inputs to food webs, and greater stream animal species richness. In contrast, effects of large ungulate grazers on streams are expected to be greater in grasslands than in forests or deserts, and fire is expected to have weaker effects in grassland streams than in desert and forest streams along biome gradients with changing precipitation and constant latitude or elevation. Understanding historic patterns among biomes can help describe the evolutionary template at relevant biogeographic scales, can be used to broaden other conceptual models of stream ecology, and could lead to better management and conservation across the broadest scales.

AB International ports are generally considered the most likely points of entry for alien wood-boring beetles. A better understanding of the factors affecting their arrival and establishment at ports and their surrounding areas is of utmost importance to improve the efficacy and the cost-effectiveness of early detection programmes. Our work aimed at understanding how port size and the characteristics of the landscape surrounding the port, in terms of forest cover and forest composition, influence the occurrence of alien wood-boring beetles. From May to September 2012, 15 Italian international ports and the surrounding forests were monitored with multi-funnel traps baited with a multi-lure blend (-pinene, ethanol, ipsdienol, ipsenol, methyl-butenol), three in each port and three in forests located 3-5km away from the port. We identified both alien and native Scolytinae, Cerambycidae and Buprestidae beetles. Fourteen alien species, among which four are new to Italy, were trapped. Alien species richness was positively related to the amount of imported commodities at the port scale. Broadleaf forests surrounding ports received larger number of alien species than conifer forests. By contrast, total forest cover in the landscape surrounding ports was positively related to the occurrence of native but not alien species. The alien and native species richness was higher in the surrounding forests than in the ports.Synthesis and applications. The simultaneous use of traps in ports with large volume of imported commodities and in their surrounding broadleaf forests can strongly increase the probability of alien wood-boring beetle interceptions. The identification of sites where the arrival and establishment of alien species is more probable, combined with an efficient trapping protocol, can substantially improve the efficacy of early detection. Similar approaches may be used in other countries as early warning systems to implement timely measures to eradicate or contain alien invasions at the European scale.

TI Supplanting ecosystem services provided by scavengers raises greenhouse

SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
LA English
DT Article
ID CLIMATE-CHANGE; SANITARY; VULTURE; CONSERVATION; POLICIES
AB Global warming due to human-induced increments in atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases (GHG) is one of the most debated topics among environmentalists and politicians worldwide. In this paper we assess a novel source of GHG emissions emerged following a controversial policy decision. After the outbreak of bovine spongiform encephalopathy in Europe, the sanitary regulation required that livestock carcasses were collected from farms and transformed or destroyed in authorised plants, contradicting not only the obligations of member states to conserve scavenger species but also generating unprecedented GHG emission. However, how much of this emission could be prevented in the return to traditional and natural scenario in which scavengers freely remove livestock carcasses is largely unknown. Here we show that, in Spain (home of 95% of European vultures), supplanting the natural removal of dead extensive livestock by scavengers with carcass collection and transport to intermediate and processing plants meant the emission of 77,344 metric tons of CO2 eq. to the atmosphere per year, in addition to annual payments of ca. $50 million to insurance companies. Thus, replacing the ecosystem services provided by scavengers has not only conservation costs, but also important and unnecessary environmental and economic costs.

AB Ecosystem responses to changes in species diversity are often studied individually. However, changes in species diversity can simultaneously influence multiple interdependent ecosystem functions. Therefore, an important challenge is to determine when and how changes in species diversity that influence one function will also drive changes in other functions. By providing the underlying structure of species interactions, ecological networks can quantify connections between biodiversity and multiple ecosystem functions. Here, we review parallels in the conceptual development of biodiversity-ecosystem functioning (BEF) and food web theory (FWT) research. Subsequently, we evaluate three common principles that unite these two research areas by explaining the patterns, concentrations, and direction of the flux of nutrients and energy through the species in diverse interaction webs. We give examples of combined BEF-FWT approaches that can be used to identify vulnerable species and habitats and to evaluate links that drive trade-offs between multiple ecosystems functions. These combined approaches reflect promising trends towards better management of biodiversity in landscapes that provide essential ecosystem services supporting human well-being.

   analysis
AB Background: Population connectivity, which is essential for the persistence of benthic marine metapopulations, depends on how life history traits and the environment interact to influence larval production, dispersal and survival. Although we have made significant advances in our understanding of the spatial and temporal dynamics of these individual processes, developing an approach that integrates the entire population connectivity process from reproduction, through dispersal, and to the recruitment of individuals has been difficult. We present a population connectivity modelling framework and diagnostic approach for quantifying the impact of i) life histories, ii) demographics, iii) larval dispersal, and iv) the physical seascape, on the structure of connectivity and metapopulation dynamics. We illustrate this approach using the subtidal rocky reef ecosystem of Port Phillip Bay, were we provide a broadly-applicable framework of population connectivity and quantitative methodology for evaluating the relative importance of individual factors in determining local and system outcomes.
   Results: The spatial characteristics of marine population connectivity are primarily influenced by larval mortality, the duration of the pelagic larval stage, and the settlement competency characteristics, with significant variability imposed by the geographic setting and the timing of larval release. The relative influence and the direction and strength of the main effects were strongly consistent among 10 connectivity-based metrics.
   Conclusions: These important intrinsic factors (mortality, length of the pelagic larval stage, and the extent of the precompetency window) and the spatial and temporal variability represent key research priorities for advancing our understanding of the connectivity process and metapopulation outcomes.

AB We performed a quantitative and qualitative analysis of the scientific literature on ecosystem services in order to help tracing a research agenda for agricultural sciences. The ecosystem services concept now lies at the heart of current developments to address global environmental change. Do agricultural sciences generate knowledge that covers this emerging theme? An analysis of scientific production allowed us to return to the ecological origins of this concept and see how little it has been appropriated by agricultural sciences until now, despite major focus on the issue of agro-ecosystems in the literature. Agricultural sciences tend to be more active in the field of environmental services, defined as services rendered by humans to ecosystems. The main studied services are those which have already been clearly identified and which act in synergy. Less attention is paid to the antagonisms between different services. These findings call for the implementation of agricultural research programmes that will consider the socio-agro-ecosystem as a whole and broaden the traditional issues addressed by agricultural sciences. We insist on three main management and operational issues that needs to be overcome if this is to be done: working at the landscape scale, increasing inter disciplinary collaborations and take uncertainties into account.

AB Lower Central America (LCA) provides a geologically complex and dynamic, richly biodiverse model for studying the recent assembly and diversification of a Neotropical biota. Here, we review the growing literature of LCA phylogeography studies and their contribution to understanding the origins, assembly, and diversification of the LCA biota against the backdrop of regional geologic and climatic history, and previous biogeographical inquiry. Studies to date reveal that phylogeographical signal within taxa of differing distributions reflects a diversity of patterns and processes rivalling the complexities of LCA landscapes themselves. Even so, phylogeography is providing novel insights into regional diversification (e.g. cryptic lineage divergences), and general evolutionary patterns are emerging. Congruent multi-taxon phylogeographic breaks are found across the Nicaraguan depression, Chorotega volcanic front, western and central Panama, and the Darien isthmus, indicating that a potentially shared history of responses to regional-scale (e.g. geological) processes has shaped the genetic diversity of LCA communities. By contrast, other species show unique demographic histories in response to overriding historical events, including no phylogeographic structure at all. These low-structure or incongruent patterns provide some evidence for a role of local, ecological factors (e.g. long-distance dispersal and gene flow in plants and bats) in shaping LCA communities. Temporally, comparative phylogeographical structuring reflects Pliocene-Pleistocene dispersal and vicariance events consistent with the timeline of emergence of the LCA isthmus and its major physiographic features, e.g. cordilleras. We emphasise the need to improve biogeographic inferences in LCA through in-depth comparative phylogeography projects capitalising on the latest statistical phylogeographical methods. While meeting the challenges of reconstructing the biogeographical history of this complex region, phylogeographers should also take up the critical service to society of applying their work to the conservation of its fascinating biodiversity.

AB Agroecosystems contain complex networks of interacting organisms and these interaction webs are structured by the relative timing of key biological and ecological events. Recent intensification of land management and global changes in climate threaten to desynchronize the temporal structure of interaction webs and disrupt the provisioning of ecosystem services, such as biological control by natural enemies. It is therefore critical to recognize the central role of temporal dynamics in driving predator-prey interactions in agroecosystems. Specifically, ecological dynamics in crop fields routinely behave as periodic oscillations, or cycles. Familiar examples include phenological cycles, diel activity rhythms, and crop-management cycles. The relative timing and the degree of overlap among ecological cycles determine the nature and magnitude of the ecological interactions among organisms, and ultimately determine whether ecosystem services, such as biological control, can be provided. Additionally, the ecological dynamics in many cropping systems are characterized by a pattern of frequent disturbances due to management actions such as harvest, sowing and pesticide applications. These disturbance cycles cause agroecosystems to be dominated by dispersal and repopulation dynamics. However, they also serve as selective filters that regulate which animals can persist in agroecosystems over larger temporal scales. Here, we review key concepts and examples from the literature on temporal dynamics in ecological systems, and provide a framework to guide biological control strategies for sustainable pest management in a changing world.

AB The climate-driven dynamics of species ranges is a critical research question in evolutionary ecology. We ask whether present intraspecific diversity is determined by the imprint of past climate. This is an ongoing debate requiring interdisciplinary examination of population genetic pools and persistence patterns across global ranges. Previously, contrasting inferences and predictions have resulted from distinct genomic coverage and/or geographical information. We aim to describe and explain the causes of geographical contrasts in genetic diversity and their consequences for the future baseline of the global genetic pool, by comparing present geographical distribution of genetic diversity and differentiation with predictive species distribution modelling (SDM) during past extremes, present time and future climate scenarios for a brown alga, Fucus vesiculosus. SDM showed that both atmospheric and oceanic variables shape the global distribution of intertidal species, revealing regions of persistence, extinction and expansion during glacial and postglacial periods. These explained the distribution and structure of present genetic diversity, consisting of differentiated genetic pools with maximal diversity in areas of long-term persistence. Most of the present species range comprises postglacial expansion zones and, in contrast to highly dispersive marine organisms, expansions involved only local fronts, leaving distinct genetic pools at rear edges. Besides unravelling a complex phylogeographical history and showing congruence between genetic diversity and persistent distribution zones, supporting the hypothesis of niche conservatism, range shifts and loss of unique genetic diversity at the rear edge were predicted for future climate scenarios, impoverishing the global gene pool.

AB Root knot nematodes (RKN) can infect most of the world's agricultural crop species and are among the most important of all plant pathogens. As yet however we have little understanding of their origins or the genomic basis of their extreme polyphagy. The most damaging pathogens reproduce by obligatory mitotic parthenogenesis and it has been suggested that these species originated from interspecific hybridizations between unknown parental taxa. We have sequenced the genome of the diploid meiotic parthenogen Meloidogyne floridensis, and use a comparative genomic approach to test the hypothesis that this species was involved in the hybrid origin of the tropical mitotic parthenogen Meloidogyne incognita. Phylogenomic analysis of gene families from M. floridensis, M. incognita and an outgroup species Meloidogyne hapla was carried out to trace the evolutionary history of these species' genomes, and we demonstrate that M. floridensis was one of the parental species in the hybrid origins of M. incognita. Analysis of the M. floridensis genome itself revealed many gene loci present in divergent copies, as they are in M. incognita, indicating that it too had a hybrid origin. The triploid M. incognita is shown to be a complex double-hybrid between M. floridensis and a third, unidentified, parent. The agriculturally important RKN have very complex origins involving the mixing of several parental genomes by hybridization and their extreme polyphagy and success in agricultural environments may be related to this hybridization, producing transgressive variation on which natural selection can act. It is now clear that studying RKN variation via individual marker loci may fail due to the species' convoluted origins, and multi-species population genomics is essential to understand the hybrid diversity and adaptive variation of this important species complex. This comparative genomic analysis provides a compelling example of the importance and complexity of hybridization in generating animal species diversity more generally.

AB Large, intense fires are generators of heterogeneity in many ecosystems. An important component of this heterogeneity is the occurrence of unburnt patches within the fire boundary: these fulfil a number of ecological functions including serving as refuges for fire-sensitive organisms. An important issue for land managers is the degree to which potential refuges occur 'naturally' versus occurring as a result of interventions such as planned burning. Here, we examine the factors contributing to the occurrence of unbumt patches within the Kilmore-Murrindindi fire complex, a severe wildfire that encompassed similar to 250,000 ha and resulted in 159 human fatalities in Victoria, Australia, in 2009. Though an extreme event, this fire is representative of large, intense fires that periodically occur in south-eastern Australia. Unburnt patches >= 1 ha occupied less than 1% of the area within the fire boundary, with mean size of 27.1 ha (range 1-306 ha). Overall, the probability of points within the fire boundary remaining unbumt was most strongly influenced by topographic position, vegetation type and fire intensity in the surrounding area. In dry eucalypt forest, time since fire (a surrogate for fuel structure) was also important. The influence of all factors was strongly contingent on prevailing weather during the fire, with no unburnt patches occurring in extreme fire conditions. In this fire, most unburnt patches arose 'naturally' due to microclimatic effects of topography and vegetation. While fuel reduction burning has the potential to create unbumt patches in some circumstances, these are likely to exhibit simpler vegetation structure than those arising due to microclimate. Potential refuges in the form of unburnt patches are more likely to arise in landscapes with greater topographic and vegetational variation. Conversely, in more uniform environments, fuel load and/or continuity are likely to have a greater influence on the occurrence of unbumt patches. Understanding these relationships will assist fire managers in directing resources at producing ecological outcomes that are less likely to arise without intervention. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB Forests, through the regulation of regional water balances, provide a number of ecosystem services, including water for agriculture, hydroelectric power generation, navigation, industry, fisheries, and human consumption. Large-scale deforestation triggers complex non-linear interactions between the atmosphere and biosphere, which may impair such important ecosystem services. This is the case for the Southwestern Amazon, where three important river basins (Jurua, Purus, and Madeira) are undergoing significant land-use changes. Here, we investigate the potential impacts of deforestation throughout the Amazon on the seasonal and annual water balances of these river basins using coupled climatic and hydrologic models under several deforestation scenarios. Simulations without climate response to deforestation show an increase in river discharge proportional to the area deforested in each basin, whereas those with climate response produce progressive reductions in mean annual precipitation over all three basins. In this case, deforestation decreases the mean annual discharge of the Jurua and Purus rivers, but increases that of the Madeira, because the deforestation-induced reduction in evapotranspiration is large enough to increase runoff and thus offset the reduction in precipitation. The effects of Amazon deforestation on river discharge are scale-dependent and vary across and within river basins. Reduction in precipitation due to deforestation is most severe at the end of the dry season. As a result, deforestation increases the dry-season length and the seasonal amplitude of water flow. These effects may aggravate the economic losses from large droughts and floods, such as those experienced in recent years (2005, 2010 and 2009, 2012, respectively).

AB The consequences of climate change for bird populations have received much attention in recent decades, especially amongst cavity-nesting songbirds, yet little has been written on ducks (Anatidae) despite these being major elements of wetland diversity and important quarry species. This paper reviews the major known consequences of climate change for birds in general, and relates these to the limited information available specifically for ducks. Climate change can influence migration distance and phenology, potentially affecting patterns of mortality, as well as distribution and reproductive success in ducks. Studies addressing effects of climate change are, however, restricted to very few duck species, including mallard Anas platyrhynchos and common eider Somateria mollissima. Shifts in winter duck distributions have been observed, whereas the mismatch hypothesis (mistiming between the periods of peak energy requirements for young and the peak of seasonal food availability) has received limited sup-port with regard to ducks. We propose a range of monitoring initiatives, including population surveys, breeding success monitoring schemes and individual duck marking, which should later be integrated through population modelling and adaptive management to fill these gaps.

AB Activity budgets can provide a direct link to an animals bioenergetic budget and is thus a valuable unit of measure when assessing human-induced nonlethal effects on wildlife conservation status. However, activity budget inference can be challenging for species that are difficult to observe and require multiple observational variables. Here, we assessed whether whalewatching boat interactions could affect the activity budgets of minke whales (Balaenoptera acutorostrata). We used a stepwise modeling approach to quantitatively record, identify, and assign activity states to continuous behavioral time series data, to estimate activity budgets. First, we used multiple behavioral variables, recorded from continuous visual observations of individual animals, to quantitatively identify and define behavioral types. Activity states were then assigned to each sampling unit, using a combination of hidden and observed states. Three activity states were identified: nonfeeding, foraging, and surface feeding (SF). From the resulting time series of activity states, transition probability matrices were estimated using first-order Markov chains. We then simulated time series of activity states, using Monte Carlo methods based on the transition probability matrices, to obtain activity budgets, accounting for heterogeneity in state duration. Whalewatching interactions reduced the time whales spend foraging and SF, potentially resulting in an overall decrease in energy intake of 42%. This modeling approach thus provides a means to link short-term behavioral changes resulting from human disturbance to potential long-term bioenergetic consequences in animals. It also provides an analytical framework applicable to other species when direct observations of activity states are not possible.

AB Autophagy is a macromolecular degradation pathway by which cells recycle their contents as a developmental process, housekeeping mechanism, and response to environmental stress. In plants, autophagy involves the sequestration of cargo to be degraded, transport to the cell vacuole in a double-membrane bound autophagosome, and subsequent degradation by lytic enzymes. Autophagy has generally been considered to be a non-selective mechanism of degradation. However, studies in yeast and animals have found numerous examples of selective autophagy, with cargo including proteins, protein aggregates, and organelles. Recent work has also provided evidence for several types of selective autophagy in plants. The degradation of protein aggregates was the first selective autophagy described in plants, and, more recently, a hybrid protein of the mammalian selective autophagy adaptors p62 and NBR1, which interacts with the autophagy machinery and may function in autophagy of protein aggregates, was described in plants. Other intracellular components have been suggested to be selectively targeted by autophagy in plants, but the current evidence is limited. Here, we discuss recent findings regarding the selective targeting of cell components by autophagy in plants.

AB Climate change is driving species range shifts worldwide. However, physiological responses related to distributional changes are not fully understood. Oceanographers have reported an increase in ocean temperature in the northwest Iberian Peninsula that is potentially related to the decline in some cold-temperate intertidal macroalgae in the Cantabrian Sea, namely Fucus serratus. Low tide stress could also play a role in this decline. We performed one mensurative (in situ) and two manipulative (in culture) experiments designed to evaluate the interactive effects of some physical factors. The first experiment analysed field response to low tide stress in marginal (mid-Cantabrian Sea and northern Portugal) versus central (Galicia) populations of F. serratus. Then a second experiment was performed that utilized either harsh or mild summer conditions of atmospheric temperature, irradiance, humidity, and wind velocity to compare the responses of individuals from one marginal and one central population to low tide stress. Finally, the combined effect of sea temperature and the other factors was evaluated to detect interactive effects. Changes in frond growth, maximal photosynthetic quantum yield (F (v)/F (m)), temperature, and desiccation were found. Three additive factors (solar irradiation, ocean and air temperatures) were found to drive F. serratus distribution, except under mildly humid conditions that ameliorated atmospheric thermal stress (two additive factors). Mid-Cantabrian Sea temperatures have recently increased, reaching the inhibitory levels suggested in this study of F. serratus. We also expect an additive secondary contribution of low tide stress to this species decline. On the northern Portugal coast, ocean warming plus low tide stress has not reached this species' inhibition threshold. No significant differential responses attributed to the population of origin were found. Mechanistic approaches that are designed to analyse the interactive effects of physical stressors may improve the levels of confidence in predicted range shifts of species.

AB While it is generally assumed that specialist species are more vulnerable to disturbance compared with generalist counterparts, this has rarely been tested in coastal marine ecosystems, which are increasingly subject to a wide range of natural and anthropogenic disturbances. Habitat specialists are expected to be more vulnerable to habitat loss because habitat availability exerts a greater limitation on population size, but it is also possible that specialist species may escape effects of disturbance if they use habitats that are generally resilient to disturbance. This study quantified specificity in use of different coral species by six coral-dwelling damselfishes (Chromis viridis, C. atripectoralis, Dascyllus aruanus, D. reticulatus, Pomacentrus moluccensis, and P. amboinensis) and related habitat specialization to proportional declines in their abundance following habitat degradation caused by outbreaks of the coral eating starfish, Acanthaster planci. The coral species preferred by most coral-dwelling damselfishes (e. g., Pocillopora damicornis) were frequently consumed by coral eating crown-of-thorns starfish, such that highly specialized damselfishes were disproportionately affected by coral depletion, despite using a narrower range of different coral species. Vulnerability of damselfishes to this disturbance was strongly correlated with both their reliance on corals and their degree of habitat specialization. Ongoing disturbances to coral reef ecosystems are expected, therefore, to lead to fundamental shifts in the community structure of fish communities where generalists are favored over highly specialist species.

TI The Nutrient-Load Hypothesis: Patterns of Resource Limitation and

AB Resource competition theory predicts that the outcome of competition for two nutrients depends on the ratio at which these nutrients are supplied. Yet there is considerable debate whether nutrient ratios or absolute nutrient loads determine the species composition of phytoplankton and plant communities. Here we extend the classical resource competition model for two nutrients by including light as additional resource. Our results suggest the nutrient-load hypothesis, which predicts that nutrient ratios determine the species composition in oligotrophic environments, whereas nutrient loads are decisive in eutrophic environments. The underlying mechanism is that nutrient enrichment shifts the species interactions from competition for nutrients to competition for light, which favors the dominance of superior light competitors overshadowing all other species. Intermediate nutrient loads can generate high biodiversity through a fine-grained patchwork of two-species and three-species coexistence equilibria. Depending on the species traits, however, competition for nutrients and light may also produce multiple alternative stable states, suppressing the predictability of the species composition. The nutrient-load hypothesis offers a solution for several discrepancies between classical resource competition theory and field observations, explains why eutrophication often leads to diversity loss, and provides a simple conceptual framework for patterns of biodiversity and community structure observed in nature.

AB Most species with lengthy migrations display some degree of natal homing; some (e.g. migratory birds and anadromous salmonids) show spectacular feats of homing. However, studies of the sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) indicate that this anadromous species locates spawning habitat based on pheromonal cues from larvae rather than through philopatry. Previous genetic studies in the anadromous Pacific lamprey (Entosphenus tridentatus) have both supported and rejected the hypothesis of natal homing. To resolve this, we used nine microsatellite loci to examine the population structure in 965 Pacific lamprey from 20 locations from central British Columbia to southern California and supplemented this analysis with mitochondrial DNA restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis on a subset of 530 lamprey. Microsatellite analysis revealed (i) relatively low but often statistically significant genetic differentiation among locations (97% pairwise FST values were <0.04 but 73.7% were significant); and (ii) weak but significant isolation by distance (r2 = 0.0565, P = 0.0450) but no geographic clustering of samples. The few moderate FST values involved comparisons with sites that were geographically distant or far upstream. The mtDNA analysisalthough providing less resolution among sites (only 4.7%FST values were significant)was broadly consistent with the microsatellite results: (i) the southernmost site and some sites tributary to the Salish Sea were genetically distinct; and (ii) southern sites showed higher haplotype and private haplotype richness. These results are inconsistent with philopatry, suggesting that anadromous lampreys are unusual among species with long migrations, but suggest that limited dispersal at sea precludes panmixia in this species.

AB Agricultural practices are essential for sustaining the human population, but at the same time they can directly disrupt ecosystem functioning. Ecological risk assessment (ERA) aims to estimate possible adverse effects of human activities on ecosystems and their parts. Current ERA practices, however, incorporate very little ecology and base the risk estimates on the results of standard tests with several standard species. The main obstacles for a more ecologically relevant ERA are the lack of clear protection goals and the inherent complexity of ecosystems that is hard to approach empirically. In this paper, we argue that the ecosystem services framework offers an opportunity to define clear and ecologically relevant protection goals. At the same time, ecological models provide the tools to address ecological complexity to the degree needed to link measurement endpoints and ecosystem services, and to quantify service provision and possible adverse effects from human activities. We focus on the ecosystem services relevant for agroecosystem functioning, including pollination, biocontrol and eutrophication effects and present modeling studies relevant for quantification of each of the services. The challenges of the ecosystem services approach are discussed as well as the limitations of ecological models in the context of ERA. A broad, multi-stakeholder dialog is necessary to aid the definition of protection goals in terms of services delivered by ecosystems and their parts. The need to capture spatio-temporal dynamics and possible interactions among service providers pose challenges for ecological models as a basis for decision making. However, we argue that both fields are advancing quickly and can prove very valuable in achieving more ecologically relevant ERA. (C)11 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Aim
   It has been qualitatively understood for a long time that climate change will have widely varying effects on human well-being in different regions of the world. The spatial complexities underlying our relationship to climate and the geographical disparities in human demographic change have, however, precluded the development of global indices of the predicted regional impacts of climate change on humans. Humans will be most negatively affected by climate change in regions where populations are strongly dependent on climate and favourable climatic conditions decline. Here we use the relationship between the distribution of human population density and climate as a basis to develop the first global index of predicted impacts of climate change on human populations.
   Location
   Global.
   Methods
   We use spatially explicit models of the present relationship between human population density and climate along with forecasted climate change to predict climate vulnerabilities over the coming decades. We then globally represent regional disparities in human population dynamics estimated with our ecological niche model and with a demographic forecast and contrast these disparities with CO2 emissions data to quantitatively evaluate the notion of moral hazard in climate change policies.
   Results
   Strongly negative impacts of climate change are predicted in Central America, central South America, the Arabian Peninsula, Southeast Asia and much of Africa. Importantly, the regions of greatest vulnerability are generally distant from the high-latitude regions where the magnitude of climate change will be greatest. Furthermore, populations contributing the most to greenhouse gas emissions on a per capita basis are unlikely to experience the worst impacts of climate change, satisfying the conditions for a moral hazard in climate change policies.
   Main conclusions
   Regionalized analysis of relationships between distribution of human population density and climate provides a novel framework for developing global indices of human vulnerability to climate change. The predicted consequences of climate change on human populations are correlated with the factors causing climate change at the regional level, providing quantitative support for many qualitative statements found in international climate change assessments.

AB Many species are responding to global climate change by shifting their ranges poleward in latitude or upward in elevation. We analyze an integrodifference equation that combines growth, dispersal, and a constant-speed, climate-induced range shift and find that a shifting population can die out, even if the width of its range remains constant. We show how to determine the critical range-shift speed (for extinction) and study the effects of the growth rate and of the shape and scale of the dispersal kernel on persistence.

AB Observations and ocean state estimates are used to investigate the nature and mechanism of decadal variability in the East Australian Current (EAC) system and South Pacific subtropical gyre. A 62 year record on the Tasmanian continental shelf shows decadal variations of temperature and salinity, as well as a long-term trend, which has been related to wind-driven variations in the poleward extension of the EAC. Repeat expendable bathythermograph lines spanning the last 15 years suggest that low-frequency variations in the transport of the EAC extension and Tasman Front are anticorrelated, but the time series are too short to draw firm conclusions. Here we use two ocean state estimates spanning the past 50 years to diagnose the physical mechanisms and spatial structure of the decadal variability of the South Pacific subtropical gyre. The observations and state estimates paint a consistent picture of the decadal variability of the gyre and EAC system. Strengthening of the basin-wide wind stress curl drives a southward expansion of the subtropical gyre. As the gyre shifts south, the EAC extension pathway is favored at the expense of the Tasman Front, resulting in the observed anticorrelation of the these two major currents. The results suggest that the subtropical gyre and western boundary current respond to decadal variability in basin-scale wind stress curl, consistent with Island Rule dynamics; that strong decadal variability of the South Pacific gyre complicates efforts to infer trends from short-term records; and that wind stress curl changes over the South Pacific basin drive changes in the EAC system that are likely to have implications for marine ecosystems and regional climate.

AB Background and Aims Functional trait differences and trait adjustment in response to influences of the biotic environment could reflect niche partitioning among species. In this study, we tested how variation in above-ground plant traits, chosen as indicators for light and nitrogen acquisition and use, differs among taxonomically closely related species (Poaceae) to assess their potential for niche segregation at increasing plant diversity.
   Methods Traits of 12 grass species were measured in experimental grasslands (Jena Experiment) of varying species richness (from 1 to 60) and presence of particular functional groups (grasses, legumes, tall herbs and small herbs).
   Key Results Grass species increased shoot and leaf length, investment into supporting tissue (stem mass fraction) and specific leaf area as well as reduced foliar delta C-13 values with increasing species richness, indicating higher efforts for light acquisition. These species-richness effects could in part be explained by a higher probability of legume presence in more diverse communities. Leaf nitrogen concentrations increased and biomas s : N ratios in shoots decreased when grasses grew with legumes, indicating an improved nitrogen nutrition. Foliar delta N-15 values of grasses decreased when growing with legumes suggesting the use of depleted legume-derived N, while decreasing delta N-15 values with increasing species richness indicated a shift in the uptake of different N sources. However, efforts to optimize light and nitrogen acquisition by plastic adjustment of traits in response to species richness and legume presence, varied significantly among grass species. It was possible to show further that trait adjustment of grass species increased niche segregation in more diverse plant communities but that complementarity through niche separation may differ between light and nutrient acquisition.
   Conclusions The results suggest that even among closely related species such as grasses different strategies are used to cope with neighbours. This lack in redundancy in turn may facilitate complementary resource use and coexistence.

AB Riverine habitats are vulnerable to a host of environmental stressors, many of which are increasing in frequency and intensity across the globe. Climate change is arguably the greatest threat on the horizon, with serious implications for freshwater food webs via alterations in thermal regimes, resource quality and availability, and hydrology. This will induce radical restructuring of many food webs, by altering the identity of nodes, the strength and patterning of interactions and consequently the dynamics and architecture of the trophic network as a whole. Although such effects are likely to be apparent globally, they are predicted to be especially rapid and dramatic in high altitude and latitude ecosystems, which represent 'sentinel systems'. The complex and subtle connections between members of a food web and potential synergistic interactions with other environmental stressors can lead to seemingly counterintuitive responses to perturbations that cannot be predicted from the traditional focus of studying individual species in isolation. In this review, we highlight the need for developing new network-based approaches to understand and predict the consequences of global change in running waters.

AB Access management is among the most important conservation actions for grizzly bears in North America. In Alberta, Canada, nearly all grizzly bear mortalities are caused by humans and occur near roads and trails. Consequently, understanding how bears move relative to roads is of crucial importance for grizzly bear conservation. We present the first application of step-selection functions to model habitat selection and movement of grizzly bears. We then relate this to a step-length analysis to model the rate of movement through various habitats. Grizzly bears of all sex and age groups were more likely to select steps closer to roads irrespective of traffic volume. Roads are associated with habitats attractive to bears such as forestry cutblocks, and models substituting cutblocks for roads outperformed road models in predicting bear selection during day, dawn, and dusk time periods. Bear step lengths increased near roads and were longest near highly trafficked roads indicating faster movement when near roads. Bear selection of roads was consistent throughout the day; however, time of day had a strong influence over selection of forest structure and terrain variables. At night and dawn, bears selected forests of intermediate age between 40 and 100 yr, and bears selected older forests during the day. At dawn, bears selected steps with higher solar radiation values, whereas, at dusk, bears chose steps that were significantly closer to edges. Because grizzly bears use areas near roads during spring and most human-caused mortalities occur near roads, access management is required to reduce conflicts between humans and bears. Our results support new conservation guidelines in western North America that encourage the restriction of human access to roads constructed for resource extraction.

AB The spatial distribution of genetic diversity is a product of recent and historical ecological processes, as well as anthropogenic activities. A current challenge in population and conservation genetics is to disentangle the relative effects of these processes, as a first step in predicting population response to future environmental change. In this investigation, we compare the influence of contemporary population decline, contemporary ecological marginality and postglacial range shifts. Using classical model comparison procedures and Bayesian methods, we have identified postglacial range shift as the clear determinant of genetic diversity, differentiation and bottlenecks in 29 populations of butternut, Juglans cinerea L., a North American outcrossing forest tree. Although butternut has experienced dramatic 20th century decline because of an introduced fungal pathogen, our analysis indicates that recent population decline has had less genetic impact than postglacial recolonization history. Location within the range edge vs. the range core also failed to account for the observed patterns of diversity and differentiation. Our results suggest that the genetic impact of large-scale recent population losses in forest trees should be considered in the light of Pleistocene-era large-scale range shifts that may have had long-term genetic consequences. The data also suggest that the population dynamics and life history of wind-pollinated forest trees may provide a buffer against steep population declines of short duration, a result having important implications for habitat management efforts, ex situ conservation sampling and population viability analysis.

AB The entire Australian marine jurisdictional area, including offshore and sub-Antarctic islands, is considered in this paper. Most records, however, come from the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) around the continent of Australia itself. The counts of species have been obtained from four primary databases (the Australian Faunal Directory, Codes for Australian Aquatic Biota, Online Zoological Collections of Australian Museums, and the Australian node of the Ocean Biogeographic Information System), but even these are an underestimate of described species. In addition, some partially completed databases for particular taxonomic groups, and specialized databases (for introduced and threatened species) have been used. Experts also provided estimates of the number of known species not yet in the major databases. For only some groups could we obtain an (expert opinion) estimate of undiscovered species. The databases provide patchy information about endemism, levels of threat, and introductions. We conclude that there are about 33,000 marine species (mainly animals) in the major databases, of which 130 are introduced, 58 listed as threatened and an unknown percentage endemic. An estimated 17,000 more named species are either known from the Australian EEZ but not in the present databases, or potentially occur there. It is crudely estimated that there may be as many as 250,000 species (known and yet to be discovered) in the Australian EEZ. For 17 higher taxa, there is sufficient detail for subdivision by Large Marine Domains, for comparison with other National and Regional Implementation Committees of the Census of Marine Life. Taxonomic expertise in Australia is unevenly distributed across taxa, and declining. Comments are given briefly on biodiversity management measures in Australia, including but not limited to marine protected areas.

AB The rapid expansion of the world's urban population is a major driver of contemporary landscape change and ecosystem modification. Urbanisation destroys, degrades and fragments native ecosystems, replacing them with a heterogeneous matrix of urban development, parks, roads, and isolated remnant fragments of varying size and quality. This presents a major challenge for biodiversity conservation within urban areas. To make spatially explicit decisions about urban biodiversity conservation actions, urban planners and managers need to be able to separate the relative influence of landscape composition and configuration from patch and local (site)-scale variables for a range of fauna species. We address this problem using a hierarchical landscape approach for native, terrestrial reptiles and small mammals living in a fragmented semi-urban landscape of Brisbane, Australia. Generalised linear modelling and hierarchical partitioning analysis were applied to quantify the relative influence of landscape composition and configuration, patch size and shape, and local habitat composition and structure on the species' richness of mammal and reptile assemblages. Landscape structure (composition and configuration) and local-scale habitat structure variables were found to be most important for influencing reptile and mammal assemblages, although the relative importance of specific variables differed between reptile and mammal assemblages. These findings highlight the importance of considering landscape composition and configuration in addition to local habitat elements when planning and/or managing for the conservation of native, terrestrial fauna diversity in urban landscapes.

AB Studies examining how wildlife populations perceive and respond to habitat are common, and many attempt to understand how the quality of available habitats influences population processes such as survival and recruitment. Traditional methods to estimate habitat quality (e.g. population density) have not led to great advancement in our understanding of relationships between habitat and fitness in recent years. Metrics from the discipline of conservation physiology could help researchers to address these difficulties and to meet the challenges that habitat alteration poses to biodiversity. Incorporating physiological metrics that relate energetics or environmental stress to habitats may be powerful measures of habitat quality. By quantifying field metabolic rates, body condition, or concentrations of stress hormones in individual organisms, researchers may identify mechanisms associated with habitat that underlie observed patterns in vital rates (survival and fecundity). Physiological metrics offer useful tools that may identify mechanisms of habitat quality and detect the causes of declines in biodiversity. However, integration among physiologists, ecologists and conservation biologists will require new partnerships and approaches to respond to complex ecological issues.

AB Females that are socially bonded to a single male, either in a social monogamy or in a social polygyny, are often sexually polyandrous. Extrapair copulations (EPC) have often been suggested or rejected, on both empirical and theoretical grounds, as an important mechanism that enables females to avoid fertility risks in case their socially bonded male is infertile. Here, we explore this possibility in two steps. First, we present a mathematical model that assumes that females have no precopulatory information about male fertility, and shows that a female EPC strategy increases female reproductive success only if certain specific conditions are upheld in the nature of male infertility. In particular, these conditions require both (i) that fertile sperm precedence (FSP) is absent or incomplete within ejaculates of the same male (i.e. that an infertile male is, at least partly, truly infertile), and (ii) the existence of FSP among ejaculates of different males (such that infertile spermatozoa of the infertile male are at a disadvantage when competing against spermatozoa of a fertile male). Second, to evaluate their potential role in the evolution of female EPC, we review the abundance and FSP patterns of the different male infertility types. The conclusion is drawn that some common infertility types, such as poor sperm count or motility, contribute to the evolution of female EPC, whereas other common infertility types, such as sperm depletion or allocation in a social monogamy (but not in a social polygyny), and in particular male driven polyspermy, do not. Also, a deeper look at the arms race between sperm fertilization efficiency and female barriers to sperm may answer the non-trivial question: "why are some types of infertility so common?".

AB The Indo-West Pacific (IWP), from South Africa in the western Indian Ocean to the western Pacific Ocean, contains some of the most biologically diverse marine habitats on earth, including the greatest biodiversity of chondrichthyan fishes. The region encompasses various densities of human habitation leading to contrasts in the levels of exploitation experienced by chondrichthyans, which are targeted for local consumption and export. The demersal chondrichthyan, the zebra shark, Stegostoma fasciatum, is endemic to the IWP and has two current regional International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List classifications that reflect differing levels of exploitation: 'Least Concern' and 'Vulnerable'. In this study, we employed mitochondrial ND4 sequence data and 13 microsatellite loci to investigate the population genetic structure of 180 zebra sharks from 13 locations throughout the IWP to test the concordance of IUCN zones with demographic units that have conservation value. Mitochondrial and microsatellite data sets from samples collected throughout northern Australia and Southeast Asia concord with the regional IUCN classifications. However, we found evidence of genetic subdivision within these regions, including subdivision between locations connected by habitat suitable for migration. Furthermore, parametric F-ST analyses and Bayesian clustering analyses indicated that the primary genetic break within the IWP is not represented by the IUCN classifications but rather is congruent with the Indonesian throughflow current. Our findings indicate that recruitment to areas of high exploitation from nearby healthy populations in zebra sharks is likely to be minimal, and that severe localized depletions are predicted to occur in zebra shark populations throughout the IWP region.

AB Headwater streams represent the key sites of nutrient retention, but little is known about temporal variation in this important process. We used monthly measurements over 2 years to examine variation in retention of soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) and ammonium (NH4+) in two Mediterranean headwater streams with contrasting hydrological regimes (that is, perennial versus intermittent). Differences in retention between streams were more evident for NH4+, likely due to strong differences in the potential for nitrogen limitation. In both streams, nutrient-retention efficiency was negatively influenced by abrupt discharge changes, whereas gradual seasonal changes in SRP demand were partially controlled by riparian vegetation dynamics through changes in organic matter and light availability. Nutrient concentrations were below saturation in the two streams; however, SRP demand increased relative to NH4+ demand in the intermittent stream as the potential for phosphorus limitation increased (that is, higher dissolved inorganic nitrogen:SRP ratio). Unexpectedly, variability in nutrient retention was not greater in the intermittent stream, suggesting high resilience of biological communities responsible for nutrient uptake. Within-stream variability of all retention metrics, however, increased with increasing time scale. A review of studies addressing temporal variation of nutrient retention at different time scales supports this finding, indicating increasing variability of nutrient retention with concomitant increases in the variability of environmental factors from the diurnal to the inter-annual scale. Overall, this study emphasizes the significance of local climate conditions in regulating nutrient retention and points to potential effects of changes in land use and climate regimes on the functioning of stream ecosystems.

AB Global climate change is expected to shift species ranges polewards, with a risk of range contractions and population declines of especially high-Arctic species. We built species distribution models for Svalbard-nesting pink-footed geese to relate their occurrence to environmental and climatic variables, and used the models to predict their distribution under a warmer climate scenario. The most parsimonious model included mean May temperature, the number of frost-free months and the proportion of moist and wet moss-dominated vegetation in the area. The two climate variables are indicators for whether geese can physiologically fulfil the breeding cycle or not and the moss vegetation is an indicator of suitable feeding conditions. Projections of the distribution to warmer climate scenarios propose a large north- and eastward expansion of the potential breeding range on Svalbard even at modest temperature increases (1 and 2 degrees C increase in summer temperature, respectively). Contrary to recent suggestions regarding future distributions of Arctic wildlife, we predict that warming may lead to a further growth in population size of, at least some, Arctic breeding geese.

AB Centaurea maculosa, an invasive North American plant species, shows a high degree of tolerance to the root-boring biocontrol herbivore, Agapeta zoegana. For example, infested individuals of C. maculosa often exhibit more rigorous growth and reproduction compared with their non-infested counterparts. Compensatory responses to aboveground herbivores often involve increases in leaf area and/or photosynthetic capacity, but considerably less is known about root system compensatory responses to belowground herbivory. We used a N-15 labeling approach to evaluate whether compensatory adjustments in N acquisition via changes in root morphology and/or physiological uptake capacity could explain the ability of C. maculosa to tolerate root herbivory. Root herbivory reduced whole plant N uptake by more than 30% and root uptake capacity by about 50%. Despite a marked reduction in N procurement, herbivory did not affect total biomass or shoot N status. Infested plants maintained shoot N status by shifting more of the acquired N from the root to the shoot. To our knowledge, shifting N allocation away from a root herbivore has not been reported and provides a plausible mechanism for the host plant to overcome an otherwise devastating effect of a root herbivore-induced N deficit.

AB Question: Can the distribution and abundance of Vaccinium myrtillus be reasonably predicted with soil nutritional and climatic factors?
   Location: Forests of France.
   Methods: We used Braun-Blanquet abundance/dominance information for Vaccinium myrtillus on 2905 forest sites extracted from the phyto-ecological database EcoPlant, to characterize the species ecological response to climatic and edaphic factors and to predict its cover/abundance at the national scale. The link between cover/abundance of the species and climatic (65 monthly and annual predictors concerning temperature, precipitation, radiation, potential evapotranspiration, water balance) and edaphic (two predictors: soil pH and C:N ratio) factors was investigated with proportional odds models. We evaluated the quality of our model with 9830 independent releves extracted from Sophy, a large phytosociological database for France.
   Results: In France, Vaccinium myrtillus is at the southern limit of its European geographic range and three environmental factors (mean annual temperature, soil pH and C:N ratio) allow prediction of its distribution and abundance in forests with high success rates. The species reveals a preference for colder sites (especially mountains) and nutritionally poor soils (low pH and high C:N ratio). A predictive map of its geographic range reveals that the main potential habitats are mountains and northwestern France. The potential habitats with maximal expected abundance are the Vosges and the Massif central mountains. which are both acidic mountains.
   Conclusions: Complete niche models including climate and soil nutritional conditions allow an improvement of the spatial prediction of plant species abundance at a broad scale. The use of soil nutritional variables in distribution models further leads to an improvement in the prediction of plant species habitats within their aeographical range.

AB Landscape fragmentation is increasingly considered an important environmental indicator in the fields of sustainable land use and biodiversity. To set goals for future development and to plan appropriate measures, suitable empirical data on the degree of landscape fragmentation are needed to identify trends and compare different regions. However, there is still a significant lack of data on landscape fragmentation as an indicator, despite the substantial scientific literature on this topic, likely because of confusion over the definition of "fragmentation," questions associated with scale and data issues, and lack of general agreement on a fragmentation measure. This study presents a state-wide quantitative analysis of landscape fragmentation in Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany, by means of the " effective mesh size" (m(eff)), which characterizes the anthropogenic penetration of landscapes from a geometric point of view and is based on the probability that two randomly chosen points in a landscape are connected, i.e., not separated by barriers such as roads, railroads, or urban areas. Baden-Wurttemberg is fragmented to a far greater extent than indicated by previous studies. The m(eff) has decreased by 40% since 1930. This development is strongly related to the growing number of inhabitants, the increased use of motorized vehicles, and the hierarchical regional planning system based on the central place theory. To illustrate the suitability of the meff method for environmental monitoring, as a planning instrument and as an assessment instrument for impact assessment studies, we explored several variations of applying the method with regard to choice of fragmenting elements, consideration of noise bands, spatial differentiation (e. g., administrative districts vs. ecoregions), and way of dealing with patches at the boundaries of the reporting units. Depending on the objectives of the investigation (e. g., recreational quality vs. suitability for wildlife habitat), different variations may be most appropriate. The insights and quantitative results from Baden-Wurttemberg provide a yardstick for analyzing and assessing landscape fragmentation in other countries.

AB In the present study, we analysed 18 red deer specimens from a small (N = 50) and isolated population in Schleswig-Holstein, northern Germany, with respect to variability at nine polymorphic microsatellite loci and 439 bp of the mitochondrial DNA control region. Several cases of brachygnathy (shortened lower jaw), commonly associated with inbreeding depression, have been recorded in the population. Genetic variability was very low compared with other European red deer populations including the neighbouring population from which the population under study was derived some 130 years ago. The effective population size was estimated to be seven individuals corresponding to an increase in inbreeding (or a loss of heterozygosity) of 7% each generation. This value is seven times higher than the theoretical threshold level up to which natural selection is believed to counteract the fixation of deleterious alleles in the gene pool. As a consequence, the population urgently needs genetic input from other populations to overcome the negative effects of random drift and inbreeding.

AB Inundation marks the shift from a terrestrial ecosystem to an aquatic ecosystem in ephemeral rivers. The forms and rates of responses by aquatic invertebrates and sediment microbes to inundation depend on desiccation resistance during preceding dry periods. We assessed invertebrate and microbial responses to inundation over a range of preceding dry periods in an ephemeral reach of the Selwyn River, New Zealand. Microbial response variables were dissolved oxygen consumption and non-specific esterase activity. Sampling sites along the reach had been continuously dry for 1-592 d prior to sample collection. The onset of flow simulated by an experimental inundation led to the appearance of aquatic invertebrates in all samples, but the assemblages varied with the length of the preceding dry period. Taxon richness decreased linearly with dry period length while density decreased exponentially. These patterns indicate that a large number of individuals from desiccation-sensitive taxa were eliminated soon after flow ceased, and a low-density assemblage composed of a small number of desiccation-resistant taxa persisted during prolonged dry periods. As with invertebrate density, sediment respiration and nonspecific esterase activity decreased with length of dry period, and were characterized by exponential decay functions. The results of the inundation experiments suggest that a temporal ecotone exists for about one week after the disappearance of flowing water, and before the terrestrial system stabilizes.

AB We measured annual net nitrogen (N) mineralization, nitrification, and amino acid production in situ across a primary successional sequence in interior Alaska, USA. Net N mineralization per gram dry soil increased across the successional sequence, but with a sharp decline in the oldest stage (black spruce). Net N mineralization expressed per gram soil organic matter exhibited the opposite pattern, suggesting that soil organic matter quality decreases significantly across succession. Net N mineralization rates during the growing season from green-up (early May) through freeze-up (late September-early October) accounted for approximately 60% of the annual inorganic N flux, whereas the remaining N was released during the apparent dormant season. Nitrogen release during winter occurred primarily during October-January with only negligible N mineralization during early spring in stands of willow, alder, balsam poplar and white spruce. By contrast, black spruce stands exhibited substantial mineralization after snow melt during early spring. The high rates of N mineralization in late autumn through early winter coincide with high turnover of fine root biomass in these stands, suggesting that labile substrate production, rather than temperature, is a major controlling factor over N release in these ecosystems. We suggest that the convention of restricting measurements of soil processes to the growing season greatly underestimate annual flux rates of inorganic nitrogen in these high-latitude ecosystems.

AB Molecular phylogeny of soricid shrews (Soricidae, Eulipotyphla, Mammalia) based on 1140 bp mitochondrial cytochrome b gene (cytb) sequences was inferred by the maximum likelihood (ML) method. All 13 genera of extant Soricinae and two genera of Crocidurinae were included in the analyses. Anourosorex was phylogenetically distant from the main groupings within Soricinae and Crocidurinae in the ML tree. Thus, it could not be determined to which subfamily Anourosorex should be assigned: Soricinae, Crocidurinae or a new subfamily. Soricinae (excluding Anourosorex) should be divided into four tribes: Neomyini, Notiosoricini, Soricini and Blarinini. However, monophyly of Blarinini was not robust in the present data set. Also, branching orders among tribes of Soricinae and those among genera of Neomyini could not be determined because of insufficient phylogenetic information of the cytb sequences. For water shrews of Neomyini (Chimarrogale, Nectogale and Neomys), monophyly of Neomys and the Chimarrogale-Nectogale group could not be verified, which implies the possibility of multiple origins for the semi-aquatic mode of living among taxa within Neomyini. Episoriculus may contain several separate genera. Blarinella was included in Blarinini not Soricini, based on the cytb sequences, but the confidence level was rather low; hence more phylogenetic information is needed to determine its phylogenetic position. Furthermore, some specific problems of taxonomy of soricid shrews were clarified, for example phylogeny of local populations of Notiosorex crawfordi, Chimarrogale himalayica and Crocidura attenuata.

AB Giant Amazon river turtles, Podocnemis expansa, are indigenous to the Amazon, Orinoco, and Essequibo River basins, and are distributed across nearly the entire width of the South American continent. Although once common, their large size, high fecundity, and gregarious nesting, made P. expansa especially vulnerable to over-harvesting for eggs and meat. Populations have been severely reduced or extirpated in many areas throughout its range, and the species is now regulated under Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species. Here, we analyse data from mitochondrial DNA sequence and multiple nuclear microsatellite markers with an array of complementary analytical methods. Results show that concordance from multiple data sets and analyses can provide a strong signal of population genetic structure that can be used to guide management. The general lack of phylogeographic structure but large differences in allele and haplotype frequencies among river basins is consistent with fragmented populations and female natal-river homing. Overall, the DNA data show that P. expansa populations lack a long history of genetic differentiation, but that each major tributary currently forms a semi-isolated reproductive population and should be managed accordingly.

AB Biogeographic theory argues that consumer-prey interactions are more intense, and prey defenses better developed, at lower latitudes. Along the Atlantic Coast of the United States, low-latitude salt marsh plants are less palatable than high-latitude con-specifics. To test the hypothesis that latitudinal variation in palatability would occur in the absence of geographically different environmental cues (i.e., that differences in palatability are constitutive rather than induced by climate or herbivore damage), we grew high- and low-latitude individuals of three species of salt marsh plants from seeds (Solidago sempervirens) or rhizome cuttings (Distichlis spiccita and Spartina alterniflora) in a common-garden greenhouse environment, and compared their palatability to herbivores over time. We also quantified leaf toughness and nitrogen content over time in order to help explain results of feeding assays. High-latitude plants were always more palatable to herbivores than low-latitude conspecifics. Latitudinal variation in plant traits depended on the plant species. Toughness varied as a function of latitude for Spartina, with low-latitude plants being consistently tougher than high-latitude conspecifics. For all generations of Spartina, and for seed-propagated Solidago, high-latitude plants had a higher nitrogen content than low-latitude conspecifics. The fact that latitudinal differences in palatability and traits of salt marsh plants persisted in a common-garden environment suggests that this variation is constitutive, and likely under genetic control, rather than a plastic response to environmental cues. These results are consistent with the theory that latitudinal differences in herbivory have selected for geographical variation in plant palatability, although we cannot rule out other selective forces that may also vary across latitude.

AB Some phosphate rocks (PR) contain high concentrations of uranium (U), which are potentially toxic via accumulation in soils and food chains, and plant uptake of U is likely to be influenced by characteristics of roots and associated microorganisms. The relative importance of root hairs and mycorrhiza in U uptake from PR was studied using a root hairless barley (Hordeum vulgare) mutant (Brb) and its wild type (WT).
   Both plant genotypes were grown in pots with Glomus intraradices BEG 87, or in the absence of mycorrhiza, and three P treatments were included: nil P, 2% (w/w) PR and 50 mg KH2PO4-P kg(-1) soil.
   Mycorrhiza markedly increased d. wts and P contents of Brb amended with nil P or PR, but generally depressed d. wts of WT plants, irrespective of P amendments. Mycorrhiza had contrasting effects on U contents in roots and shoots, in particular in Brb where mycorrhiza increased root U concentrations but decreased U translocation from roots to shoots.
   The experiment supports our understanding of arbuscular mycorrhiza as being multifunctional by not only improving the utilization of PR by the host plant but also by contributing to the phytostabilization of uranium.

AB The Iberian Peninsula comprises two distinct biogeographic areas: a temperate Atlantic Eurosiberian (north) and a Mediterranean (centre and south), and they provide very different biotopes, landscapes and prey for carnivores. One example is an abundance of the wild rabbit Orytolagus cuniculus in the Mediterranean zone, which contrasts with the Eurosiberian zone, where the rabbit is scarce. The feeding resource partitioning among four sympatric predators (red fox Vulpes vulpes, wild cat Felis silvestris, genet Genetta genetta and stone marten Martes foina) was analysed in the Peneda-Geres National Park (north-west Portugal), located in the Eurosiberian region. Data on the spatial distribution of three important prey species (Apodemus sylvaticus, Microtus lusitanicus and Talpa occidentalis) were also collected to investigate their possible relationships with the feeding habits of each predator. Rodents are the staple prey for this guild of carnivores. Predators are able to supplement their diets with one or two secondary prey types: rabbits and arthropods by the largest carnivores (the red fox and the wild cat); insectivores by the small predators (the genet and the stone marten). These results contrast with the characteristic Mediterranean predator-prey features, where rabbits are the main support of carnivore communities. The feeding resource partitioning revealed a complex structure characterized by a dynamic niche differentiation and overlap, according to a seasonal pattern. To explain this pattern of resource exploitation two hypotheses are discussed in the light of the body size of predators and their use of space.

AB Selectivity-size spectra, clearance and ingestion rates and assimilation efficiencies of Acartia clausi (Copepoda), Penilia avirostris (Cladocera) and Doliolum denticulatum (Doliolida) from Blanes Bay (Catalan Sea, NW Mediterranean) were evaluated in grazing experiments over a wide range of food concentrations (0.02-8.8 mm(3) L-1 plankton assemblages from Blanes Bay, grown in mesocosms at different nutrient levels). Acartia clausi reached the highest grazing coefficients for large algae >70 mum (longest linear extension), P. avirostris for intermediate food sizes between 15 and 70 mum, and D. denticulatum for small sizes from 2.5 to 15 mum. Penilia avirostris and D. denticulatum acted as passive filter-feeders. Acartia clausi gave some evidence for a supplementary raptorial feeding mode. Effective food concentration (EFC) decreased linearly with increasing nutrient enrichment for D. denticulatum and followed domed curves for A. clausi and for P. avirostris with maximum values at intermediate and high enrichment levels, respectively. Clearance rates of crustacean species showed curvilinear responses with narrow modal ranges to increasing food concentration. Clearance rates of D. denticulatum increased abruptly and levelled into a plateau at low food concentrations. Mean clearance rates were 13.9, 25.5 and 64.1 mL ind.(-1) day(-1), respectively. No clearance could be detected for A. clausi at food concentrations <0.1 mm(3) L-1 and for P. avirostris at food concentrations less than or equal to0.02 mm(3) L-1. Ingestion rates indicate a rectilinear functional response for A. clausi and for P. avirostris and showed a sigmoidal curve for D. denticulatum. Mean ingestion rates were 1.3, 2.8 and 7.7 mug C mug C-ind.(-1) day(-1), respectively. Conversion of ingested carbon to tissue was 30-80% for the investigated crustaceans and 20-50% for doliolids. Food niche calculations suggest that food niche separation may explain the coexistence of the three species in summer in Blanes Bay.

AB The aim of the present study was to quantify the contribution of AMF to phosphorus ( P) nutrition of the host plant when the P availability in the soil was limited by drought. To investigate the potential of AMF hyphae in taking up P from dry soil, mycorrhizal [+M] and nonmycorrhizal [-M] Sorghum bicolor L. plants were grown in a vertical split root system that consisted of two compartments placed upon one the other. The upper compartment was filled with well fertilised soil and the plant roots were allowed to grow into the lower compartment through a perforated bottom. The lower compartment was filled with an expanded clay substrate and nutrient solution, to supply the plants with water and all nutrients except P. The soil in the upper compartments was either dried [-W] or kept moist [+W] during a period of four weeks before harvest.
   The total plant P content did not differ significantly between the[-M] and the [+ M] plants within the [+ W] treatment. In contrast, the P content of the [+ M] plants was almost twice as high as the [-M] plants when the soil in the upper compartment was dried. The concentrations of all elements except P in plant shoot tissue were sufficient for adequate plant growth. Phosphorus concentrations in the shoots of [- M/-W] plants indicated P deficiency, and these plants also had significantly lower dry matter and transpiration compared to the plants in all other treatments.
   From the results of the present experiment it can be concluded that mycorrhizal colonisation seems to be particularly benefical to P uptake from dry soil.

AB Invasive exotic plants have been identified as one of the major threats to ecosystem function and biodiversity. This study examined the distribution and abundance (cover and frequency) of invasive plants in natural habitats of the Quinebaug Highlands forest block ( 13,760 ha) of northern Connecticut and southern Massachusetts in relation to current and historical land use and site conditions. Multiple regression and GIS analyses were used to identify areas of high infestation and factors most useful in predicting invasions. Celastrus orbiculatus, Rosa multiflora, and Berberis thunbergii were the most frequent invasives. Past land use was the strongest predictor of invasive cover (r(2) = 0.219) and richness (r(2) = 0.303; p < 0.001 both regressions). Current land development and physical soil characteristics were also strongly correlated. These results add to our understanding of factors promoting plant invasions. Because invasive species control in natural areas is time- and resource-intensive, this information may enhance conservation efforts by increasing efficiency in predicting and managing biological invasions.

AB Silver birch (Betula pendula Roth), pedunculate oak (Quercus robur L.) and beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) can regenerate successfully under a canopy of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.). Shading reduces plant growth and modifies plant form, two related aspects. This study focuses on the effects of shading on root-shoot relations of these species. Saplings were grown for 2 years under full light (light availability of 100%) and shaded conditions (light availability of 30%) and then harvested and their root system excavated. Shading had no effect on the biomass distribution within the root system. Shading reduced the root-shoot ratio of the species studied. Only for silver birch the fine root biomass-leaf biomass ratio decreased by shading, indicating a reduced partitioning to the fine roots in comparison to the leaves. Shading reduced the fine root length-leaf area ratio of the three species studied. However the magnitude of reduction differed between the species; small in pedunculate oak, intermediate in beech and large in silver birch. For pedunculate oak and beech this effect must be primarily attributed to an increase in specific leaf area under shaded conditions, while for silver birch this effect can be attributed to both the morphological adjustment in the leaves and the increased partitioning to the leaves. As the capacity of leaves and fine roots to acquire resources has to balance we postulate that under the experimental conditions an increase the efficiency of carbon uptake relative to the efficiency of nutrient uptake is the dominant acclimation of pedunculate oak. The response of silver birch indicates that the dominant acclimation to shading is based on a shift in a biomass partitioning between the leaves and the fine roots. Beech holds an intermediate position, as there is evidence for an increase in the efficiency of carbon uptake relative to the efficiency of nutrient uptake and an increase of leaf area relative to fine root length.

AB In relation to the drought-prone and nutrient-poor habitat, vascular epiphytes are routinely referred to as inherently slow-growing plants, although actual evidence is rare. To test this notion we measured in situ growth of the understorey orchid Aspasia principissa and the tank bromeliad Vriesea sanguinolenta, and, for the latter species, also the growth under favourable conditions in the greenhouse. Using growth analysis we show: (1) that in an intraspecific comparison, small to intermediate individuals yield the highest relative,growth rates (RGR) in situ A. principissa: 1.6 10(-3) d(-1); V. sanguinolenta: 3.3 10(-3) d(-1); (2) that the bromeliad reaches maximum size after ca. 15 yr, while the orchid needs at least 20 yr; and (3) small V. sanguinolenta plants exhibit a highly plastic growth response to favourable conditions in the greenhouse, reaching an almost 10-fold increase in RGR. In spite of a substantial increase in growth under more favourable conditions, our results are consistent with the notion that epiphytes are inherently slow growing organisms.

AB Coralliophilid gastropods include a large number of described species, grouped in at least seven to 10 'genera according to their shell morphology. They are considered closely related to Muricidae and ranked as a family on its own or as a subfamily of muricids. Their phylogenetic position and relationships are still not defined. The little anatomical work so far done on this group seems to indicate a relatively high level of homogeneity. at least in the alimentary system. Then is a need for an independent phylogenetic framework to understand their position and relationship within the muricoideans, and their internal systematics and phylogeny. We have addressed this problem by means of parsimony analysis of 609 aligned positions of the sequences coding for the 12S rDNA. Four coralliophilid sequences representing the same number of commonly recognized lineages (Babelomurex Latiaxis, Coralliophila, Galeropsis = Quoyula) were analysed, along with three sequences of muricoid genera (Stramonita. Phyllonotus. Nucella) representing as many subfamilies of Muricidae, plus the sequence of the buccinoidean Fasciolaria as outgroup. Maximum parsimony and neighbour-joining analysis of the dataset, with increasing weighing of transversions versus transitions, yielded similar topologies. Two major outcomes resulted from the analyses: first, the coralliophilid sequences included herein are always monophyletic. with very high bootstrap support in all analyses. This is in agreement with the few anatomical data gathered so far that suggest coralliophilids are relatively homogeneous. Secondly. the sister-group of the coralliophilids among the analysed sequences is represented by Stramonita, with high bootstrap support in all analyses. This is in a good agreement with previous molecular analyses and with the morphological evidence that Rapaninae are the closest sister group of coralliophilids. According to the present results. the rank of the coralliophilids should be the same as Rapaninae, therefore a subfamilial status (Coralliophilinae) seems reasonable.

AB The characteristics of high population and species biodiversity, taken together with the major anthropogenic threats arising from exploitation, introductions and habitat alterations, have ensured that fishes have received major attention from molecular biologists in the study of wild populations. Foremost among the various challenges has been the development of techniques to estimate population discreteness and associated patterns of dispersal and gene flow, so-called stock structure analysis. Here, we review some recent developments in molecular technology, especially microsatellite analysis, and consider critically how such markers can be employed to estimate genetic differentiation in species exhibiting high mobility in open waters. Comparisons are made between microsatellites and other genetic markers (protein and DNA) in their ability to detect population structuring. Particular emphasis is placed on the need to design sampling programmes that rake account of aspects of the biology of the species under study, and the scale and nature of sample collection. Recent novel applications of PCR-based technology in the analysis of population structure are considered including the detection of microgeographic differentiation, the analysis of historical fish populations using recovered DNA, and the molecular characterization of allelic variants among populations in relation to function.

AB Remobilization of P from vegetative tissues can be an important source of grain P in common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.). Yet, data on the extent of remobilization of P from roots is scarce. We measured P remobilization from roots and leaves and examined the influence of P nutrition on remobilization patterns and tissue longevity. A split-root system was used to expose a portion of the root system (compartment roots) to low-P treatments independently from those imposed on the main root system. Phosphorus content of retained leaves, abscised leaves, stems, pods, seeds, and roots were observed over time. Leaf remobilization supplied over half of the pod plus seed P. Flux analysis suggested that leaf remobilization occurred earlier in low-P than it did in high-P plants. Root P content of compartment roots did not decrease with ontogeny. We compared remobilization patterns of root P in low-P and high-P plants in a short-term experiment using P-32 applied to roots grown in either low-P or high-P compartments. Compartment roots retained over 80% of absorbed P-32 almost all cases. The exception was roots of high-P plants grown in a high-P compartment, which retained only 20% of absorbed P-32. Together these results indicate common bean roots retain P when soil P levels are low. This behavior is in contrast to that of leaves and stems which remobilize P to the grain at both low and high levels of soil P fertility.

AB Diurnal heliotropic leaf movements, photosynthetic gas exchange, and the ratio of variable fluorescence to maximum fluorescence (Fv/Fm) of unrestrained and horizontally restrained leaves from soybean (Glycine max cv. Cumberland) plants grown in two different water and two different nitrogen treatments were measured. Leaves of plants grown in low water or low nitrogen availability treatments displayed more pronounced diaheliotropism (solar tracking) in the afternoon and a longer period of paraheliotropism (light avoiding) at midday relative to those of well-watered, high-nitrogen-grown plants. Photosaturated photosynthetic rates and the photon flux required to saturate photosynthesis were reduced by water stress and nitrogen deficiency. Compared to horizontal leaves, irradiance on orienting leaves was nearer to the breakpoint of the photosynthetic light response curve, where photosynthesis is co-limited by ribulose biphosphate regeneration and carboxylation. This would increase the carbon return on investments of nitrogen into photosynthesis. A positive linear relationship between Fv/Fm and quantum yield of photosynthesis was measured. Leaves of low-nitrogen-grown plants had earlier and more prolonged reductions in Fv/Fm at midday compared to leaves of high nitrogen grown plants of the same water treatment. Within the same water and nitrogen treatment, horizontally restrained leaves had lower midday Fv/Fm in relation to orienting leaves. Nitrogen deficiency and water stress enhanced this difference such that horizontally restrained leaves of low water and low nitrogen grown plants had earlier and longer midday depressions in Fv/Fm.

AB Climate change and other anthropogenic drivers of biodiversity change are unequally distributed across the world. Overlap in the distributions of different drivers have important implications for biodiversity change attribution and the potential for interactive effects. However, the spatial relationships among different drivers and whether they differ between the terrestrial and marine realm has yet to be examined. We compiled global gridded datasets on climate change, land-use, resource exploitation, pollution, alien species potential and human population density. We used multivariate statistics to examine the spatial relationships among the drivers and to characterize the typical combinations of drivers experienced by different regions of the world. We found stronger positive correlations among drivers in the terrestrial than in the marine realm, leading to areas with high intensities of multiple drivers on land. Climate change tended to be negatively correlated with other drivers in the terrestrial realm (e.g. in the tundra and boreal forest with high climate change but low human use and pollution), whereas the opposite was true in the marine realm (e.g. in the Indo-Pacific with high climate change and high fishing). We show that different regions of the world can be defined by Anthropogenic Threat Complexes (ATCs), distinguished by different sets of drivers with varying intensities. We identify 11 ATCs that can be used to test hypotheses about patterns of biodiversity and ecosystem change, especially about the joint effects of multiple drivers. Our global analysis highlights the broad conservation priorities needed to mitigate the impacts of anthropogenic change, with different priorities emerging on land and in the ocean, and in different parts of the world.
   Abstrakt
   Der Klimawandel und andere anthropogene Faktoren, die die biologische Vielfalt verandern, betreffen nicht alle Teile der Erde in gleicher Weise. Wahrend unsere Kenntnisse zu jedem einzelnen Gefahrdungsfaktor standig wachsen, ist unser Verstandnis zu den raumlichen Beziehungen zwischen den verschiedenen Faktoren und ihr Zusammenwirken noch sehr mangelhaft. Das betrifft z.B. auch die Unterschiede zwischen terrestrischen und marinen Lebensraumen, die sehr unterschiedlichen Bedrohungen ausgesetzt sein konnen, selbst wenn sie eng benachbart sind. In der vorliegenden Studie haben wir globale Datensatze uber Klimawandel, Landnutzung, Ressourcenausbeutung, Umweltverschmutzung, biologische Invasionen und Bevolkerungsdichte zusammengestellt. Mit Hilfe multivariater Statistiken haben wir die raumlichen Beziehungen zwischen diesen Ursachen des globalen Biodiversitatswandels und deren Kombinationen untersucht, um deren Einfluss auf verschiedene Regionen der Welt zu charakterisieren. Insbesondere in den terrestrischen Regionen wirken die genannten Gefahrdungsfaktoren haufig in der gleichen Richtung, vor allem solche, die zum Teil besonders hohe Belastungen darstellen. Regionen mit starker ausgepragtem Klimawandel sind tendenziell solche Gebiete, in denen die Gefahrdung durch andere Faktoren eher geringer ist, wie z.B. in der Tundra und im borealen Nadelwald, die stark vom Klimawandel, aber weniger von hoher Nutzungsintensitat und Verschmutzung betroffen sind. Dagegen treten in den Meeresregionen gegenteilige Muster auf, wo z.B. im Indopazifik ein sehr ausgepragter Klimawandel einer hoher Ressourcenausbeutung durch Fischerei zusammenfallt. Die Regionen der Welt lassen sich in Klassen unterschiedlicher Interaktionen und Intensitaten dieser anthropogenen Gefahrungsfaktoren unterteilen. Diese insgesamt 11 verschiedene Faktorenklassen konnen nun dazu verwendet werden, Auswirkungen auf Biodiversitat zu untersuchen und die Gefahrdungs-Hotspots zu identifizieren. Diese Hotspots sind diejenigen gro ss raumigen Meeres- und Festlandsregionen, in denen prioritar Naturschutzma ss nahmen angewendet werden mussen, um den Auswirkungen des anthropogenen Biodiversitatswandels entgegenzutreten.

AB A mechanistic understanding of plant photosynthetic response is needed to reliably predict changes in terrestrial carbon (C) gain under conditions of chronically elevated atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition. Here, using 2,683 observations from 240 journal articles, we conducted a global meta-analysis to reveal effects of N addition on 14 photosynthesis-related traits and affecting moderators. We found that across 320 terrestrial plant species, leaf N was enhanced comparably on mass basis (N-mass, +18.4%) and area basis (N-area, +14.3%), with no changes in specific leaf area or leaf mass per area. Total leaf area (TLA) was increased significantly, as indicated by the increases in total leaf biomass (+46.5%), leaf area per plant (+29.7%), and leaf area index (LAI, +24.4%). To a lesser extent than for TLA, N addition significantly enhanced leaf photosynthetic rate per area (A(area), +12.6%), stomatal conductance (g(s), +7.5%), and transpiration rate (E, +10.5%). The responses of A(area) were positively related with that of g(s), with no changes in instantaneous water-use efficiency and only slight increases in long-term water-use efficiency (+2.5%) inferred from C-13 composition. The responses of traits depended on biological, experimental, and environmental moderators. As experimental duration and N load increased, the responses of LAI and A(area) diminished while that of E increased significantly. The observed patterns of increases in both TLA and E indicate that N deposition will increase the amount of water used by plants. Taken together, N deposition will enhance gross photosynthetic C gain of the terrestrial plants while increasing their water loss to the atmosphere, but the effects on C gain might diminish over time and that on plant water use would be amplified if N deposition persists.

AB Dispersal is a central process in ecology and evolution. At the individual level, the three stages of the dispersal process (i.e., emigration, transience and immigration) are affected by complex interactions between phenotypes and environmental factors. Condition- and context-dependent dispersal have far-reaching consequences, both for the demography and the genetic structuring of natural populations and for adaptive processes. From an applied point of view, dispersal also deeply affects the spatial dynamics of populations and their ability to respond to land-use changes, habitat degradation and climate change. For these reasons, dispersal has received considerable attention from ecologists and evolutionary biologists. Demographic and genetic methods allow quantifying non-effective (i.e., followed or not by a successful reproduction) and effective (i.e., with a successful reproduction) dispersal and to investigate how individual and environmental factors affect the different stages of the dispersal process. Over the past decade, demographic and genetic methods designed to quantify dispersal have rapidly evolved but interactions between researchers from the two fields are limited. We here review recent developments in both demographic and genetic methods to study dispersal in wild animal populations. We present their strengths and limits, as well as their applicability depending on study objectives and population characteristics. We propose a unified framework allowing researchers to combine methods and select the more suitable tools to address a broad range of important topics about the ecology and evolution of dispersal and its consequences on animal population dynamics and genetics.

AB Revegetation of degraded lands has a profound impact on the maintenance and stability of ecosystemprocesses. However, the impacts of this land use change on functional diversity of soil microbial communities are poorly understood. Here, using 16S rRNA gene amplicon and shotgun metagenomic sequencing, we compared the taxonomic and functional communities of soil microbiome, and analyzed the effects of plant diversity and soil chemical properties, in a chronosequence of restored ex-farmland that had been naturally revegetated to grassland over periods of 5, 15 and 30 years with adjacent farmland, on the Loess Plateau, China. We found that microbial taxonomic diversity was positively correlated with plant diversity and was higher in the revegetated sites. Functional diversity increased significantly in the oldest grassland. Actinobacteria, commonly considered a copiotrophic phylum, was more abundant in the revegetated sites, while Acidobacteria, an oligotrophic phylum, was more abundant in farmland. Furthermore, the structure of taxonomic and functional communities was significantly different between revegetated sites and farmland, and organic matter was the best environmental predictor in determining these microbial communities. Compared with the farmland, revegetation increased the proportion of genes associated with energy metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism and xenobiotics biodegradation and metabolism. Notably, the higher proportion of carbohydrate degradation gene subfamilies in the revegetated sites indicated higher levels of soil nutrient cycling. These results elucidate the significant shifts in below ground microbial taxonomic and functional diversity following vegetation restoration and have implications for ecological restoration programs in arid and semi-arid ecosystems.

AB Indonesia's marine ecosystems form a fundamental part of the world's natural heritage, representing a global maxima of marine biodiversity and supporting the world's second largest production of seafood. Seagrasses are a key part of that support. In the absence of empirical data we present evidence from expert opinions as to the state of Indonesia's seagrass ecosystems, their support for ecosystem services, with a focus on fisheries, and the damaging activities that threaten their existence. We further draw on expert opinion to elicit potential solutions to prevent further loss. Seagrasses and the ecosystemservices they support across the Indonesian archipelago are in a critical state of decline. Declining seagrass health is the result of shifting environmental conditions due largely to coastal development, land reclamation, and deforestation, as well as seaweed farming, overfishing and garbage dumping. In particular, we also describe the declining state of the fisheries resources that seagrass meadows support. The perilous state of Indonesia's seagrasses will compromise their resilience to climate change and result in a loss of their high ecosystem service value. Community supported management initiatives provide one mechanism for seagrass protection. Exemplars highlight the need for increased local level autonomy for the management of marine resources, opening up opportunities for incentive type conservation schemes. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Human appropriation of water resources may induce water stress in freshwater ecosystems when ecosystem needs are not met. Intensive abstraction and regulation cause river ecosystems to shift towards non-natural flow regimes, which might have implications for their water quality, biological structure and functioning. We performed a meta-analysis of published studies to assess the potential effects of water stress on nutrients, microcontaminants, biological communities (bacteria, algae, invertebrates and fish), and ecosystem functions (organic matter breakdown, gross primary production and respiration). Despite the different nature of the flow regime changes, our meta-analysis showed significant effects of human-driven water stress, such as significant increases in algal biomass and metabolism and reduced invertebrate richness, abundance and density and organic matter decomposition. Water stress also significantly decreased phosphate concentration and increased the concentration of pharmaceutical compounds. The magnitude of significant effects was dependent on climate, rainfall regime, period of the year, river size and type of water stress. Among the different causes of water stress, flow regulation by dams produced the strongest effects, followed by water abstraction and channelization.

AB Introduction: Truck crashes contribute to a large number of injuries and fatalities. This study seeks to identify the contributing factors affecting truck crash severity using 2010 to 2016 North Dakota and Colorado crash data provided by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration. Method: To fulfill a gap of previous studies, broad considerations of company and driver characteristics, such as company size and driver's license class, along with vehicle types and crash characteristics are researched. Gradient boosting, a data mining technique, is applied to comprehensively analyze the relationship between crash severities and a set of heterogeneous risk factors. Results: Twenty five variables were tested and 22 of them are identified as significant variables contributing to injury severities, however, top 11 variables account for more than 80% of injury forecasting. The relative variable importance analysis is conducted and furthermore marginal effects of all contributing factors are also illustrated in this research. Several factors such as trucking company attributes (e.g., company size), safety inspection values, trucking company commerce status (e.g., interstate or intrastate), time of day, driver's age, first harmful events, and registration condition are found to be significantly associated with crash injury severity. Even though most of the identified contributing factors are significant for all four levels of crash severity, their relative importance and marginal effect are all different. Conclusions: For the first time, trucking company and driver characteristics are proved to have significant impact on truck crash injury severity. Some of the results in this study reinforce previous studies' conclusions. Practical applications: Findings in this study can be helpful for transportation agencies to reduce injury severity, and develop efficient strategies to improve safety.

AB Background: The ecosystems across Tibetan Plateau are changing rapidly under the influence of climate warming, which has caused substantial changes in spatial and temporal environmental patterns. Stipa purpurea, as a dominant herbsage resource in alpine steppe, has a great influence on animal husbandry in the Tibetan Plateau. Global warming has been forecasted to continue in the future (2050s, 2070s), questioning the future distribution of S. purpurea and its response to climate change. The maximum entropy (MaxEnt) modeling, due to its multiple advantages (e.g. uses presence-only data, performs well with incomplete data, and requires small sample sizes and gaps), has been used to understand species environment relationships and predict species distributions across locations that have not been sampled.
   Results: Annual mean temperature, annual precipitation, temperature seasonality, altitude, and precipitation during the driest month, significantly affected the distribution of S. purpurea. Only 0.70% of the Tibetan Plateau area included a very highly suitable habitat (habitat suitability [HS] = 0.8-1.0). Highly suitable habitat (HS = 0.6-0.8), moderately suitable habitat (HS = 0.4-0.6), and unsuitable habitat (HS = 0.2-0.4) occupied 6.20, 14.30 and 22.40% of the Tibetan Plateau area, respectively, and the majority (56.40%) of the Tibetan Plateau area constituted a highly unsuitable habitat (HS = 0-0.2). In addition, the response curves of species ecological suitability simulated by generalized additive model nearly corresponded with the response curves generated by the MaxEnt model.
   Conclusions: At a temporal scale, the habitat suitability of S. purpurea tends to increase from the 1990s to 2050s, but decline from the 2050s to 2070s. At a spatial scale, the future distribution of S. purpurea will not exhibit sweeping changes and will remain in the central and southeastern regions of the Tibetan Plateau. These results benefit the local animal husbandry and provide evidence for establishing reasonable management practices.

AB Climate change will alter both the amount and pattern of precipitation and soil water availability, which will directly affect plant growth and nutrient acquisition, and potentially, ecosystem functions like nutrient cycling and losses as well. Given their role in facilitating plant nutrient acquisition and water stress resistance, arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi may modulate the effects of changing water availability on plants and ecosystem functions. The well-characterized mycorrhizal tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) genotype 76R (referred to as MYC+) and the mutant mycorrhiza-defective tomato genotype rmc were grown in microcosms in a glasshouse experiment manipulating both the pattern and amount of water supply in unsterilized field soil. Following 4 weeks of differing water regimes, we tested how AM fungi affected plant productivity and nutrient acquisition, short-term interception of a (NH4+)-N-15 pulse, and inorganic nitrogen (N) leaching from microcosms. AM fungi enhanced plant nutrient acquisition with both lower and more variable water availability, for instance increasing plant P uptake more with a pulsed water supply compared to a regular supply and increasing shoot N concentration more when lower water amounts were applied. Although uptake of the short-term (NH4+)-N-15 pulse was higher in rmc plants, possibly due to higher N demand, AM fungi subtly modulated NO3- leaching, decreasing losses by 54% at low and high water levels in the regular water regime, with small absolute amounts of NO3- leached (<1 kg N/ha). Since this study shows that AM fungi will likely be an important moderator of plant and ecosystem responses to adverse effects of more variable precipitation, management strategies that bolster AM fungal communities may in turn create systems that are more resilient to these changes.

AB Global sustainability initiatives are gaining momentum and impact, and place-based research can provide complementary insights to strengthen them. Here, we explore the current and potential role of place-based research into informing global sustainability initiatives by assessing the strengths, challenges, and opportunities. We show that place-based research allows for a better understanding of global social-ecological dynamics, and that transformations towards sustainability are often triggered at the local scale through the co-construction of local solutions. We discuss that the very nature of place-based research can hinder its transferability because its global integration faces temporal, spatial and governance scale mismatches, and we identify some of the key challenges of scaling-up its findings. We highlight new opportunities to mainstream place-based research that are emerging from first, long-term networks of place-based research, second, new institutional research settings that contribute with conceptual comprehensive frameworks and capacity building tools, third, a global community of practice, and fourth, the concept of region as a bridge between local and global sustainability initiatives. We believe that the time is ripe to promote the role of place-based social-ecological research as a key contributor to achieve global sustainability goals.

AB Decisions about natural resource management are frequently complex and vexed, often leading to public policy compromises. Discord between environmental and economic metrics creates problems in assessing trade-offs between different current or potential resource uses. Ecosystem accounts, which quantify ecosystems and their benefits for human well-being consistent with national economic accounts, provide exciting opportunities to contribute significantly to the policy process. We advanced the application of ecosystem accounts in a regional case study by explicitly and spatially linking impacts of human and natural activities on ecosystem assets and services to their associated industries. This demonstrated contributions of ecosystems beyond the traditional national accounts. Our results revealed that native forests would provide greater benefits from their ecosystem services of carbon sequestration, water yield, habitat provisioning and recreational amenity if harvesting for timber production ceased, thus allowing forests to continue growing to older ages.

AB Ecosystem services and sustainability have become prominent concepts in international policy and research agendas. However, a common conceptual ground between these concepts is currently underdeveloped. In particular, a vision is missing on how to align ecosystem services with overarching sustainability goals. Originally, the ecosystem service concept focused on sustaining human well-being through biodiversity conservation. Nevertheless, studies within the field also consider appropriation beyond carrying capacities, and natural resource management that involves environmentally damaging inputs as ecosystem service provision. This brings the ecosystem service concept into conflict with the core goal of sustainability, i.e. achieving justice within ecological limits over the long term. Here, we link the ecosystem service concept to sustainability outcomes operationalized in terms of justice. Our framing positions sustainability as an overarching goal which can be achieved through seven key strategies: equitable (1) intergenerational and (2) intragenerational distribution, (3) interspecies distribution, (4) fair procedures, recognition and participation, (5) sufficiency, (6) efficiency, and (7) persistence. Applying these strategies has the potential to re-focus the ecosystem service concept towards the normative goal of sustainability. We identify research needs for each strategy and further discuss questions regarding operationalization of the strategies. (C) 2017 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

AB Climate refugia are regions that animals can retreat to, persist in and potentially then expand from under changing environmental conditions. Most forecasts of climate change refugia for species are based on correlative species distribution models (SDMs) using long-term climate averages, projected to future climate scenarios. Limitations of such methods include the need to extrapolate into novel environments and uncertainty regarding the extent to which proximate variables included in the model capture processes driving distribution limits (and thus can be assumed to provide reliable predictions under new conditions). These limitations are well documented; however, their impact on the quality of climate refugia predictions is difficult to quantify. Here, we develop a detailed bioenergetics model for the koala. It indicates that range limits are driven by heat-induced water stress, with the timing of rainfall and heat waves limiting the koala in the warmer parts of its range. We compare refugia predictions from the bioenergetics model with predictions from a suite of competing correlative SDMs under a range of future climate scenarios. SDMs were fitted using combinations of long-term climate and weather extremes variables, to test how well each set of predictions captures the knowledge embedded in the bioenergetics model. Correlative models produced broadly similar predictions to the bioenergetics model across much of the species' current range - with SDMs that included weather extremes showing highest congruence. However, predictions in some regions diverged significantly when projecting to future climates due to the breakdown in correlation between climate variables. We provide unique insight into the mechanisms driving koala distribution and illustrate the importance of subtle relationships between the timing of weather events, particularly rain relative to hot-spells, in driving species-climate relationships and distributions. By unpacking the mechanisms captured by correlative SDMs, we can increase our certainty in forecasts of climate change impacts on species.

AB Background: Nitrogen (N) is an essential and often limiting nutrient to plant growth and development. Previous studies have shown that the mRNA expressions of numerous genes are regulated by nitrogen supplies; however, little is known about the expressed non-coding elements, for example long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) that control the response of maize (Zea mays L.) to nitrogen. LncRNAs are a class of non-coding RNAs larger than 200 bp, which have emerged as key regulators in gene expression.
   Results: In this study, we surveyed the intergenic/intronic lncRNAs in maize B73 leaves at the V7 stage under conditions of N-deficiency and N-sufficiency using ribosomal RNA depletion and ultra-deep total RNA sequencing approaches. By integration with mRNA expression profiles and physiological evaluations, 7245 lncRNAs and 637 nitrogen-responsive lncRNAs were identified that exhibited unique expression patterns. Co-expression network analysis showed that the nitrogen-responsive lncRNAs were enriched mainly in one of the three co-expressed modules. The genes in the enriched module are mainly involved in NADH dehydrogenase activity, oxidative phosphorylation and the nitrogen compounds metabolic process.
   Conclusions: We identified a large number of lncRNAs in maize and illustrated their potential regulatory roles in response to N stress. The results lay the foundation for further in-depth understanding of the molecular mechanisms of lncRNAs' role in response to nitrogen stresses.

AB Vegetation and the water cycles are inherently coupled across a wide range of spatial and temporal scales. Water availability interacts with plant ecophysiology and controls vegetation functioning. Concurrently, vegetation has direct and indirect effects on energy, water, carbon, and nutrient cycles. To better understand and model plant-water interactions, highly interdisciplinary approaches are required. We present an overview of the main processes and relevant interactions between water and plants across a range of spatial scales, from the cell level of leaves, where stomatal controls occur, to drought stress at the level of a single tree, to the integrating scales of a watershed, region, and the globe. A review of process representations in models at different scales is presented. More specifically, three main model families are identified: (1) models of plant hydraulics that mechanistically simulate stomatal controls and/or water transport at the tree level; (2) ecohydrological models that simulate plot-to catchment-scale water, energy, and carbon fluxes; and (3) terrestrial biosphere models that simulate carbon, water, and nutrient dynamics at the regional and global scales and address feedback between Earth's vegetation and the climate system. We identify special features and similarities across the model families. Examples of where plant-water interactions are especially important and have led to key scientific findings are also highlighted. Finally, we discuss the various data sources that are currently available to force and validate existing models, and we present perspectives on the evolution of the field.

AB 1. Macrophysiology is the investigation of variation in physiological traits over large geographic and temporal scales and the ecological implications of this variation. It has now been undertaken, as a defined field, for a decade. Here, we overview its conceptual foundations, methodological approaches and insights, together with challenges the field is facing currently. 2. Macrophysiology builds on approaches that investigate the ecological and evolutionary significance of physiological trait variation and feedbacks in these processes. One of its key strengths is its ability to provide a basis for examining interactions among the intraspecific, interspecific and assemblage levels. 3. Macrophysiology is distinct from and typically concerns larger spatial and temporal scales than conservation physiology, whereas it is in several respects similar to, but antecedes, functional biogeography. Contrary to some claims, macrophysiology is not concerned only with the implications for geographic ranges of physiological trait variation. 5. Several insights, which would not otherwise have been achieved, have arisen from the field, notably the understanding of variation in global patterns of upper and lower lethal temperature limits and organism performance, which have important implications for forecasting the impacts of climate change. 6. Ten major challenges are identified for the field of macroecology, including better integration of approaches and information for plants and animals. Nonetheless, the prospects for macrophysiology as a significant way to understand our world remain bright.

AB Members of the archaeal Miscellaneous Crenarchaeotic Group (MCG) are among the most successful microorganisms on the planet. During its evolutionary diversification, this very diverse group has managed to cross the saline-freshwater boundary, one of the most important evolutionary barriers structuring microbial communities. However, the current understanding on the ecological significance of MCG in freshwater habitats is scarce and the evolutionary relationships between freshwater and saline MCG remains poorly known. Here, we carried out molecular phylogenies using publicly available 16S rRNA gene sequences from various geographic locations to investigate the distribution of MCG in freshwater and saline sediments and to evaluate the implications of saline-freshwater transitions during the diversification events. Our approach provided a robust ecological framework in which MCG archaea appeared as a core generalist group in the sediment realm. However, the analysis of the complex intragroup phylogeny of the 21 subgroups currently forming the MCG lineage revealed that distinct evolutionary MCG subgroups have arisen in marine and freshwater sediments suggesting the occurrence of adaptive evolution specific to each habitat. The ancestral state reconstruction analysis indicated that this segregation was mainly due to the occurrence of a few saline-freshwater transition events during the MCG diversification. In addition, a network analysis showed that both saline and freshwater MCG recurrently co-occur with archaea of the class Thermoplasmata in sediment ecosystems, suggesting a potentially relevant trophic connection between the two clades.

AB Aim Maintaining genetic diversity and evolutionary processes are important goals in plant conservation. Genetic studies are increasingly undertaken but results from such studies are still rarely implemented as management actions in the field. We address this 'research-implementation gap' by developing a plain-language genetic assessment approach for population-level conservation prioritization based on measurement of key genetic parameters. Our aim was to improve understanding between conservation researchers and practitioners, enabling practitioners to incorporate genetic information into conservation actions and conservation genetic researchers to address research explicitly resulting in conservation action.
   Location Applicable globally.
   Methods We derived a decision-making framework that identifies appropriate management strategies for threatened populations based on the level of genetic differentiation (F-ST), genetic diversity (expected heterozygosity, H-E) and inbreeding (F-IS), characterized as 'high' or 'low' in comparison with a reference benchmark. We demonstrate the application of the framework in two case studies of threatened plants and more broadly from the literature.
   Results Applying the decision framework, we found that for Prostanthera eurybioides, the population of conservation concern does not currently require specialized genetic management and mitigation of ecological threats should be prioritized instead. For Allocasuarina robusta, we found connectivity was high and strategies should be put in place to maintain gene flow. In both cases, genetic information was important for designing restocking strategies accounting for the genetic structure and genetic diversity of source and recipient populations. From the literature, key examples of species types that fit each of the genetic management scenarios are given.
   Main conclusions We find that the application of our simplified genetic assessment framework helps to clarify management actions based on conservation genetic information for threatened flora, and should assist in bridging the gap between researchers and conservation practitioners for integrated conservation outcomes. Our framework could equally apply to fauna conservation with appropriate consideration of animal-specific management issues.

AB With global biodiversity in decline, there is now an urgent requirement to take ameliorative action for endangered species in the form of re-introductions. For the highly diverse orchid family, many species face imminent extinction. Successful re-introductions that result in self-sustaining populations require not only an understanding of existing threats, but an in-depth understanding of species ecology. Increasingly, translocations, ranging from re-introductions to assisted colonisation, are being adopted as recovery actions. Do these translocations mitigate threatening processes and account for the two key ecological attributes for orchid survival; pollinator and mycorrhizal presence? Here, we conducted a literature review identifying the known threats to orchid survival and their necessary mitigation strategies. Next, we evaluated the success of 74 published international orchid translocations on 66 species against a consideration of orchid ecological attributes. Lastly, we empirically tested an additional 22 previously unpublished re-introductions on 12 species undertaken since 2007 against a re-introduction process that accounts for identified threats and orchid ecological attributes. We identified habitat destruction, weed invasion, herbivory, illegal collection, pollinator decline, pathogens and climate change as critical threats to orchid survival. In our global review based on published translocations, the average survival rate, 1-year post translocation was 66 % yet only 2.8 % of studies reported natural recruitment in field sites. Although survival of translocated orchids is clearly being achieved, these programmes did not relate orchid growth and development to key ecological requirements of orchid population resilience, pollinator and mycorrhizal ecology. Ensuring pollinator and mycorrhizal presence shows that these two factors alone are key factors influencing survival and persistence in an Australian review of 22 previously unpublished orchid re-introductions. In the Australian review flowering in the year following, out-planting was observed for 81 % of the re-introductions with seed set occurring in 63 % of re-introductions within the length of the study. Recruitment was observed in 18 % of the Australian re-introduced populations indicating a degree of population resilience. As orchid re-introductions will be a major strategy for wild orchid conservation in the future, we present a framework for orchid re-introductions, including criteria for success. We recommend symbiotic propagation and, for specialised pollination syndromes, the study of pollinator interactions prior to site selection and re-introduction of plants.

AB The ability to identify the spatial distribution of economically important fungal species is crucial for understanding the environmental factors that affect them and for conservation management. A potentially valuable approach for this is maximum entropy (Maxent) spatial distribution modeling, which was applied here to map the potential distribution of three "Sanghuang" mushrooms in China, which include Phellinus baumii, Phellinus igniarius and Phellinus vaninii. Nineteen WorldClim bioclimatic variables, with corresponding altitude data, and 89 spatially well-dispersed species occurrence records were used in the modeling. The relative importance of the environmental variables was evaluated by Jackknife tests in the modeling. analysis. The maximum entropy models obtained have high Area Under Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC) values: 0.956, 0.967 and 0.960, for P. baumii, P. igniarius and P. vaninii, respectively. The bioclimatic variable that most strongly affected distributions of P. baumii and P. vaninii was precipitation in the warmest quarter, while the mean temperature in the warmest quarter affected the distribution of P. igniarius most strongly. Overall, these models could provide valuable help in searching for the target species in areas where it is hitherto unknown, and be the reference of conservation measures for these medicinal fungal species.

AB Background: Lassa fever is a viral haemorrhagic illness responsible for disease outbreaks across West Africa. It is a zoonosis, with the primary reservoir species identified as the Natal multimammate mouse, Mastomys natalensis. The host is distributed across sub-Saharan Africa while the virus' range appears to be restricted to West Africa. The majority of infections result from interactions between the animal reservoir and human populations, although secondary transmission between humans can occur, particularly in hospital settings.
   Methods: Using a species distribution model, the locations of confirmed human and animal infections with Lassa virus (LASV) were used to generate a probabilistic surface of zoonotic transmission potential across sub-Saharan Africa.
   Results: Our results predict that 37.7 million people in 14 countries, across much of West Africa, live in areas where conditions are suitable for zoonotic transmission of LASV. Four of these countries, where at-risk populations are predicted, have yet to report any cases of Lassa fever.
   Conclusions: These maps act as a spatial guide for future surveillance activities to better characterise the geographical distribution of the disease and understand the anthropological, virological and zoological interactions necessary for viral transmission. Combining this zoonotic niche map with detailed patient travel histories can aid differential diagnoses of febrile illnesses, enabling a more rapid response in providing care and reducing the risk of onward transmission.

Documenting the past and present distribution of LF and its environmental limits is important for a number of reasons. Here, we present an initiative to develop a global atlas of LF and present a new global map of the limits of LF transmission.
   Methods: We undertook a systematic search and assembly of prevalence data worldwide and used a suite of environmental and climatic data and boosted regression trees (BRT) modelling to map the transmission limits of LF.
   Results: Data were identified for 66 of the 72 countries currently endemic and for a further 17 countries where LF is no longer endemic. Our map highlights a restricted and highly heterogeneous distribution in sub-Saharan Africa, with transmission more widespread in West Africa compared to east, central and southern Africa where pockets of transmission occur. Contemporary transmission occurs across much of south and South-east Asia and the Pacific. Interestingly, the risk map reflects environmental conditions suitable for LF transmission across Central and South America, including the southern States of America, although active transmission is only known in a few isolated foci. In countries that have eliminated LF, our predictions of environmental suitability are consistent with historical distribution.
   Conclusions: The global distribution of LF is highly heterogeneous and geographically targeted and sustained control will be required to achieve elimination. This first global map can help evaluate the progress of interventions and guide surveillance activities.

AB Background: Disease risk maps are important tools that help ascertain the likelihood of exposure to specific infectious agents. Understanding how climate change may affect the suitability of habitats for ticks will improve the accuracy of risk maps of tick-borne pathogen transmission in humans and domestic animal populations. Lyme disease (LD) is the most prevalent arthropod borne disease in the US and Europe. The bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi causes LD and it is transmitted to humans and other mammalian hosts through the bite of infected Ixodes ticks. LD risk maps in the transboundary region between the U.S. and Mexico are lacking. Moreover, none of the published studies that evaluated the effect of climate change in the spatial and temporal distribution of I. scapularis have focused on this region.
   Methods: The area of study included Texas and a portion of northeast Mexico. This area is referred herein as the Texas-Mexico transboundary region. Tick samples were obtained from various vertebrate hosts in the region under study. Ticks identified as I. scapularis were processed to obtain DNA and to determine if they were infected with B. burgdorferi using PCR. A maximum entropy approach (MAXENT) was used to forecast the present and future (2050) distribution of B. burgdorferi-infected I. scapularis in the Texas-Mexico transboundary region by correlating geographic data with climatic variables.
   Results: Of the 1235 tick samples collected, 109 were identified as I. scapularis. Infection with B. burgdorferi was detected in 45% of the I. scapularis ticks collected. The model presented here indicates a wide distribution for I. scapularis, with higher probability of occurrence along the Gulf of Mexico coast. Results of the modeling approach applied predict that habitat suitable for the distribution of I. scapularis in the Texas-Mexico transboundary region will remain relatively stable until 2050.
   Conclusions: The Texas-Mexico transboundary region appears to be part of a continuum in the pathogenic landscape of LD. Forecasting based on climate trends provides a tool to adapt strategies in the near future to mitigate the impact of LD related to its distribution and risk for transmission to human populations in the Mexico-US transboundary region.

AB Insect pests are a major threat to agricultural biosecurity across the world, causing substantial economic losses. Majority of the species distribution modeling studies use precise coordinates (latitude/longitude) of species occurrences in Max Ent (or maximum entropy model). However, lack of precise coordinates of insect pest occurrences at national/regional level is a common problem for many countries including India. This is because of the limited resources, lack of nationally coordinated surveys, and growers/farmers' privacy issues; district-level occurrences are commonly available (e.g., National Agricultural Pest Information System or NAPIS in the United States; http://pest.ceris.purdue.edu/). We demonstrated the use of Max Ent to generate a preliminary, district-level map of the potential risk of invasion by an exotic cotton mealybug Phenacoccus solenopsis (Tinsley) (Hemiptera: Pseudococcidae) in India. District-level occurrence data were integrated with bioclimatic variables (values averaged within districts) using MaxEnt. The Max Ent model performed better than random with an average test AUC value of 0.86 (0.05). Our model predictions matched closely with the documented occurrence of P. solenopsis in all nine cotton growing states, and also predicted suitable habitats in other districts across India. The greatest threat of P. solenopsis infestations were predicted in most districts of Gujarat, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, southwestern Punjab, northwestern Rajasthan, and western Haryana. Precipitation of coldest quarter, temperature annual range, and precipitation seasonality were the strongest predictors associated with P. solenopsis distribution. Precipitation of coldest quarter was negatively correlated with P. solenopsis occurrence. Mapping the potential distribution of invasive species is an iterative process, and our study is the first attempt to model national-level risk assessment of P. solenopsis in India. Our results can be used for selecting monitoring and surveillance sites and designing local, regional and national-level integrated pest management policies for cotton and other cultivated crops in India. The maps of potential pest distributions are urgently needed by agriculture managers and policymakers. Our approach can be used in other countries that lack precise coordinates of insect pest occurrences and generate a preliminary map of potential risk because it may be too late to wait for the precise coordinates of pest occurrences to generate a perfect map.

AB The relative contribution of top-down and bottom-up processes regulating primary decomposers can influence the strength of the link between the soil animal community and ecosystem functioning. Although soil bacterial communities are regulated by bottom-up and top-down processes, the latter are considered to be less important in structuring the diversity and functioning of fungal-dominated ecosystems. Despite the huge diversity of mycophagous (fungal-feeding) soil fauna, and their potential to reverse the outcomes of competitive fungal interactions, top-down grazing effects have never been found to translate to community-level changes. We constructed soil mesocosms to investigate the potential of isopods grazing on cord-forming basidiomycete fungi to influence the community composition and functioning of a complex woodland soil microbial community. Using metagenomic sequencing we provide conclusive evidence of direct top-down control at the community scale in fungal-dominated woodland soil. By suppressing the dominant cord-forming basidiomycete fungi, isopods prevented the competitive exclusion of surrounding litter fungi, increasing diversity in a community containing several hundred fungal species. This isopod-induced modification of community composition drove a shift in the soil enzyme profile, and led to a restructuring of the wider mycophagous invertebrate community. We highlight characteristics of different soil ecosystems that will give rise to such top-down control. Given the ubiquity of isopods and basidiomycete fungi in temperate and boreal woodland ecosystems, such top-down community control could be of widespread significance for global carbon and nutrient cycling.

AB 1. To assess recovery of endangered species, reliable information on the size and density of the target population is required. In practice, however, this information has proved hard to acquire, especially for large carnivores that exist at low densities, are cryptic and range widely. Many large carnivore species such as the endangered Florida panther Puma concolor coryi lack clear visual features for individual identification; thus, using standard approaches for estimating population size, such as camera-trapping and capture-recapture modelling, has so far not been possible. 2. We developed a spatial capture-recapture model that requires only a portion of the individuals in the population to be identifiable, using data from two 9-month camera-trapping surveys conducted within the core range of panthers in southwestern Florida. Identity of three radio-collared individuals was known, and we incorporated their telemetry location data into the model to improve parameter estimates. 3. The resulting density estimates of 1<bold>51</bold> (+/- 0<bold>81</bold>) and 1<bold>46</bold> (+/- 0<bold>76</bold>) Florida panthers per 100km(2) for each year are the first estimates for this endangered subspecies and are consistent with estimates for other puma subspecies. 4. A simulation study showed that estimates of density may exhibit some positive bias but coverage of the true values by 95% credible intervals was nominal. 5. Synthesis and applications. This approach provides a framework for monitoring the Florida panther - and other species without conspicuous markings - while fully accounting for imperfect detection and varying sampling effort, issues of fundamental importance in the monitoring of wildlife populations.

AB Increases in rates of individual leaf photosynthesis (P-n) are critical for future increases in yields of rice plants. Although many efforts have been made to improve rice P-n with transgenic technology, the desired increases in P-n have not yet been achieved. Two rice lines with extremely high values of P-n were identified among the backcrossed inbred lines derived from the indica variety Takanari, one of the most productive varieties in Japan, and the elite japonica variety Koshihikari (Koshihikari/Takanari//Takanari). The P-n values of the two lines at an ambient CO2 concentration of 370mol mol(1) as well as at a saturating concentration of CO2 were 2050% higher than those of the parental varieties. Compared with Takanari, these lines had neither a higher content nor a higher activity of ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase when the leaf nitrogen contents were similar, but they did have high mesophyll conductance with respect to CO2 flux due to their higher density and more highly developed lobes of mesophyll cells. These lines also had higher electron transport rates. The plant growth rates of these lines were higher than that of Takanari. The findings show that it is possible to increase P-n significantly, both at the current atmospheric concentration of CO2 and at the increased concentration of CO2 expected in the future, using appropriate combinations of genetic resources that are available at present.

AB Regular economic activity takes into account ecosystem goods and services that are exchanged for money in the market (e.g. food, fibre, water) but normally ignores more intangible ones left away from market transactions (e.g. soil protection, climate regulation, disturbance control, habitat provision), even in cases when they become irreversibly impaired. However, because of the increasing pressure brought by the public opinion, the attempts to assign an economic, yet volatile, valuation to ecosystems assets has multiplied in recent years, and policy communities are increasingly compelled to incorporate them into land use planning initiatives. Based on contributions to this special issue, we discuss how the perspective of ecosystem services can contribute to develop sound land-use policies and planning actions. Beyond valuation, several practical implications emerge from the contributions. A myriad of potential tradeoffs must be analyzed because since the provision of some services can be accompanied by the emergence of unexpected dis-services. For example, carbon accumulation based on increasing net primary production rates may simultaneously cut water yields and, hence, water provision. Various existing mechanisms ranging from state-controlled to market-controlled for rewarding the provision of ecosystem services are analyzed and discussed in terms of their capacity to connect nature to land-use planning.

AB Because of the unique conditions that exist around the Antarctic continent, Southern Ocean (SO) ecosystems are very susceptible to the growing impact of global climate change and other anthropogenic influences. Consequently, there is an urgent need to understand how SO marine life will cope with expected future changes in the environment. Studies of Antarctic organisms have shown that individual species and higher taxa display different degrees of sensitivity to environmental shifts, making it difficult to predict overall community or ecosystem responses. This emphasizes the need for an improved understanding of the Antarctic benthic ecosystem response to global climate change using a multitaxon approach with consideration of different levels of biological organization. Here, we provide a synthesis of the ability of five important Antarctic benthic taxa (Foraminifera, Nematoda, Amphipoda, Isopoda, and Echinoidea) to cope with changes in the environment (temperature, pH, ice cover, ice scouring, food quantity, and quality) that are linked to climatic changes. Responses from individual to the taxon-specific community level to these drivers will vary with taxon but will include local species extinctions, invasions of warmer-water species, shifts in diversity, dominance, and trophic group composition, all with likely consequences for ecosystem functioning. Limitations in our current knowledge and understanding of climate change effects on the different levels are discussed.

AB Large mammalian herbivores significantly alter the functioning of a range of ecosystems worldwide. One family of herbivores in particular, deer (Cervidae), have become widespread throughout temperate regions over the last century. Culling is frequently used to reduce the ecological impacts of deer, but recent studies demonstrate that the recovery of herbivore-disturbed vegetation is often a protracted process on the order of decades. Here, we ask why increases in deer-preferred plants occur slowly following culling and what generalities can inform management of the responses of vegetation to deer culling? Vegetation changes following deer population reduction may be slow because of the: (i) slow growth rate of plants relative to the amount of biomass consumed by herbivores; (ii) depletion of seed sources of deer-preferred plants; (iii) formation of alternate vegetation types under high deer browsing; (iv) preferential browsing of forage even under low deer densities; (v) variation in browse damage of deer-preferred species with plant community composition (e.g. associational resistance or susceptibility); (vi) suppression of trophic cascades; and (vii) changes in abiotic conditions associated with other ecological processes. Managers can accelerate recovery through different active management strategies that directly address the reasons behind slow recovery. However, while the ecology behind the impacts of deer, and to a certain extent their mitigation, are largely understood, a significant obstacle to achieving recovery often lies in implementing science-based management recommendations, e.g. culling, and their societal acceptance. Bridging the science-policy-practice gap requires that applied ecologists share common language and values with policymakers and the public. Recovery may hinge as much on bridging this communication gap as on improving our ecological understanding of deer impacts and ecosystem recovery. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The importance of ecological management for reducing the vulnerability of biodiversity to climate change is increasingly recognized, yet frameworks to facilitate a structured approach to climate adaptation management are lacking. We developed a conceptual framework that can guide identification of climate change impacts and adaptive management options in a given region or biome. The framework focuses on potential points of early climate change impact, and organizes these along two main axes. First, it recognizes that climate change can act at a range of ecological scales. Secondly, it emphasizes that outcomes are dependent on two potentially interacting and countervailing forces: (1) changes to environmental parameters and ecological processes brought about by climate change, and (2) responses of component systems as determined by attributes of resistance and resilience. Through this structure, the framework draws together a broad range of ecological concepts, with a novel emphasis on attributes of resistance and resilience that can temper the response of species, ecosystems and landscapes to climate change. We applied the framework to the world's largest remaining Mediterranean-climate woodland, the 'Great Western Woodlands' of south-western Australia. In this relatively intact region, maintaining inherent resistance and resilience by preventing anthropogenic degradation is of highest priority and lowest risk. Limited, higher risk options such as fire management, protection of refugia and translocation of adaptive genes may be justifiable under more extreme change, hence our capacity to predict the extent of change strongly impinges on such management decisions. These conclusions may contrast with similar analyses in degraded landscapes, where natural integrity is already compromised, and existing investment in restoration may facilitate experimentation with higher risk options.

AB Groundwater in sufficient amounts and of suitable quality is essential for potable water supplies, crop irrigation and healthy habitats for plant and animal biocenoses. The groundwater resource is currently under severe pressure from land use and pollution and there is evidence of dramatic changes in aquifer resources in Europe and elsewhere, despite numerous policy measures on sustainable use and protection of groundwater. Little is known about how such changes affect groundwater dependent ecosystems (GDEs), which include various aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems above ground and inside the aquifer. Future management must take this uncertainty into account. This paper focuses on multiple aspects of groundwater science, policy and sustainable management. Examples of current management methods and practices are presented for selected aquifers in Europe and an assessment is made of the effectiveness of existing policies such as the European Water Framework Directive and the Habitat Directive in practice and of how groundwaters and GDEs are managed in various conditions. The paper highlights a number of issues that should be considered in an integrated and holistic approach to future management of groundwater and its dependent ecosystems. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The evaluation of ecosystems and biodiversity has become an important field of investigation for economists. Although their interest has been largely motivated by the search for arguments in favour of broader conservation policies, both the methods and the meaning of the results remain controversial. This article aims at clarifying the interest and limitations of these works, by revisiting a number of issues, such as the economic qualification of the services that human societies take from biodiversity and ecological systems in general, the specificities of their contribution to human well-being and the consequences of a valuation of biodiversity based on ecosystem services. We conclude with a discussion of the purposes of evaluations: improving public policies or creating new markets? (C) 2011 Academie des sciences. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB There is increasing use of networks in ecology and epidemiology, but still relatively little application in phytopathology. Networks are sets of elements (nodes) connected in various ways by links (edges). Network analysis aims to understand system dynamics and outcomes in relation to network characteristics. Many existing natural, social, and technological networks have been shown to have small-world (local connectivity with short-cuts) and scale-free (presence of super-connected nodes) properties. In this review, we discuss how network concepts can be applied in plant pathology from the molecular to the landscape and global level. Wherever disease spread occurs not just because of passive/natural dispersion but also due to artificial movements, it makes sense to superimpose realistic models of the trade in plants on spatially explicit models of epidemic development. We provide an example of an emerging pathosystem (Phytophthora ramorum) where a theoretical network approach has proven particularly fruitful in analyzing the spread of disease in the UK plant trade. These studies can help in assessing the future threat posed by similar emerging pathogens. Networks have much potential in plant epidemiology and should become part of the standard curriculum.

ID GULO-GULO; HIERARCHICAL MODEL; SIZE; INFERENCE
AB Classical closed-population capture-recapture models do not accommodate the spatial information inherent in encounter history data obtained from camera-trapping studies. As a result, individual heterogeneity in encounter probability is induced, and it is not possible to estimate density objectively because trap arrays do not have a well-defined sample area. We applied newly-developed, capture-recapture models that accommodate the spatial attribute inherent in capture-recapture data to a population of wolverines (Gulo gulo) in Southeast Alaska in 2008. We used camera-trapping data collected from 37 cameras in a 2,140-km(2) area of forested and open habitats largely enclosed by ocean and glacial icefields. We detected 21 unique individuals 115 times. Wolverines exhibited a strong positive trap response, with an increased tendency to revisit previously visited traps. Under the trap-response model, we estimated wolverine density at 9.7 individuals/1,000 km(2) (95% Bayesian CI: 5.9-15.0). Our model provides a formal statistical framework for estimating density from wolverine camera-trapping studies that accounts for a behavioral response due to baited traps. Further, our model-based estimator does not have strict requirements about the spatial configuration of traps or length of trapping sessions, providing considerable operational flexibility in the development of field studies.

AB Data on macroinvertebrates of selected reference sites were compiled from a long-term monitoring programme carried out in the Mediterranean Catalan Basins (NE Spain) that permitted analysis for nine years, from 1996 to 2004, using a homogeneous data collection procedure. This study aims to analyse the differences in composition and structure of macroinvertebrate communities at family level in five Mediterranean river types, and the values of biological quality metrics (IBMWP and IASPT indices, taxon richness and EFT) in reference conditions. Also differences between seasons (spring vs. summer) and between dry and wet periods were analysed. The dry and wet periods were determined using the Standardised Precipitation Index (SPI). A total of 29 reference sites were selected out of 184 sampling sites analysed, and 171 reference samples were available (from 1996 to 2004), of which 88 were sampled in dry periods, whereas 83 correspond to wet periods. Differences on community composition at family level were appreciated, clustering the rivers in three different groups: (1) rivers with a continuous flow regime located in siliceous zones: (2) rivers with a continuous flow regime located in calcareous zones: and (3) temporary rivers regardless of geology. Moreover, our results explain that the characteristics of hydrological periods (dry and wet) characterize the differences between communities better than just the season. The analysis of four biological quality metrics reveals clear differences between values obtained from dry and wet periods concerning taxon richness, EPT values and IBMWP biological indices, whereas the IASPT index does not show significant differences. The median taxonomic richness in wet periods is 32 macroinvertebrate families per sample while in dry periods this value falls to 22. Reference values of IBMWP index, the total number of taxa, and EPT metric are different between dry and wet periods in spring samples, while these differences are not relevant for IASPT index except for temporary streams. Hydrological specific conditions should additionally be considered in order to better calculate biological reference conditions, and to properly apply biological quality metrics used to establish the ecological status in Mediterranean rivers, especially in temporary ones. The use of the dry-wet period classification according to the climate characteristic results is a more accurate application of the Water Framework Directive in Mediterranean rivers. Implications of future climate change should be also considered from our results. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The Brazilian rosewood (Dalbergia nigra) is an endangered tree endemic to the central Brazilian Atlantic Forest, one of the world's most threatened biomes. The population diversity, phylogeographic structure and demographic history of this species were investigated using the variation in the chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) sequences of 185 individuals from 19 populations along the geographical range of the species. Fifteen haplotypes were detected in the analysis of 1297 bp from two non-coding sequences, trnV-trnM and trnL. We identified a strong genetic structure (F-ST = 0.62, P<0.0001), with a latitudinal separation into three phylogeographic groups. The two northernmost groups showed evidence of having maintained historically larger populations than the southern-most group. Estimates of divergence times between these groups pointed to vicariance events in the Middle Pleistocene (ca. 350 000-780 000 years ago). The recurrence of past climatic changes in the central part of the Atlantic forest, with cycles of forest expansion and contraction, may have led to repeated vicariance events, resulting in the genetic differentiation of these groups. Based on comparisons among the populations of large reserves and small, disturbed fragments of the same phylogeographic group, we also found evidence of recent anthropogenic effects on genetic diversity. The results were also analysed with the aim of contributing to the conservation of D. nigra. We suggest that the three phylogeographic groups could be considered as three distinct management units. Based on the genetic diversity and uniqueness of the populations, we also indicate priority areas for conservation. Heredity (2011) 106, 46-57; doi:10.1038/hdy.2010.64; published online 2 June 2010

AB P>Exotic plant invasions can alter ecosystem processes, particularly if the invasive species are functionally different from native species. We investigated whether such alterations can be explained by differences in functional traits between native and invasive plants of the same functional group or by differences in functional group affiliation.
   We compared six invasive forbs in Europe with six native forbs and six native graminoids in leaf and whole-plant traits, plasticity in response to nutrient supply and interspecific competition, litter decomposition rate, effects on soil nutrient availability, and allelopathy. All traits were measured in a series of pot experiments, and leaf traits additionally in the field.
   Invasive forbs differed from native forbs for only a few traits; they had less leaf chlorophyll and lower phosphorus (P) uptake from soil, but they tended to have a stronger allelopathic effect. The invasive forbs differed in many traits from the native graminoids, their leaves had lower tissue densities and a shorter life span, their litter decomposed faster and they had a lower nitrogen-use efficiency.
   Our results suggest that invasive forbs have the potential to alter ecosystem properties when invading graminoid-dominated and displacing native graminoids but not when displacing native forbs.

AB Lineage diversification in the Neotropics is an interesting topic in evolutionary biology but is also one of the least understood. The abiotic and biotic complexity of the region precludes generalizations that can be drawn regarding the historical evolutionary processes responsible for the diversity observed. The snake genus Leptodeira provides an excellent opportunity to investigate such processes because it spans the entire Neotropical region. In this study, we infer the phylogenetic position of Leptodeira within Dipsadinae, estimate evolutionary relationships among and within Leptodeira species, and estimate the diversification time and biogeography of the genus. Three mitochondrial gene regions were sequenced for individuals representing all the Leptodeira species and most subspecies currently recognized. Additionally, two nuclear protein-coding gene regions were sequenced for representatives of each species and several genera within the Dipsadinae. We infer that several Leptodeira species are either paraphyletic or polyphyletic as currently recognized, and that most recognized subspecies are not monophyletic lineages. Despite the taxonomic discordance with evolutionary relationships, clades appear to correspond very well to major biogeographic regions of Mexico, Central America and South America. Our results thus highlight the important role of the Miocene and Pliocene for lineage diversification in the Neotropics. Additionally, our time estimates suggest that recent intraspecific phylogeographic structure is likely the result of habitat and climatic fluctuations during the Pleistocene. Cumulatively, our inferences of lineage diversification within Leptodeira suggest a complex evolutionary scenario in the Mexican transition zone and a north to south expansion with a final colonization of the tropics in South America.

AB Forecasting the spatial spread of invasive species is important to inform management planning. Niche-based species distribution models offer a well-developed framework for assessing the potential range of species. However, these models assume equilibrium between the species' distribution and its ecological requirements. During range expansion, invasive species are not in such equilibrium due to both dispersal limitation and frequent casual occurrence in sites unsuitable to persistent populations. In this article we use the example of the invasive annual plant Ambrosia artemisiifolia in Austria to evaluate if model accuracy can be enhanced in such non-equilibrium situations by taking account of propagule pressure and by restricting model calibration to naturalized populations. Moreover, we test if model accuracy increases during invasion history using distribution data from 1984 to 2005. The results suggest that models calibrated with naturalized populations are much more accurate than those based on the total set of records. Proxies of propagule pressure slightly but significantly improve goodness of fit, accuracy, and Type I and II error rates of models calibrated with all available records but have less consistent effects on models of naturalized populations. Model accuracy did not increase during the recent invasion history, probably because the species is still far from an equilibrium distribution. We conclude that even a coarse assessment of population status with records of invasive species delivers important information for predictive modelling and that proxies of propagule pressure should be included into such models at least during early to intermediate stages of the invasion history.

AB Background: Over the past two decades, there have been several approximate methods that adopt different mutation models and used for estimating nonsynonymous and synonymous substitution rates (Ka and Ks) based on protein-coding sequences across species or even different evolutionary lineages. Among them, MYN method (a Modified version of Yang-Nielsen method) considers three major dynamic features of evolving DNA sequences-bias in transition/transversion rate, nucleotide frequency, and unequal transitional substitution but leaves out another important feature: unequal substitution rates among different sites or nucleotide positions.
   Results: We incorporated a new feature for analyzing evolving DNA sequences-unequal substitution rates among different sites-into MYN method, and proposed a modified version, namely gamma(gamma)-MYN, based on an assumption that the evolutionary rate at each site follows a mode of gamma-distribution. We applied gamma-MYN to analyze the key estimator of selective pressure omega (Ka/Ks) and other relevant parameters in comparison to two other related methods, YN and MYN, and found that neglecting the variation of substitution rates among different sites may lead to biased estimations of omega. Our new method appears to have minimal deviations when relevant parameters vary within normal ranges defined by empirical data.
   Conclusion: Our results indicate that unequal substitution rates among different sites have variable influences on omega under different evolutionary rates while both transition/transversion rate ratio and unequal nucleotide frequencies affect Ka and Ks thus selective pressure omega.

AB Road mortality is an increasing problem for terrestrial vertebrate conservation due to the increase of both road numbers and vehicle flow. We hypothesize that the probability of a predator being killed on the road is related to the presence of its prey adjacent to the road, which is likely to be related to the use that these predators make of road verges. We aim to identify the features of specific stretches of road where road-kills of a predator (European polecat) occur in Mediterranean landscapes, including the presence of its main prey (European rabbit) and landscape and road features. We compared 85 100 m long stretches of road where at least one road-kill was recorded with 104 stretches without any road-kill in a dry agricultural landscape in central Spain. We used regression analysis to investigate the relationship between road-kill occurrence and the features in the 67% of the cases. Road-kill stretches were characterised by greater numbers of rabbit burrows in the road verges and by higher traffic flow and speed (i.e. higher speed limit, lower proportion of heavy vehicles, wider road and lower proportion of unbroken central lines). Road-kill stretches also had more metres built over bridges and lower densities of people. We validated our best model with a dataset (the 33% of the cases) not included in its development, which correctly classified 82% of road-kill stretches and 89% of non-road kill stretches. Our results highlight the need for taking into account food resource distribution when studying causes of animal road-kills.

   LIMITS; RECRUITMENT; ENVIRONMENT; POPULATION; PHYSIOLOGY
AB Habitat temperature is often assumed to serve as an effective proxy for organism body temperature when making predictions of species distributions under future climate change. However, the determinants of body temperature are complex, and organisms in identical microhabitats can occupy radically different thermal niches. This can have major implications of our understanding of how thermal stress modulates predator-prey relationships under field conditions. Using body temperature data from four different sites on Santa Cruz Island, California, we show that at two sites the body temperatures of a keystone predator (the seastar Pisaster ochraceus) and its prey (the mussel Mytilus californianus) followed very different trajectories, even though both animals occupied identical microhabitats. At the other two sites, body temperatures of predator and prey were closely coupled across a range of scales. The dynamical differences between predator and prey body temperatures depended on the location of pairs of sites, at the extremes of a persistent landscape-scale weather pattern observed across the island. Thus, the well understood predator-prey interaction between Pisaster and Mytilus cannot be predicted based on habitat-level information alone, as is now commonly attempted with landscape-level ('climate envelope') models.

AB Ecologists need to develop tools that allow characterization of vegetation condition over scales that are pertinent to species' persistence and appropriate for management actions. Our study shows that stand condition can be mapped accurately over the floodplain of a major river system (ca 100,000 ha of forest over 1600 km of river)-the Murray River in southeastern Australia. It demonstrates the value of using quantitative ground surveys in conjunction with remotely sensed data to model vegetation condition over very large spatial domains. A comparison of four modelling methods found that stand condition was best modelled using the multivariate adaptive regression spline (MARS) method (R (2) = 0.85), although there was little difference among the methods (R (2) = 0.77-0.85). However, a subsequent validation survey of condition at new locations showed that use of artificial neural networks had substantially higher predictive power (R (2) = 0.78) than the MARS model (R (2) = 0.28). This discrepancy demonstrates the value of using several modelling approaches to determine relationships among vegetation responses and environmental variables, and stresses the importance of validating ecological models with predictive surveys conducted after model building. The artificial neural network was used to produce a stand condition map for the whole floodplain, which predicted that only 30% of the area containing Eucalyptus camaldulensis stands is currently in good condition. There is a downstream decline in stand condition, which is related to more extreme declines in flooding, due to water harvesting, and drier climate found in the Lower Murray region. Rigorous surveying and modelling approaches, such as those used here, are necessary if vegetation health is to be effectively monitored and managed.

AB Background: Leaf traits are important in determining the capacity for a plant to acquire carbon, but few data are available for montane cloud forests in the Andes.
   Aims: To investigate the changes in leaf traits along a large altitudinal transect (220-3600 m) from lowland to montane cloud forest in Peru.
   Methods: We determined leaf mass per area (LMA, g m(-2)), leaf tissue density (L-d, g cm(-3)), and foliar nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) content, both on a mass (N-m and P-m, %) and area (N-a and P-a, g m(-2)) basis for the most abundant species locally.
   Results: LMA increased with altitude (62.8-169.4 g m(-2)), though overall, LMA was lower than in comparable tropical elevation gradients. N-m declined significantly with altitude (2.39-1.25 %, P < 0.05), but N-m contents were higher than in comparable studies. The relatively high N-m and low LMA values are consistent with published global leaf trait datasets. No altitudinal trend for P-m was found; rather, our data highlighted the spatial variability in P-m (and P-a) within and among sites at different elevations. Foliar N:P ratios did not show a trend with altitude and did not indicate N limitation except at 3000 m altitude.
   Conclusions: Though leaf traits showed altitudinal trends similar to other studies, contrary to the general hypothesis, our data suggest that the tropical montane forests presented here are not N limited.

AB Zooplankton communities were studied in southeastern Beaufort Sea (Arctic Ocean) in September-October 2002. Cluster analysis and non-metric multidimensional scaling revealed three distinct mesozooplankton assemblages. A neritic assemblage occurred on the Mackenzie Shelf and in Franklin Bay, while distinct off-shelf assemblages prevailed in the Cape Bathurst Polynya and on the Beaufort Slope respectively. Over 95% of the mesozooplankton was comprised of eight copepod taxa. Pseudocalanus spp. contributed predominantly to the discrimination of the three assemblages and was the only significant indicator of the Shelf assemblage. Oithona similis, Oncaea borealis, Metridia longa and Calanus hyperboreus were indicators of the Polynya assemblage. Cyclopina sp. and Microcalanus pygmaeus were indicative of the overall off-shelf community (Polynya and Slope assemblages). The importance of omnivores and carnivores increased from the shelf to the polynya and the slope. Station depth and duration of reduced ice conditions during summer (<50% ice concentration) underpinned the distribution of the assemblages (r(2)=0.71 and 0.45 respectively). The abundance of Pseudocalanus spp. was independent of depth and increased with the duration of reduced ice conditions (r(s)=0.438). The abundance of Cyclopina sp., M. pygmaeus and other indicators of the offshore assemblages followed the opposite trend (r(s)=-0.467 and -0.5 respectively). Under continued climate warming, a reduction of the ice cover will affect the biogeography of mesozooplankton on and around the Mackenzie Shelf, to the potential advantage of Pseudocalanus spp. and other calanoid herbivores.

AB In this paper we present a Histogram Matching Approach (HMA) for assessment of the flow regime alteration. The HMA uses the degree of histo-rain dissimilarity as a metric for impact assessment, which is based on the quadratic-form distance between the frequency vectors of the pre- and post-impact histograms weighted by a specified similarity matrix. The HMA is coupled with an aggregated multiobjective optimization genetic algorithm and applied to a case study on the Kaoping diversion weir (Taiwan) for determining the optimal environmental flow scheme that balances the ecosystem and human needs objectives. Two key issues are addressed in this study. First. we compare the performances of the HMA and existing Range of Variability Approach (RVA). Second, we employ three types of similarity function to investigate their effect on the Outcomes of the HMA. The results reveal that the HMA consistently outperforms the RVA in preserving the natural flow variability regardless of what type of similarity function is used. No single type of similarity function can be found that would simultaneously best preserve the natural patterns of 32 Indicators of Hydrologic Alteration (IHA). For the situations where the water-supply reliability is of critical concerti, the pulse similarity is recommended because it would assure the smallest water-supply deficit. If, however, minor degradation in the water-supply reliability may he overlooked. the linear similarity is suggested because it would generally result in the post-impact flows that most satisfactorily resemble to the natural flow regime.

AB Background: Leishmania infantum is the causative agent of visceral and cutaneous leishmaniasis in the Mediterranean region, South America, and China. MON-1 L. infantum is the predominating zymodeme in all endemic regions, both in humans and dogs, the reservoir host. In order to answer important epidemiological questions it is essential to discriminate strains of MON-1.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: We have used a set of 14 microsatellite markers to analyse 141 strains of L. infantum mainly from Spain, Portugal, and Greece of which 107 strains were typed by MLEE as MON-1. The highly variable microsatellites have the potential to discriminate MON-1 strains from other L. infantum zymodemes and even within MON-1 strains. Model- and distance-based analysis detected a considerable amount of structure within European L. infantum. Two major monophyletic groups-MON-1 and non-MON-1-could be distinguished, with non-MON-1 being more polymorphic. Strains of MON-98, 77, and 108 were always part of the MON-1 group. Among MON-1, three geographically determined and genetically differentiated populations could be identified: ( 1) Greece; ( 2) Spain islands-Majorca/Ibiza; ( 3) mainland Portugal/Spain. All four populations showed a predominantly clonal structure; however, there are indications of occasional recombination events and gene flow even between MON-1 and non-MON-1. Sand fly vectors seem to play an important role in sustaining genetic diversity. No correlation was observed between Leishmania genotypes, host specificity, and clinical manifestation. In the case of relapse/re-infection, only re-infections by a strain with a different MLMT profile can be unequivocally identified, since not all strains have individual MLMT profiles.
   Conclusion: In the present study for the first time several key epidemiological questions could be addressed for the MON-1 zymodeme, because of the high discriminatory power of microsatellite markers, thus creating a basis for further epidemiological investigations.

AB Models that predict distribution are now widely used to understand the patterns and processes of plant and animal occurrence as well as to guide conservation and management of rare or threatened species. Application of these methods has led to corresponding studies evaluating the sensitivity of model performance to requisite data and other factors that may lead to imprecise or false inferences. We expand upon these works by providing a relative measure of the sensitivity of model parameters and prediction to common sources of error, bias, and variability. We used a one-at-a-time sample design and GPS location data for woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) to assess one common species-distribution model: a resource selection function. Our measures of sensitivity included change in coefficient values, prediction success, and the area of mapped habitats following the systematic introduction of geographic error and bias in occurrence data, thematic misclassification of resource maps, and variation in model design. Results suggested that error, bias and model variation have a large impact on the direct interpretation of coefficients. Prediction success and definition of important habitats were less responsive to the perturbations we introduced to the baseline model. Model coefficients, prediction success, and area of ranked habitats were most sensitive to positional error in species locations followed by sampling bias, misclassification of resources, and variation in model design. We recommend that researchers report, and practitioners consider, levels of error and bias introduced to predictive species-distribution models. Formal sensitivity and uncertainty analyses are the most effective means for evaluating and focusing improvements on input data and considering the range of values possible from imperfect models.

AB Despite its size and attractiveness, many Lucanus cervus sites remain undetected in NW Europe because of its short flight period and its nocturnal activity. Therefore, presentday designated conservation areas for L. cervus are probably insufficient for a sustainable conservation of the species. We applied eight species distribution modelling techniques (artificial neural networks, classification tree analysis, generalised additive models, generalised boosting models, generalised linear models, mixture discriminant analysis, multiple adaptive regression splines and random forests) to predict the distribution of L cervus in Belgium using 10 randomly generated calibration and evaluation sets. We used AUC, sensitivity (% correctly predicted presences in the evaluation set) and specificity (% correctly predicted absences in the evaluation set) and Kappa statistics to compare model performances. To avoid the incorporation of only marginally suitable woodland sites into the Natura 2000 network, we, conservatively, considered the species as being present only in grid cells where all 10 randomly generated model sets predicted the species as such. Model performance was, on average, good allowing to predict the potential distribution of L. cervus accurately. According to the predicted distribution using the more robust prevalence threshold, only 5731 ha (11% of the potentially suitable area) is protected under the Natura 2000 scheme in Belgium. Subsequently, we categorised the potentially suitable woodlands into three conservation priority categories based on their surface area and the already designated Natura 2000 area. Including the most suitable L. cervus woodlands previously not included in the Natura 2000 sites within such network would require protecting an area of 15,260 ha. Finally, we discuss the implications of using species distribution modelling for nature policy decisions in designating conservation networks. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The rate of species loss is increasing at a global scale, and human-induced extinctions are biased toward predator species. We examined the effects of predator extinctions on a foundation species, the eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica). We performed a factorial experiment manipulating the presence and abundance of three of the most common predatory crabs, the blue crab (Callinectes sapidus), stone crab (Menippe mercenaria), and mud crab (Panopeus herbstii) in estuaries in the eastern United States. We tested the effects of species richness and identity of predators on juvenile oyster survival, oyster recruitment, and organic matter content of sediment. We also manipulated the density of each of the predators and controlled for the loss of biomass of species by maintaining a constant mass of predators in one set of treatments and simultaneously using an additive design. This design allowed us to test the density dependence of our results and test for functional compensation by other species.
   The identity of predator species, but not richness, affected oyster populations. The loss of blue crabs, alone or in combination with either of the other species, affected the survival rate of juvenile oysters. Blue crabs and stone crabs both affected oyster recruitment and sediment organic matter negatively. Mud crabs at higher than ambient densities, however, could fulfill some of the functions of blue and stone crabs, suggesting a level of ecological redundancy. Importantly, the strong effects of blue crabs in all processes measured no longer occurred when individuals were present at higher-than-ambient densities. Their role as dominant predator is, therefore, dependent on their density within the system and the density of other species within their guild (e. g., mud crabs). Our findings support the hypothesis that the effects of species loss at higher trophic levels are determined by predator identity and are subject to complex intraguild interactions that are largely density dependent. Understanding the role of biodiversity in ecosystem functioning or addressing practical concerns, such as loss of predators owing to overharvesting, remains complicated because accurate predictions require detailed knowledge of the system and should be drawn from sound experimental evidence, not based on observations or generalized models.

AB 1. The impact of climate on marine ecosystems is now well documented, but remains complex. Climate change may interact with human activities to effect population dynamics. In addition, in migratory species conditions are different between the breeding and wintering grounds, resulting in more complex dynamics. All these possible effects should be considered to predict the future of endangered species, but very few studies have investigated such combined interactions.
   2. As a case study, we assessed the relative impact of fisheries and of oceanographic conditions in breeding and wintering sites on adult survival and breeding success of a population of the endangered black-browed albatross Thalassarche melanophrys in the Kerguelen Islands, Southern Indian Ocean. This study was based on long-term monitoring of individually marked individuals (1979-2005) and identification by tracking studies and band recoveries of the oceanic feeding zones used during breeding and non-breeding seasons.
   3. Breeding success was variable until 1997 and then declined gradually, from 0.88 to 0.48 chicks per egg laid. It was favoured by positive sea-surface temperature anomalies (SSTA) and trawl fishery during the breeding period, whereas it was negatively affected by positive SSTA around Tasmania, where the species winters. Adult survival was 0.918 +/- 0.004 on average and increased with SSTA during incubation, but decreased significantly with high tuna longlining effort in the wintering zone.
   4. Our analyses show that demographic parameters were influenced by both climate and fisheries in both breeding and wintering grounds, but with different effect size. Black-browed albatross breeding success was more favoured by trawlers' offal and discards than by any of the seasonally/spatially oceanographic conditions, whereas their survival was equally affected by tuna longline fishery through incidental by-catch and spring SSTA.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Our work underlines that a comprehensive knowledge of the life history of a species in all the habitats used is important to disentangle the respective roles of environmental conditions and human factors on population dynamics. Identification of these effects is required when proposing effective conservation measures, because the conservation of threatened species may depend on their wintering country's exclusive economic zones.

AB The geographical pattern of speciation and the relationship between floral variation and species ranges were investigated in the tribe Sinningieae (Gesneriaceae), which is found mainly in the Atlantic forests of Brazil. Geographical distribution data recorded on a grid system of 0.5 x 0.5 degree intervals and a near-complete species-level phylogenetic tree of Sinningieae inferred from a simultaneous analysis of seven DNA regions were used to address the role of geographical isolation in speciation. Geographical range overlaps between sister lineages were measured across all nodes in the phylogenetic tree and analyzed in relation to relative ages estimated from branch lengths. Although there are several cases of species sympatry in Sinningieae, patterns of sympatry between sister taxa support the predominance of allopatric speciation. The pattern of sympatry between sister taxa is consistent with range shifts following allopatric speciation, except in one clade, in which the overlapping distribution of recent sister species indicates speciation within a restricted geographical area and involving changes in pollinators and habitats. The relationship between floral divergence and regional sympatry was also examined by analyzing floral contrasts, phenological overlap, and the degree of sympatry between sister clades. Morphological contrast between flowers is not increased in sympatry and phenological divergence is more apparent between allopatric clades than between sympatric clades. Therefore, our results failed to indicate a tendency for sympatric taxa to minimize morphological and phenological overlap (geographic exclusion and/or character displacement hypotheses). Instead, they point toward adaptation in phenology to local conditions and buildup of sympatries at random with respect to flower morphology. Additional studies at a lower geographical scale are needed to identify truely coexisting species and the components of their reproductive isolation.

AB The photosynthetic characteristics of current-year stems of six deciduous tree species, two evergreen tree species and ginkgo (Ginkgo biloba L.) were compared. Gas exchange, chlorophyll concentration, nitrogen concentration and maximum quantum yield of PSII were measured in stems in summer and winter. A light-induced decrease in stem CO, efflux was observed in all species. The apparent gross photosynthetic rate in saturating light ranged from 0.72 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) (ginkgo, in winter) to 3.73 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) (Alnus glutinosa (L.) Gaertn., in summer). Despite this variability, a unique correlation (slope = 0.75), based on our results and those reported in the literature, was found between gross photosynthetic rate and dark respiration rate. Mass-based gross photosynthetic rate decreased with stein mass per area and correlated to chlorophyll concentration and nitrogen concentration, both in summer and winter. The radial distribution of stein chlorophyll differed among species, but all species except ginkgo had chlorophyll as deep as the pith. In summer, the maximum quantum yield of stein PSII (estimated from the ratio of variable to maximal fluorescence; F(V)/F(M)) of all species was near the optimal Value found for leaves. By contrast, the values were highly variable in winter, suggesting large differences in sensitivity to low-temperature photoinhibition. The winter values of F(V)/F(m) were only 31-60% of summer values for the deciduous species, whereas the evergreen conifer species maintained high F(V)/F(m) in winter. The results highlight the interspecific variability of gross photosynthesis in the stein and its correlation with structural traits like those found for leaves. The structural correlations suggest that the selection of photosynthetic traits has operated Under similar constraints in steins and leaves.

AB Nothofagus pumilio ( Poepp. et Endl.) Krasser is a broadleaved deciduous tree that dominates high-elevation forests in the southern Andes. We evaluated the degree to which differences in stomatal density and physiological traits ( net assimilation, conductance and water use efficiency) were related to environmental and genetic influences with elevation by comparing plants growing under field and common garden conditions. Low-elevation leaves under field conditions had fewer stomata, although this pattern was not maintained in the common garden. Assimilation rates were > 40% higher for high-elevation plants in the field, and 18% higher in the common garden, than those for low-elevation plants. In addition, under field conditions high-elevation plants tended to have higher stomatal conductance and lower instantaneous water use efficiency than did low-elevation plants; however, these differences were not significant in the common garden. Thus, assimilation seems to be under genetic control whereas ecophysiological traits related to the use of water appear to be more responsive to environmental cues. Our results suggest that plants growing along elevational gradients may show complex ecophysiological patterns. These patterns may be acquired by genetically driven responses to conditions that are fixed throughout the life span of individuals, such as soil nutrients. Also plastic adjustments may favour opportunistic use of available water during the dry season, particularly under Mediterranean-type climate regimes with summer drought.

AB The Alexander Archipelago of Southeast Alaska encompasses over 2000 named islands that extend along 600 kin of the North Pacific Coast. This review summarizes recent research on mammals of this largely unexplored region. Field inventories followed by preliminary molecular genetic analyses of selected mammals demonstrate substantial spatial structure consistent with both the dynamic geologic history of this boreal region and the highly insular landscape. New views of taxonomic diversity, biogeographic history, and contemporary population connectivity lay a framework for managing and conserving this complex biome. First, repeated Pleistocene glacial advances along the coast fragmented species, leaving clear genetic signatures and a strongly diversified fauna. Organisms recolonized the coast following deglaciation. from multiple northern (Beringia), southern (West Coast and Continental) or North Pacific Coastal refugia. Several species are composed of multiple, genetically distinctive lineages (in some cases, incipient or new species) due to independent colonization histories from distinct, divergent source populations. Second, the insular landscape of the Alexander Archipelago has produced highly endemic populations. These centers of endeinism should be thoughtfully managed as hotspots of lineage diversity. Until a better understanding of connectivity among these divergent populations is developed, each island should be considered an independent biological unit. Finally, industrial logging, mining, human encroachment, tourism, wildlife consumption, and invasive species should be stringently monitored and regulated with respect to impact on island endemics and ecosystems. A new conservation paradigm for the Tongass National Forest should be developed that is built around the recognition of the complexity of this incomparable island archipelago of the North Pacific. in particular, recognition of high diversity and endemism should be central to management plans.

AB d The aim of this work was to study the early influence of conventional tillage (CT) and no-tillage (NT) on arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal (AMF) propagules. A short 2-year-course crop rotation, i.e. trial consisting of a succession of wheat and oat, was studied in a typic Chilean Ultisol from the second to fourth year after the beginning of the experiment. Measurements included mycorrhizal characteristics and some soil properties in order to explain their influence on AMF propagules. Soil samples were taken yearly in autumn (fallow period) and in early spring (flowering). Significant differences in AMF hyphal length were observed between NT and CT in the first year, but such differences disappeared thereafter. No differences in metabolically active hyphae were obtained with wheat or oat under the two tillage systems. Mycorrhizal root colonization was always higher under NT than under CT. The number of AMF spores was also higher under NT than under CT, ranging from 158 to 641 spores per 100 cm(3). Twenty-two AMF species including eight Glomus spp., six Acaulospora spp., four Scutellospora spp., one Archaeospora sp., one Diversispora sp., one Entrophospora sp. and one Pacispora sp. were observed in both agro-ecosystems. Higher spore number of Acaulospora spp. was found under wheat than under oat and under CT than under NT, whilst more spores of Scutellospora spp. were observed under NT than under CT. From all mycorrhizal characteristics, spore number could be visualized as an early and useful indicator of the effect of tillage systems on mycorrhizal propagules in short-term experiments.

AB The evolution of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) molecular-weight fractions, DOC biodegradability (BDOC), DOC origin [fluorescence index (FI)], and enzyme activities between the stream waters (main and ephemeral channel) and ground waters (riparian and hillslope) were analyzed during the transition from drought to precipitation in a forested Mediterranean stream. After the first rains, DOC content in stream water reached its maximum value (10-18 mg L-1), being explained by the leaching of deciduous leaves accumulated on the stream bed during drought. During this period, the largest molecules (> 10 kDa), were the most biodegradable, as indicated by high BDOC values measured during storm events and high enzymatic activities (especially for leucine-aminopeptidase). DOC > 100 kDa was strongly immobilized (78%) at the stream-riparian interface, whereas the smallest molecules (< 1 kDa) were highly mobile and accumulated in ground waters, indicating their greater recalcitrance. Differential enzymatic patterns between compartments showed a fast utilization of polysaccharides in the flowing water but a major protein utilization in the ground water. The results of the FI indicated a more terrestrial origin of the larger molecules in the flowing water, also suggesting that transformation of material occurs through the stream-riparian interface. Microbial immobilization and fast utilization of the most biodegradable fraction at the stream-riparian interface is suggested as a relevant DOC retention mechanism just after initial recharging of the ground water compartment. Large and rapid DOC inputs entering the intermittent river system during the transition from drought to precipitation provide available N and C sources for the heterotrophs. Heterotrophs efficiently utilize these resources that were in limited supply during the period of drought. Such changes in C cycling may highlight possible changes in organic matter dynamics under the prediction of extended drying periods in aquatic ecosystems.

AB Recent molecular investigations of marine samples taken from different environments, including tropical, temperate and polar areas, as well as deep thermal vents, have revealed an unexpectedly high diversity of protists, some of them forming deep-branching clades within important lineages, such as the alveolates and heterokonts. Using the same approach on coastal samples, we have identified a novel group of protist small subunit (SSU) rDNA sequences that do not correspond to any phylogenetic group previously identified. Comparison with other sequences obtained from cultures of heterotrophic protists showed that the environmental sequences grouped together with Telonema, a genus known since 1913 but of uncertain taxonomic affinity. Phylogenetic analyses using four genes (SSU, Hsp90, alpha-tubulin and beta-tubulin), and accounting for gamma- and covarion-distributed substitution rates, revealed Telonema as a distinct group of species branching off close to chromist lineages. Consistent with these gene trees, Telonema possesses ultrastructures revealing both the distinctness of the group and the evolutionary affinity to chromist groups. Altogether, the data suggest that Telonema constitutes a new eukaryotic phylum, here defined as Telonemia, possibly representing a key clade for the understanding of the early evolution of bikont protist groups, such as the proposed chromalveolate supergroup.

AB We analysed the genetic structure of seven nesting sites of the endangered green turtle (Chelonia mydas) in Africa using mitochondrial DNA control region sequences. Tissue samples were collected from 188 nesting females at six sites in West Africa and one in the Indian Ocean. A 488 bp fragment of the control region revealed 14 different haplotypes, 10 of which are previously undescribed. The most common haplotype (CM8) was observed in 157 individuals. All other haplotypes were closely related, except two divergent lineages: CM38, removed by four substitutions, and the three Indian Ocean haplotypes, distinguished by 31 substitutions. Significant differences in haplotype and nucleotide diversity were observed between Atlantic rookeries and among ocean basins. Analysis of molecular variance revealed high levels of differentiation between the Atlantic and the Indian Ocean populations but a much shallower Atlantic substructuring. Green turtle population genetic structure is thought to have been shaped by a dynamic succession of extinction and recolonisation of rookeries, by natal homing and occasional breakdown in nest-site fidelity. Mismatch distributions of pairwise differences between haplotypes at each rookery were found to be consistent with recent population expansion. We argue that demographic histories can be explained by scenarios at several temporal scales, including geological events, sea level fluctuations and more recent patterns of exploitation. We discuss management and conservation implications of our results for these threatened populations, identifying two ESUs (one in the Atlantic and one in the Indian ocean) and three MUs within the Atlantic.

AB Increasing our understanding of the factors regulating seasonal changes in rice canopy carbon gain (C-gain: daily net photosynthesis - night respiration) under elevated CO2 concentrations ([CO2]) will reduce our uncertainty in predicting future rice yields and assist in the development of adaptation strategies.
   In this study we measured CO2 exchange from rice (Oryza sativa) canopies grown at c. 360 and 690 mu mol mol(-1)[CO2] in growth chambers continuously over three growing seasons.
   Stimulation of C-gain by elevated [CO2] was 22-79% during vegetative growth, but decreased to between -12 and 5% after the grain-filling stage, resulting in a 7-22% net enhancement for the whole season.
   The decreased stimulation of C-gain resulted mainly from decreased canopy net photosynthesis and partially from increased respiration. A decrease in canopy photosynthetic capacity was noted where leaf nitrogen (N) decreased. The effect of elevated [CO2] on leaf area was generally small, but most dramatic under ample N conditions; this increased the stimulation of whole-season C-gain. These results suggest that a decrease in C-gain enhancement following elevated CO2 levels is difficult to avoid, but that careful management of nitrogen levels can alter the whole-season C-gain enhancement.

AB Phylogenetic studies of dinoflagellates are often conducted using rDNA sequences. In analyses to date, the monophyly of some of the major lineages of dinoflagellates remain to be demonstrated. There are several reasons for this uncertainty, one of which may be the use of models of evolution that may not closely fit the data. We constructed and examined alignments of SSU and partial LSU rRNA along with a concatenated alignment of the two molecules. The alignments showed several characteristics that may confound phylogeny reconstruction: paired helix (stem) regions that contain non-independently evolving sites, high levels of compositional heterogeneity among some of the sequences, high levels of incompatibility (homoplasy), and rate heterogeneity among sites. Taking into account these confounding factors, we analysed the data and found that the Gonyaulacales, a well-supported clade, may be the most recently diverged order. Other supported orders were, in the analysis based on SSU, the Suessiales and the Dinophysiales; however, the Gymnodiniales and Prorocentrales appeared to be polyphyletic. The Peridiniales without Heterocapsa species appeared as a monophyletic group in the analysis based on LSU; however, the support was low. The concatenated alignment did not provide a better phylogenetic resolution than the single gene alignments. (c) 2005 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB We report the nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and carbon (C) stoichiometry for each of the five organ-types (leaves, aerial stems, reproductive organs, roots, and tubers) of 17 actively growing Eranthis hyemalis plants differing in size (as measured in g C). We also report the N, P, and C stoichiometry of 20 winterized tubers, which are the only perennial organs of this species. Comparisons between whole-plant and winterized N/C and P/C levels indicate that N was resorbed from aerial organs and stored in tubers by the end of the growing season. Leaves were substantial reservoirs for N and P. With few exceptions, N scaled isometrically with respect to C for each organ-type, whereas P scaled as the 3/4 power of C. Thus, N is proportional to P-3/4 which is proportional to C regardless of organ-type. Additionally, annual growth rate G of shoots (leaves and aerial stems) scaled as the -3 power of leaf N/P quotients such that G was proportional to the 3/4 power of leaf P. We suggest that these scaling relationships (together with previously reported allometric trends across herbaceous species) show that growth is constrained by organ-specific N and P allocation patterns (presumably to proteins and ribosomes. respectively).

AB This study describes and analyses the local knowledge held by Brazilian and Australian fishers about the ecology (feeding habits, habitats, migratory movements), and the reproduction of Pomatomus saltatrix (Pomatomidae), which is an important fish species to artisanal fishers from both countries. It aims to address differences and similarities between information provided by the two groups of fishers, comparing such information with published biological data about this fish species. Data were, obtained interviewing fishers using standardized questionnaires. The surveyed coastal fishers were the caicaras from Buzios Island, at the southeastern Brazilian coast (Atlantic Ocean) and the aborigines (indigenous Australians) from North Stradbroke Island in the Moreton Bay, eastern Australian coast (Pacific Ocean). We interviewed, respectively. 39 and 18 fishers in Buzios and in North Stradbroke Island. The information provided by the fishers included differences between them with respect to habitat preferences and time of reproduction of P. saltatrix. Such differences may be due to environmental differences between the two sites. as well as to inter-population variations in reproductive peaks of this fish species. However. both groups of fishers mentioned similar feeding habitats and migratory movements of P saltatrix, suggesting general patterns. Local ecological knowledge held by both groups agrees with available scientific literature about this fish species, providing hypotheses to be investigated through biological research. The present survey highlights some contributions that Brazilian and Australian fishers' local knowledge may give to local management of P saltatrix. such as to improve scientific knowledge and to promote cooperation and dialogue between fishers and scientists.

AB A number of contemporary forest productivity models use some variation of a growth efficiency (epsilon) approach. Typically, these models predict production (aboveground net primary production, ANPP in units of dry mass biomass per unit of area per unit of time) as the product of two terms: radiation use efficiency (epsilon, in units of dry mass biomass per megajoule of photosynthetically active radiation [PAR] intercepted or absorbed by the plant canopy) and the sum of PAR intercepted or absorbed by the canopy (Phi(par), in units of megajoules per unit of radiation area per unit of time). Predicting productivity in a biologically realistic manner requires an understanding of how model components are affected by natural and anthropogenic environmental factors, as well as other influences such as aging or stand development. We measured or calculated all components of the epsilon model (aboveground woody biomass increment, I-WB; foliage biomass increment, I-FB; aboveground net primary production, ANPP; leaf area index, LAI; Phi(par); and aboveground radiation use efficiency, epsilon(A)) from ages 4 to 18 yr in loblolly and slash pine stands in north-central Florida grown under replicated fertilizer and understory vegetation control treatments that induced a large gradient in soil nutrient availability. Treatments impacted all measured components, which in turn led to strong responses in aboveground radiation use efficiency. Age 6-9 yr epsilon(A), averaged across species, ranged from 0.78 g/MJ to 0.83 g/MJ in treatments receiving fertilizer or vegetation control vs. 0.53 g/MJ in untreated plots. Stand developmental processes modified these responses, however, with epsilon(A), declining by over 40% in treated plots from age 6-9 yr to age 15-16 yr. Variation in epsilon(A) in both species was linked to development of stand basal area (BA), with a positive, linear relationship between e, and BA for values of BA < 18 M-2/ha and a declining, linear relationship for values of BA > 18 M-2/ha. Loblolly pine epsilon(A) was positively correlated with foliar nitrogen concentration, [N]. These data highlight the dynamic nature of epsilon(A) and suggest that both stand developmental and nutritional processes drive changes in ANPP and epsilon(A) in southern pines.

TI The ivory trade and elephant conservation

AB In response to significant elephant population declines in the 1970s and 1980s because of poaching for ivory, the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) banned the international trade in Asian and African elephant species by listing them on Appendix I in 1973 and 1989, respectively. Many southern African countries disagreed with the African elephant trade ban and have continued to argue against it since the mid-1980s. They maintain that their governments practise sound wildlife management policies and actions and, as a consequence, their national elephant populations have reached unsustainable size. They argue that they should not be penalized because other countries cannot manage their wildlife. Further, they say they need the proceeds from ivory and other by-product sales to finance conservation efforts. In 1997, the CITES Conference of Parties voted to allow Botswana, Namibia and Zimbabwe to auction off 50 tonnes of government ivory stockpiles to Japanese traders on a one-off experimental basis, which took place in 1999. Ivory trade opponents allege that this sale stimulated ivory demand, resulting in a surge of elephant poaching. Nevertheless, CITES voted again in 2002 to allow Botswana, Namibia and South Africa to auction off another 60 tonnes of ivory after May 2004. Trade opponents have launched an active campaign to prevent the sales, warning that they could provoke a renewed elephant holocaust. This paper reviews available quantitative evidence on ivory trade and elephant killing to evaluate the arguments of the ivory trade proponents and opponents. The evidence supports the view that the trade bans resulted generally in lower levels of ivory market scale and elephant poaching than prevailed prior to 1990. There is little evidence to support claims that the 1999 southern African ivory auctions stimulated ivory demand or elephant poaching. Levels of elephant poaching and illegal ivory trading in a country are more likely to be related to wildlife management practices, law enforcement and corruption than to choice of CITES appendix listings and consequent extent of trade restrictions. Elephant conservation and public welfare can be better served by legal ivory trade than by a trade ban, but until demand for ivory can be restrained and various monitoring and regulation measures are put into place it is premature for CITES to permit ivory sales.

AB 1 Milicia regia (Moraceae) is a dioecious light-demanding (Pioneer) timber tree of West Africa. Experiments in shadehouses were used to examine the influence of light and soil source (beneath and away from conspecific adults) on mortality and growth of its seedlings in relation to fungal pathogens and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) colonization.
   2 The experiment in Ghana included treatments for light (2% and 20% of unshaded irradiance), three soil sources (under female, under male and 200 m distant from adults), and two different fungicide treatments.
   3 The results showed significant effects of irradiance, soil source and fungicide on both seedling mortality and accumulated biomass. Biomass was greater and mortality reduced at higher irradiance. Fungicide application reduced mortality in 2% irradiance, but had no significant effects at 20%, although AM infection of seedlings grown in soils from beneath adults was severely reduced. Mortality was greatest in soil from beneath female trees and least in soil distant from adult conspecifics. However, biomass in 20% irradiance was greater in soil from beneath females, possibly because of enhanced AM colonization: seedlings had a significantly higher percentage root length colonized by AM fungi beneath adult conspecifics, and biomass accumulation was significantly correlated with root length colonized by AM fungi.
   4 There were significant interactions amongst light, soil source and fungicide treatments that attest to the complexity of spatial effects on seedling establishment in tropical forest. Whilst there was clear evidence of pathogen-mediated effects that provides support for Janzen-Connell spacing mechanisms, and escape from the parent tree increases the chances of arriving in gaps, spatial differences in AM fungal communities may act in the opposite direction and enhance seedling growth close to adult conspecifics.
   5 The complexity of interactions between abiotic and biotic factors and the way in which these factors can vary spatially to affect seedling recruitment may be an important factor contributing to the maintenance of tree species diversity in tropical forests.

AB Polyandry is a reproductive strategy whose occurrence has been explained in terms of both direct and indirect benefits to females. Among the direct benefits, a positive correlation between female remating and fecundity, mediated by receipt of nuptial gifts, is considered a major factor maintaining polyandry. However, a careful inspection of available studies reveals that such a correlation is not universal. In this comparative study of Lepidopterans we analysed two-way contingence tables based on 60 studies, and performed a meta-analysis of 39 studies to document associations between (1) the mating pattern (monandrous or polyandrous); (2) the methodological approach used (experimental or descriptive); and (3) the effect of female remating on fecundity. All three variables were significantly associated. Studies where remating increased fecundity were more often established in polyandrous species and when the experimental method was used. However, the experimental method also tended to be utilised more often for polyandrous species. Meta-analysis confirmed these 'vote-count'-based associations. We were also able to differentiate the relative effects of mating pattern and methodology on the remating-fecundity relationship. In polyandrous species, remating increased fecundity irrespective of the test method. In monandrous species, however, conclusions were method-dependent: fecundity did not increase with remating in descriptive studies. We discuss some biological and non-biological factors that may account for these heterogeneous results. We suggest that greater attention must be paid to variation among females in their propensity to mate multiply. The mating pattern of a species will influence the conclusions drawn from experimental and descriptive studies of the relationship between polyandry and fecundity because it covaries with the proportion of naturally monandrous females in that species.

AB We used a combination of two models, DISTRIB and SHIFT, to estimate potential migration of five tree species into suitable habitat due to climate change over the next 100 years. These species, currently confined to the eastern half of the United States and not extending into Canada, are Diospyros virginiana (persimmon), Liquidambar styraciflua (sweetgum), Oxydendrum arboreum (sourwood), Pinus taeda (loblolly pine), and Quercus falcata var. falcata (southern red oak). DISTRIB uses a statistical approach to assess potential suitable habitat under equilibrium of 2 x CO2. SHIFT uses a cellular automata approach to estimate migration and is driven primarily by the abundance of the species near the boundary, forest density inside and outside of the boundary, and distance between cells. For each cell outside the current boundary, SHIFT creates an estimate of the probability that each unoccupied target cell will become colonized over 100 years. By evaluating the probability of colonization within the potential 'new' suitable habitat, we can estimate the proportion of new habitat that might be colonized within a century. This proportion is low (< 15%) for all five species, suggesting that there is a serious lag between the potential movement of suitable habitat and the potential for the species to migrate into the new habitat. However, humans could hasten the migration of certain species by physically moving the propagules, especially for certain rare species that are unable to move sufficiently through fragmented landscapes, or even more common species, e.g., beech, that have lost many of their animal dispersers.

AB The Amazon river dolphin, genus Inia, is endemic to the major river basins of northern South America. No previous studies have focused on the genetic structure of this genus. In this work, 96 DNA samples from specimens of this genus were collected in the Orinoco basin (four rivers), the Putumayo River, a tributary of the Colombian Amazon and the Mamore, and the Tijamuchi and Ipurupuru rivers in the Bolivian Amazon. These samples were used to amplify a fragment of 400 bp of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region. In addition, 38 of these samples were also used to sequence 600 bp of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene. The analysis of the population structure subdivision with an analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) revealed important aspects about the genetic structure of Inia groups from these three geographically separate regions. By comparing the control region DNA and cytochrome b sequences, distinct types of nonshared haplotypes were observed. The net genetic divergence of control region sequences was 6.53% between the Orinoco and Bolivian rivers, 5.32% between the Putumayo and Bolivian rivers, and 2.50% between the Orinoco and Putumayo rivers. For the cytochrome b gene, these values were 2.48%, 2.98%, and 0.06%, respectively. The nucleotide sequences were analyzed phylogenetically using several genetic distance matrices and applying neighbor-joining, maximum likelihood, and maximum parsimony procedures. The results support the proposal to subdivide the Inia genus into at least two evolutionarily significant units: one confined to the Bolivian river basin and the other widely distributed across the Amazon and Orinoco basins.

AB We sequenced parts of three mitochondrial genes in 67 great spotted woodpeckers Dendrocopos major taken from 17 sites across Eurasia and Japan. Two groups, differing by ca. 3% sequence divergence, were determined to have had independent evolutionary histories: samples from the southeast (Sakhalin, Primor'e, Hokkaido), and the rest of Eurasia. The southeastern group corresponds to the subspecies D. M. japonicus, which will likely merit species status upon study of all subspecies; at present it should be considered an evolutionarily significant unit. From the United Kingdom to the Russian North Pacific, no phylogeographic divisions were found, which is likely a result of recent range expansion following retreat of permafrost after the last ice age.

AB Conservation of biodiversity will necessitate choices among areas, taxa, and land-use parterns. Lack of data on distribution and pattern in biodiversity makes these difficult decisions even more problematic for those charged with the conservation and sustainable use of the diversity of life. Quantitative methods have promise in helping with this task in that they allow people to make their values explicit, and they also allow representation and comparison of many different types of data.
   In this article I examine patterns of species richness and range-size rarity, or endemism, in the Neotropics with a data set from the genus Solanum (Solanaccae). Distribution data for 180 species of forest-dwelling solanums were analyzed. Patterns of species richness, range-size rarity (endemism), and several area-selection methods were examined. Montane areas are relatively rich both in all species and in endemic species, with maximal peaks in the Andes. The peak of species richness coincides with the domain (i.e., continental) midpoint (9degrees30' S latitude), suggesting that the pattern observed may be partly due to the geometry of species ranges. The Solanum results are compared with those obtained for other taxonomic groups in the Neotropics, and problems with quantitative data sets in conservation are discussed. Collecting deficit, parochial taxonomy.. and habitat destruction, both historical and current, are all factors that will affect the utility of such analyses. It is clear that if conservation is to work on the ground, we need to know more about what occurs in the montane Neotropics and that continued work at a basic taxonomic level is essential to our ultimate ability to conserve biological diversity.

AB Although the main theoretical framework determining how to exploit populations was derived almost 50 years ago, overexploitation is common. I review 10 major concepts underlying the regulation of exploitation: population increase can be exploited; density dependence is essential; quantifying density dependence is exceedingly difficult; sustainable exploitation involves reducing population size; population growth rate is usually mismeasured; sustainability has many conflicting definitions and the choice depends upon the objectives; it is better to monitor the population than the harvest; quotas are unstable; increasing effort is simple, reducing it is painful; exploit conservatively. I then give a brief account of each of the nine main methods that are used to determine sustainable exploitation and the uses, advantages and limitations of each. The nine techniques are: surplus production models, yield per recruit models, Robinson and Redford model, linking yield to recruitment and mortality, adjusting to population changes, comparing demography across sites, reducing to a fixed fraction of unexploited population size, full population models and adaptive management.

AB A field experiment was conducted to characterize root growth and water uptake from soil layers with different N levels by upland rice (Oryza sativa L.) and maize (Zea mays L.) under severe water stress (no water supply) and mild water stress (intermittent water supply). Under mild stress conditions, medium N application led to the increase of the total root length but to the decrease of the root length/leaf area ratio compared with the no-N treatment in rice. Water was extracted from soil layers in a pattern approximately proportional to the root length distribution under mild stress. Both in rice and maize, a major portion of the water was extracted from the 0-20 cm depth. Application of N increased the total mater uptake, which was attributed to the greater root length and higher specific water extraction rate per unit length of root. Specific water extraction rate can vary to some extent, depending on the transpiration demand of the shoots. In rice, mater uptake, dry matter production in shoot, and root length were largely suppressed under severe stress compared with mild stress. In maize, water uptake under severe stress was maintained at a level similar to that under mild stress. This was attributed to the higher extraction from the deep soil below the 40 cm depth, which was supported by the increased root distribution and increased specific water extraction rate per unit root length at the depth under severe stress compared with mild stress. The lower water-capturing capacity of rice than that of maize under severe stress was characterized by a lower response to the enhancement of the morphological growth of the roots in deeper soil layers and the limited ability of water extraction per unit length of root, especially in the deeper layers.

AB We tested the published hypothesis of a Gondwanan origin for the overwhelmingly northern hemisphere aphid parasitoids (Aphidiinae) as follows: (i) finding their sister group by a phylogenetic analysis of the entire Braconidae (Insecta: Hymenoptera) using sequence data from approximately 500 bp fragments of both the nuclear 28S (D2 region) and mitochondrial 16S rDNA genes, (ii) using this sister-group relationship and the more informative 28S D2 gene to estimate the phylogeny of the Aphidiinae and (iii) estimating the ancestral distribution for the Aphidiinae using maximum-likelihood and maximum parsimony methods. Both methods indicated a Gondwanan origin.

AB 1 When a species influences conditions at a site to promote recruitment of conspecifics, the community may remain dominated by that species until the next major disturbance. We examined the occurrence of possible mechanisms for such a positive feedback in one community where it may be important: forests dominated by eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis).
   2 Intact soil divots were collected from a hemlock stand in central Massachusetts, USA, and placed in shade-houses at either 1.5% or 60% full sun. Soil was amended with nitrogen (5 g m(-2) year(-1)), lime (1 kg m(-2) year(-1); to increase soil pH) or left untreated. Emergence, survival and growth of seedlings arising from the soil seed bank were subsequently monitored.
   3 Light availability had a very large influence on seedling regeneration dynamics. Birch (Betula spp.) seedlings were most sensitive of all species to light availability, with low light reducing emergence by 43% and substantially decreasing seedling growth (by 99%) and survival (by 94%). In contrast, light treatments had smaller effects on performance of other species [hemlock and white pine (Pinus strobus)]. Birch survival was also increased by nitrogen addition, but only in low light. Liming had only marginal effects on seedling performance.
   4 Differential seedling responses to resource availability led to dominance of final seedling communities by hemlock in low light, unamended soils (i.e., under conditions naturally found in hemlock stands), but by birch in high light, as well as in low light, nitrogen-amended soils.
   5 Positive feedbacks in hemlock stands are mediated both by availability of light and nitrogen, and by species' life-history strategies.

AB Competition is considered an important force in structuring plant communities and in governing niche relations, but communities recovering from disturbance, may be less governed by species interactions and less orderly organized. To address this issue, we studied species richness, abundance and patterns of association between plant species at three spatial scales (1 m(2), 1/25 m(2), 1/625 m(2)) in two ombrotrophic mires in east-central Sweden. One was at a secondary successional stage following peat extraction 50 yr ago and the other was undisturbed. Feat extraction leads to a change in hydrology which is slowly restored by the formation of new peat. Niche breadth and niche overlap along the gradient of height above the water table were calculated for the five common Sphagnum species occurring at both mires in an attempt to better understand differences in species co-occurrence at each mire.
   Species cover differed between the mires, and the number of species per plot was higher in the undisturbed community at all scales, suggesting that the degree of species intermingling was greater than at the harvested site. At all scales, the number of non-random associations was higher, and niche overlap lower among ecologically similar species (e.g. hollow Sphagnum species) in the undisturbed mire. These differences indicate that random events are important in colonization, and that biotic interactions between neighbours later result in a higher degree of non-randomness.
   In addition, we surveyed a number of abandoned peat pit sites to test the effect of disturbance for species composition at a regional scale. Ombrotrophic peat pits contained several Sphagnum species normally associated with minerotrophic mires, and species of wooded mires occurred frequently in pear pits, making them more species-rich than undisturbed bogs. There were also Sphagnum species new to, or rare in, this part of Sweden which indicates effective long-distance dispersal. Even 50 yr after peat extraction had ceased, the vegetation had not recovered to its original composition.

AB To describe the genetic structure of Hector's dolphin (Cephalorhynchus hectori) populations, we used the polymerase chain reaction to amplify and sequence a 360 base-pair fragment of the mitochondrial DNA control region from 34 beachcast or gillnet-caught specimens. Variation in these sequences identified 11 distinct haplotypes differing from one another by 0.28-1.67% and by an average of 4.47% from the closely related Commerson's dolphin. The genealogical relationship of these haplotypes showed a strong concordance with the geographic origins of the samples. An analysis of variance modified for molecular data showed that 74% of the sequence variation could be explained by the three primary sampling regions: the North Island, the west coast of the South Island, an dth east coast of the South Island. Such a marked segregation of maternal lineages across a small geographic range is unusual among cetaceans. The low rate of female dispersal, as indicated by this mitochondrial DNA structure, could increase the vulnerability of local populations to extinction due to fisheries-related mortality.

AB Naturally regenerated Scots pines (Pinus sylvestris L.), aged 28-30 years old, were grown in open-top chambers and subjected in situ to three ozone (O-3) regimes, two concentrations of CO2, and a combination of O-3 and CO2 treatments from 15 April to 15 September for two growing seasons (1994 and 1995), The gas exchanges of current-year and 1-year-old shoots were measured, along with the nitrogen content of needles, In order to investigate the factors underlying modifications in photosynthesis, five parameters linked to photosynthetic performance and three to stomatal conductance were determined, Elevated O-3 concentrations led to a significant decline in the CO2 compensation point (I*), maximum RuP2-saturated rate of carboxylation (V-emax), maximum rate of electron transport (J(max)) maximum stomatal conductance (g(smax)) and sensitivity of stomatal conductance to changes in leaf-to-air vapour pressure difference (partial derivative g(s)/partial derivative D-v) in both shoot-age classes, However, the effect of elevated O-3 concentrations on the respiration rate in light (R-d) was dependent on shoot age, Elevated CO2 (700 mu mol mol(-1)) significantly decreased J(max) and g(smax) but increased R-d in 1-year-old shoots and the partial derivative(s)/partial derivative D-v in both shoot-age classes, The interactive effects of O-3 and CO2 on some key parameters (e.g. V-emax and J(max)) were significant. This may be closely related to regulation of the maximum stomatal conductance and stomatal sensitivity induced by elevated CO2. As a consequence, the injury induced by O-3 was reduced through decreased ozone uptake in 1-year-old shoots, but not in the current-year shoots, Compared to ambient O-3 concentration, reduced O-3 concentrations (charcoal-filtered air) did not lead to significant changes in any of the measured parameters, Compared to the control treatment, calculations showed that elevated O-3 concentrations decreased the apparent quantum yield by 35% and by 18%, and the maximum rate of photosynthesis by 21% and by 29% in the current-year and 1-year-old shoots, respectively, Changes in the nitrogen content of needles resulting from the various treatments were associated with modifications in photosynthetic components.

AB An hypothesis was formulated that phosphorus (P) partitioning in tissues of C-4 leaves would permit C-4 plants to resist P deficiency better than C, plants. To test this hypothesis, 12 C-3, C-4, and C-3-C-4 intermediate species were grown at adequate, deficient, and severely deficient P supply in a solid-phase-buffered sand culture system to characterize photosynthetic and growth responses. Species differed considerably in response to P stress. The growth of C-3 species was more sensitive to P supply than C-4 species, but C-3 and C-4 species had similar photosynthetic P use efficiency, and C-4 species did not have low leaf P content, contrary to our hypothesis. In fact, leaf photosynthetic rates were not correlated with growth responses. Moncots had lower leaf P content and better maintenance of leaf production under P stress than dicots, because of greater inhibition of branching (dicots) than of tillering (monocots). The most P efficient species in this survey was Brachiaria, a C-4 monocot that increased root biomass allocation under stress while maintaining P allocation to the shoot. It is concluded that C-4 species are not inherently more P efficient than C-3 species, but that monocots are more P efficient than dicots, because of contrasting P and biomass allocation under stress.

AB Xanthophyll-cycle pigments and photosynthetic capacity (PSmax) were analyzed in 25 species from different light environments (canopy, gap, understory) within a Panamanian tropical forest. (1) Sun-exposed leaves of canopy tree species showed the highest photosynthetic capacities and largest xanthophyll-cycle pools (violaxanthin, antheraxanthin, zeaxanthin) of about 87 mmol mol(-1) chlorophyll with only small amounts of alpha-carotene [about 7 mmol mol(-1) chlorophyll = 8% of total (alpha+beta) carotene pool]. Under high natural photon flux densities (PFDs) canopy leaves rapidly converted up to 96% of the xanthophyll-cycle pool into zeaxanthin. The back reaction to violaxanthin occurred much faster in low light than in complete darkness. At the end of the night, zeaxanthin still accounted for, on average, 14% of the total xanthophyll-cycle pigments. (2) Leaves of gap plants had intermediate values of PSmax and a 43% lower total carotenoid content than canopy leaves. The average size of the xanthophyll-cycle pool was 35 mmol mol(-1) chlorophyll, and alpha-carotene accounted for up to 66% of the total (alpha+beta) carotene pool. Under high light conditions gap plants converted, on average, 86% of the xanthophyll-cycle pigments into zeaxanthin. The back reaction, following a decrease in ambient PFD, was slower than the forward reaction. At the end of the night, zeaxanthin accounted for, on average, 7% of the xanthophyll-cycle pigments in gap plants. (3) Understory plants showed the lowest values of PSmax and the smallest xanthophyll-cycle pool of about 22 mmol mol(-1) chlorophyll. alpha-Carotene accounted for up to 70% of total carotene. The conversion of xanthophyll-cycle pigments into zeaxanthin was negligible during short sunflecks of 1-2 min duration and PFDs up to about 400 mu mol m(-2) s(-1). At predawn, leaves of understory plants rarely contained any detectable zeaxanthin. Aechmea magdalenae, an understory CAM plant, showed exceptionally high rates of PSmax per unit leaf area compared to sympatric C-3 understory species.

AB 1 The performance of seedlings of Acer saccharum, Fraxinus americana, Gleditsia triacanthos and Prunus serotina was examined in eight old-field vegetation patch types and in control plots with no competition. Measurements of seedling gas exchange, water potential, foliar N, and specific leaf area were related to microenvironmental conditions and to seedling growth and survival.
   2 Among vegetated patch types, predawn leaf water potentials and midday photosynthetic rates of the tree seedlings were highest in the short-statured and shallow-rooted patches of Poa pratensis, and lowest under established trees and shrubs where both soil moisture and subcanopy irradiance are reduced.
   3 For seedlings of all tree species, photosynthetic rates per unit leaf area averaged 21-28% of that measured in control seedlings free of competition. Irradiance and photosynethesis both varied significantly among patch types, and photosynthesis was more strongly correlated with irradiance than with other variables.
   4 In all species, photosynthesis under full light was strongly correlated with photosynthesis measured under ambient light. Ambient photosynethesis most closely approached photosynethetic capacity in late-successional species (Acer > Fraxinus > Prunus > Gleditsia). Shade-tolerance thereby enhances the potential for late-successional species to invade established plant communities.
   5 The ratio of net photosynthesis to stomatal conductance in tree seedlings was decreased in competitive environments dominated by Solidago and other fast-growing herbs. Reduced water use efficiency appears to be caused by competitively induced nitrogen limitations. Some competitive environments thus reduce both soil moisture and photosynthetic water use efficiency of tree seedlings.
   6 Measurements of photosynthesis and foliar nitrogen are good indicators of long-term seedling growth, but not of survival. The complex interaction of light, moisture and nitrogen availability varies distinctively among old-field vegetation patches, and invading tree species differ in their ability to cope with these compound stresses. Such differences can explain differential tree seedling growth rates in old-field vegetation, but the densities of trees found germinating and surviving from year to year depend on other factors.

AB The amount of photosynthetically-active photon flux density incident upon a leaf and the nitrogen content of that leaf strongly affect the photosynthetic carbon gain of that leaf.  Therefore, the canopy structure of a stand, affecting the light climate in the canopy, and the leaf nitrogen distribution pattern in the canopy, affect the carbon gain of the whole canopy.  This review discusses the results of studies directed to this problem and obtained so far in open and in dense canopies of stands of herbaceous, monocotyledonous or dicotyledonous, plants in their growing or flowering stages.  It is found that the leaf nitrogen distribution pattern in the canopy is vertically non-uniform, and in dense stands more strongly so than in open stands.  The leaf nitrogen distribution pattern in most canopies closely approaches an optimal pattern in that it maximizes whole canopy potential carbon gain as calculated for the actual total leaf nitrogen content and leaf area index of the stand.  The resulting increase in potential carbon gain as compared to a uniform leaf nitrogen distribution pattern is considerable and it is larger in dense stands than in open stands.  For at least some dense stands simulation studies show that with the available total leaf nitrogen content, whole canopy carbon gains could still be considerable higher had a lower leaf area index been developed.

TI ROOT QUANTIFICATION BY EDGE DISCRIMINATION USING A DESK-TOP SCANNER
SO AGRONOMY JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
ID IMAGE ANALYZER; LENGTH
AB Root characterization methods are constrained by one or more of the following factors:  cost, limited resolution, or time of analysis.  Most length-determination methods are based on the line-intersect principle.  An alternate method using a flatbed scanner and a microcomputer was developed.  Algorithms were developed to estimate root area, length, and diameter (mean root width).  Two-dimensional area is estimated by summing the number of pixels representing a single or group of gray scales.  Length and width are calculated as a function of the area, the number of edge pixels, and the number of pixels on diagonal edges.  Human hair, plastic line, and root samples, with widths from 0.13 to 1.65 mm and lengths near 100 cm, were measured manually and with image analysis.  Mean lengths of four repeated scans after reorientation were within 0.4 to 1.2% of manually determined lengths.  Four repeated scans (118 pixels cm-1) of reoriented roots yielded length estimates with C.V.'s from 0.31 to 2.18% on low density samples (< 500 cm).  At higher densities, increased frequency of adjoining edges resulted in underestimated lengths and overestimated widths.  A correction for these inaccuracies, based on the determination of mean width on a low density subsample, provided accurate root length estimates up to 10 m.  Overall, this method overcomes limitations of other procedures such as (i) the requirement for random orientation of the sample necessary with the line-intersect method, (ii) reliance on a comparison to a standard curve from non-root objects, and (iii) inadequate imaging resolution.

AB Understanding the importance of biotic interactions in driving the distribution and abundance of species is a central goal of plant ecology. Early vascular plants likely colonized land occupied by biocrusts - photoautotrophic, surface-dwelling soil communities comprised of cyanobacteria, bryophytes, lichens and fungi - suggesting biotic interactions between biocrusts and plants have been at play for some 2,000 million years. Today, biocrusts coexist with plants in dryland ecosystems worldwide, and have been shown to both facilitate or inhibit plant species performance depending on ecological context. Yet, the factors that drive the direction and magnitude of these effects remain largely unknown. We conducted a meta-analysis of plant responses to biocrusts using a global dataset encompassing 1,004 studies from six continents. Meta-analysis revealed there is no simple positive or negative effect of biocrusts on plants. Rather, plant responses differ by biocrust composition and plant species traits and vary across plant ontogeny. Moss-dominated biocrusts facilitated, while lichen-dominated biocrusts inhibited overall plant performance. Plant responses also varied among plant functional groups: C-4 grasses received greater benefits from biocrusts compared to C-3 grasses, and plants without N-fixing symbionts responded more positively to biocrusts than plants with N-fixing symbionts. Biocrusts decreased germination but facilitated growth of non-native plant species. Synthesis. Results suggest that interspecific variation in plant responses to biocrusts, contingent on biocrust type, plant traits, and ontogeny can have strong impacts on plant species performance. These findings have important implications for understanding biocrust contributions to plant productivity and community assembly processes in ecosystems worldwide.

AB Fine root decomposition constitutes a critical yet poorly understood flux of carbon and nutrients in terrestrial ecosystems. Here, we present the first large-scale synthesis of species trait effects on the early stages of fine root decomposition at both global and local scales. Based on decomposition rates for 279 plant species across 105 studies and 176 sites, we found that mycorrhizal association and woodiness are the best categorical traits for predicting rates of fine root decomposition. Consistent positive effects of nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations and negative effects of lignin concentration emerged on decomposition rates within sites. Similar relationships were present across sites, along with positive effects of temperature and moisture. Calcium was not consistently related to decomposition rate at either scale. While the chemical drivers of fine root decomposition parallel those of leaf decomposition, our results indicate that the best plant functional groups for predicting fine root decomposition differ from those predicting leaf decomposition.

AB Apomixis, the asexual reproduction via seed, has many potential applications for plant breeding by maintaining desirable genotypes over generations. Since most major crops do not express natural apomixis, it is useful to understand the origin and maintenance of apomixis in natural plant systems. Here, we review the state of knowledge on origin, establishment and maintenance of natural apomixis. Many studies suggest that hybridization, either on diploid or polyploid cytotypes, is a major trigger for the formation of unreduced female gametophytes, which represents the first step toward apomixis, and must be combined to parthenogenesis, the development of an unfertilized egg cell. Nevertheless, fertilization of endosperm is still needed for most apomictic plants. Coupling of these three steps appears to be a major constraint for shifts to natural apomixis. Adventitious embryony is another developmental pathway toward apomixis. Establishment of a newly arisen apomictic lineage is often fostered by side-effects of polyploidy. Polyploidy creates an immediate reproductive barrier against the diploid parental and progenitor populations; it can cause a breakdown of genetic self-incompatibility (SI) systems which is needed to establish self-fertility of pseudogamous apomictic lineages; and finally, polyploidy could indirectly help to establish an apomictic cytotype in a novel ecological niche by increasing adaptive potentials of the plants. This step may be followed by a phase of diversification and range expansion, mostly described as geographical parthenogenesis. The utilization of apomixis in crops must consider the potential risks of pollen transfer and introgression into sexual crop fields, which might be overcome by using pollen-sterile or cleistogamous variants. Another risk is the escape into natural vegetation and potential invasiveness of apomictic plants which needs careful management and consideration of ecological conditions.

AB We summarize observed and expected impacts of hydroelectric dams on tropical fishes and fisheries through the lens of fish functional traits and consequences of shifting functional diversity for social-ecological systems. Following impoundment, stocks respond to environmental changes differently according to their functional traits, resulting in fairly predictable shifts in assemblage functional structure. The most vulnerable species are those with traits adaptive for habitats with fast flowing water, structural complexity, flood pulsing or those requiring connectivity across basins to complete their life cycle. Shifts in assemblage functional trait distributions are accompanied by reduced fishery yields and impacts to other ecosystem services. Research employing a functional traits approach should enhance assessment of impacts of impoundments on biodiversity, fisheries and ecosystem services, especially for data-deficient systems.

AB Respiration is a core biological process that has important implications for the biochemistry, physiology, and ecology of plants. The study of plant respiration is thus conducted from several different perspectives by a range of scientific disciplines with dissimilar objectives, such as metabolic engineering, crop breeding, and climate-change modelling. One aspect in common among the different objectives is a need to understand and quantify the variation in respiration across scales of biological organization. The central tenet of this review is that different perspectives on respiration can complement each other when connected. To better accommodate interdisciplinary thinking, we identify distinct mechanisms which encompass the variation in respiratory rates and functions across biological scales. The relevance of these mechanisms towards variation in plant respiration are explained in the context of five core principles: (1) respiration performs three distinct functions; (2) metabolic pathway flexibility underlies respiratory performance; (3) supply and demand interact over time to set respiration rates; (4) acclimation involves adjustments in enzyme capacities; and (5) respiration is a complex trait that helps to define, and is impacted by, plant lifestyle strategies. We argue that each perspective on respiration rests on these principles to varying degrees and that broader appreciation of how respiratory variation occurs can unite research across scales.

AB Ecological succession - how biological communities re-assemble and change over time following natural or anthropogenic disturbance - has been studied since the birth of ecology, and the resulting theoretical framework underpins many aspects of the discipline. Recently, the mechanistic basis of classic succession theory has been advanced by studies of plant and microbial interactions, functional traits, and retrogressive stages of ecosystem development. This special issue brings together a series of papers that highlight these contemporary novel approaches and how our understanding of ecological succession has advanced. Four key themes emerge from the issue: (a) generalizations about succession, (b) the influence of dispersal and habitat size on successional trajectories, (c) changes in plant functional traits during succession, and (d) belowground community interactions during long term during ecosystem development. Synthesis. The articles in the special issue highlight novel perspectives on succession theory, revealing the importance of historical contingency, disturbance severity, dispersal limitation, functional traits, and belowground community processes in determining patterns of ecosystem development. Together, they reinforce the importance of ecological succession in understanding the response of plant and microbial communities to disturbance in a changing world.

AB Species-level forecasts of distributional potential and likely distributional shifts, in the face of changing climates, have become popular in the literature in the past 20 years. Many refinements have been made to the methodology over the years, and the result has been an approach that considers multiple sources of variation in geographic predictions, and how that variation translates into both specific predictions and uncertainty in those predictions. Although numerous previous reviews and overviews of this field have pointed out a series of assumptions and caveats associated with the methodology, three aspects of the methodology have important impacts but have not been treated previously in detail. Here, we assess those three aspects: (1) effects of niche truncation on model transfers to future climate conditions, (2) effects of model selection procedures on future-climate transfers of ecological niche models, and (3) relative contributions of several factors (replicate samples of point data, general circulation models, representative concentration pathways, and alternative model parameterizations) to overall variance in model outcomes. Overall, the view is one of caution: although resulting predictions are fascinating and attractive, this paradigm has pitfalls that may bias and limit confidence in niche model outputs as regards the implications of climate change for species' geographic distributions.

AB It has long been recognized that primary foundation species (FS), such as trees and seagrasses, enhance biodiversity. Among the species facilitated are secondary FS, including mistletoes and epiphytes. Case studies have demonstrated that secondary FS can further modify habitat-associated organisms ('inhabitants'), but their net effects remain unknown. Here we assess how inhabitants, globally, are affected by secondary FS. We extracted and calculated 2,187 abundance and 397 richness Hedges' g effect sizes from 91 and 50 publications, respectively. A weighted meta-analysis revealed that secondary FS significantly enhanced the abundance and richness of inhabitants compared to the primary FS alone. This indirect facilitation arising through sequential habitat formation was consistent across environmental and experimental conditions. Complementary unweighted analyses on log response ratios revealed that the magnitude of these effects was similar to the global average strength of direct facilitation from primary foundation species and greater than the average strength of trophic cascades, a widely recognized type of indirect facilitation arising through sequential consumption. The finding that secondary FS enhance the abundance and richness of inhabitants has important implications for understanding the mechanisms that regulate biodiversity. Integrating secondary FS into conservation practice will improve our ability to protect biodiversity and ecosystem function.

AB The ecosystem services (ES) framework has potential to bring transdisciplinary teams together to achieve societal goals. Some label ES as "boundary objects" that help integrate diverse forms of knowledge across social groups and organizational scales. However, this classification masks complexities that arise from unique characteristics of ES types (i.e., provisioning, regulating, and cultural), which influence their ability to function as boundary objects. We argue that interpretive flexibility and material structures interact in distinct ways across ES types throughout a boundary object "life cycle." Viewing a 2015 U.S. federal memorandum as a catalyst, we critically evaluate the evolution of ES and its role as a boundary object. We propose that provisioning and regulating services are transitioning out of boundary object status, moving into a more standardized state. However, we anticipate that cultural services may continue to behave as boundary objects if collaborators maintain them as such. This shift in the functionality of ES as boundary objects is an important consideration for future research that attempts to reach across social worlds and disciplinary perspectives. We urge collaborations to rely on the most relevant disciplinary knowledge, rather than allowing the ease of standardized solutions to dictate the boundary of a given problem. (C) 2017 The Authors.

AB The connected nature of social-ecological systems has never been more apparent than in today's globalized world. The ecosystem service framework and associated ecosystem assessments aim to better inform the science-policy response to sustainability challenges. Such assessments, however, often overlook distant, diffuse and delayed impacts that are critical for global sustainability. Ecosystem-services science must better recognise the off-stage impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem services of place-based ecosystem management, which we term 'ecosystem service burdens'. These are particularly important since they are often negative, and have a potentially significant effect on ecosystem management decisions. Ecosystem-services research can better recognise these off-stage burdens through integration with other analytical approaches, such as life cycle analysis and risk-based approaches that better account for the uncertainties involved. We argue that off-stage ecosystem service burdens should be incorporated in ecosystem assessments such as those led by the Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Taking better account of these off-stage burdens is essential to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of cross-scale interactions, a prerequisite for any sustainability transition.

AB 1. A major challenge of current ecological research is to determine the responses of plant and animal communities and ecosystem processes to future environmental conditions. Ecosystems respond to climate change in complex ways, and the outcome may significantly depend on biodiversity.
   2. We studied the relative effects of enhanced drought and of plant species mixture on soil biota and on litter decomposition in a Mediterranean oak forest. We experimentally reduced precipitation, accounting for seasonal precipitation variability, and created a single-species litter (Quercus pubescens), a two-species litter mixture (Q. pubescens + Acer monspessulanum) and a three-species litter mixture (Q. pubescens + A. monspessulanum + Cotinus coggygria).
   3. In general, drier conditions affected decomposers negatively, directly by reducing fungal biomass and detritivorous mesofauna, and also indirectly by increasing the predation pressure on detritivorous mesofauna by predatory mesofauna. This is reflected under drier conditions in that Collembola abundance decreased more strongly than Acari abundance. One Collembola group (i.e. Neelipleona) even disappeared completely.
   4. Increased drought strongly decreased litter decomposition rates. Mixed litter with two and three plant species positively affected soil biota communities and led to a more efficient litter decomposition process, probably through a greater litter quality. Faster decomposition in mixed litter can thus compensate slower decomposition rates under drier condition.
   5. Synthesis. Our results highlight that, within our study system, drier climate strongly impacts on soil biodiversity and hence litter decomposition. Species-rich litter may mitigate such a decline in decomposition rates. Diverse plant communities should hence be maintained to reduce shifts in ecosystem functioning under climate change.

AB Understanding the temporal patterns of leaf traits is critical in determining the seasonality and magnitude of terrestrial carbon, water, and energy fluxes. However, we lack robust and efficient ways to monitor the temporal dynamics of leaf traits. Here we assessed the potential of leaf spectroscopy to predict and monitor leaf traits across their entire life cycle at different forest sites and light environments (sunlit vs. shaded) using a weekly sampled dataset across the entire growing season at two temperate deciduous forests. The dataset includes field measured leaf-level directional-hemispherical reflectance/transmittance together with seven important leaf traits [total chlorophyll (chlorophyll a and b), carotenoids, mass-based nitrogen concentration (N-mass), mass-based carbon mass, concentration (C-mass), and leaf mass per area (LMA)]. All leaf traits varied significantly throughout the growing season, and displayed trait-specific temporal patterns. We used a Partial Least Square Regression (PLSR) modeling approach to estimate leaf traits from spectra, and found that PLSR was able to capture the variability across time, sites, and light environments of all leaf traits investigated (R-2 = 0.6-0.8 for temporal variability; R-2 = 0.3-0.7 for cross-site variability; R-2 = 0.4-0.8 for variability from light environments). We also tested alternative field sampling designs and found that for most leaf traits, biweekly leaf sampling throughout the growing season enabled accurate characterization of the seasonal patterns. Compared with the estimation of foliar pigments, the performance of N-mass, C-mass and LMA PLSR models improved more significantly with sampling frequency. Our results demonstrate that leaf spectra-trait relationships vary with time, and thus tracking the seasonality of leaf traits requires statistical models calibrated with data sampled throughout the growing season. Our results have broad implications for future research that use vegetation spectra to infer leaf traits at different growing stages. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Climate change is one of the greatest threats to the persistence of coral reefs. Sustained and ongoing increases in ocean temperatures and acidification are altering the structure and function of reefs globally. Here, we summarise recent advances in our understanding of the effects of climate change on scleractinian corals and reef fish. Although there is considerable among-species variability in responses to increasing temperature and seawater chemistry, changing temperature regimes are likely to have the greatest influence on the structure of coral and fish assemblages, at least over short-medium timeframes. Recent evidence of increases in coral bleaching thresholds, local genetic adaptation and inheritance of heat tolerance suggest that coral populations may have some capacity to respond to warming, although the extent to which these changes can keep pace with changing environmental conditions is unknown. For coral reef fishes, current evidence indicates increasing seawater temperature will be a major determinant of future assemblages, through both habitat degradation and direct effects on physiology and behaviour. The effects of climate change are, however, being compounded by a range of anthropogenic disturbances, which may undermine the capacity of coral reef organisms to acclimate and/or adapt to specific changes in environmental conditions.

AB |Root trait variation and plasticity could be key factors differentiating plant performance under drought. However, water manipulation and root measurements are rarely coupled empirically across growth forms to identify whether belowground strategies are generalizable across species. We measured seedling root traits across three moisture levels in 18 Mediterranean forbs, grasses, and woody species. Drought increased the root mass fraction (RMF) and decreased the relative proportion of thin roots (indicated by increased root diameters and decreased specific root length (SRL)), rates of root elongation and growth, plant nitrogen uptake, and plant growth. Although responses varied across species, plasticity was not associated with growth form. Woody species differed from forbs and grasses in many traits, but herbaceous groups were similar. Across water treatments, trait correlations suggested a single spectrum of belowground trade-offs related to resource acquisition and plant growth. While effects of SRL and RMF on plant growth shifted with drought, root elongation rate consistently represented this spectrum. We demonstrate that general patterns of root morphology and plasticity are identifiable across diverse species. Root trait measurements should enhance our understanding of belowground strategy and performance across growth forms, but it will be critical to incorporate plasticity and additional aspects of root function into these efforts.

AB The recent rise in agricultural commodity prices and the expectation that high price will persist have triggered a wave of farmland expansion in regions where land resources are still available. One such region is the former Soviet Union, where the collapse of socialism caused massive agricultural abandonment and where some of these lands are now being brought back into production. Yet, the extent and spatial patterns of recultivation, and what determines these patterns, remains unclear. We examined the extent of recultivation of abandoned agricultural land in Ukraine since 2007 using a new, satellite-based recultivation map and assessed the effect of biophysical and socioeconomic determinants on recultivation patterns using boosted regression trees. We found key predictors of recultivation to be related to the suitability of land for agriculture (i.e., soil quality, temperature). Accessibility to major cities was also important, with most recultivation happening closer to settlements, but this influence varied across Ukraine. Variables related to agricultural management (fertilizer input, mechanization) and demography were negligible in explaining recultivation in our analyses. These factors suggest that recultivation patterns were primarily driven by factors related to land productivity, with recultivation focusing on the most promising areas. Given the remaining large amount of unused agricultural land in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, and considering that much abandonment occurred in areas only marginally suited to agriculture, our findings provide important insights into where recultivation can be expected to happen and thus for assessing the potential socioeconomic and environmental impacts of recultivation.

AB The Amazon River Basin contains the world's highest fish species diversity, with a hydrologic cycle that creates a patchy distribution of floodplain lakes at low water and affords dispersal and colonization opportunities through reconnected lakes, rivers, and flooded forests during high water. This connectivity is increasingly threatened by dam construction and droughts caused by climate change. Although the metapopulation framework has not been widely applied to freshwater ecosystems, it should represent a fruitful approach to conservation of important fish stocks and species diversity in Amazonian floodplains. Our examination of the evidence for metapopulation structure reveals that: (1) Although many economically important migratory species are not currently metapopulations (either demographically or genetically), connectivity is crucial to their life histories and anthropogenic stresses may induce metapopulation structure in these species; (2) Some large migratory pimelodid catfish with homing behavior to natal headwater streams appear to be the most spatially expansive metapopulations in existence among freshwater fish; (3) Non-migratory species are less well studied, but some (perhaps many) such species already exist as metapopulations and are vulnerable to disruptions in patterns of connectivity. Connectivity plays a crucial role in each of these cases, so the most promising conservation strategies involve: (1) reduction in dam building; (2) establishment of large enough protected areas to incorporate high 13 diversity and maintain patterns of connectivity during anomalous low water events; (3) implementation of governmentally facilitated community-based fishing agreements to curb overexploitation and monitor sustainable population levels and connectivity in protected areas.

AB Although ecosystem services have been intensively examined in certain domains (e.g., forests and wetlands), little research has assessed ecosystem services for the most dominant landscape type in urban ecosystems-namely, residential yards. In this paper, we report findings of a cross-site survey of homeowners in six U.S. cities to 1) examine how residents subjectively value various ecosystem services, 2) explore distinctive dimensions of those values, and 3) test the urban homogenization hypothesis. This hypothesis posits that urbanization leads to similarities in the social-ecological dynamics across cities in diverse biomes. By extension, the thesis suggests that residents' ecosystem service priorities for residential landscapes will be similar regardless of whether residents live in the humid East or the arid West, or the warm South or the cold North. Results underscored that cultural services were of utmost importance, particularly anthropocentric values including aesthetics, low-maintenance, and personal enjoyment. Using factor analyses, distinctive dimensions of residents' values were found to partially align with the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment's categories (provisioning, regulating, supporting, and cultural). Finally, residents' ecosystem service priorities exhibited significant homogenization across regions. In particular, the traditional lawn aesthetic (neat, green, weed-free yards) was similarly important across residents of diverse U.S. cities. Only a few exceptions were found across different environmental and social contexts; for example, cooling effects were more important in the warm South, where residents also valued aesthetics more than those in the North, where low-maintenance yards were a greater priority.

   Context A decade after the first forest tree genome sequence was released into the public domain, the rapidly evolving genomics and bioinformatics toolbox has advanced our understanding of the structure, functioning, and evolution of forest tree genomes.
   Aims and methods This review highlights some of the discoveries and applications that "omics" technologies have made possible for forest trees over the past 10 years.
   Results In this review, we start by our current understanding of genome evolution and intricacies of gene regulation for reproduction, development, and responses to biotic and abiotic stresses. We then skim over advances in interactome analysis and epigenomics, the knowledge of the extent of genetic variation within and between species, revealing micro- and macro-evolutionary processes and species history, together with the complex architecture of quantitative traits. We finally end with applications in genetic resource conservation and breeding.
   Conclusion The knowledge gained through the use of these technologies has a huge potential impact for adapting forests to the main challenges they will have to face: changing demand from ecosystem services with potentially conflicting strategies in terms of conservation and use, as well as climate changes and associated threats. Genomics will undoubtedly play a major role over the next decade and beyond, not only to further understand the mechanisms underlying adaptation and evolution but also to develop and implement innovative management and policy actions to preserve the adaptability of natural forests and intensively managed plantations.

AB Introducing a carbon-concentrating mechanism and a faster Rubisco enzyme from cyanobacteria into higher plant chloroplasts may improve photosynthetic performance by increasing the rate of CO2 fixation while decreasing losses caused by photorespiration. We previously demonstrated that tobacco plants grow photoautotrophically using Rubisco from Synechococcus elongatus, although the plants exhibited considerably slower growth than wild-type and required supplementary CO2. Because of concerns that vascular plant assembly factors may not be adequate for assembly of a cyanobacterial Rubisco, prior transgenic plants included the cyanobacterial chaperone RbcX or the carboxysomal protein CcmM35. Here we show that neither RbcX nor CcmM35 is needed for assembly of active cyanobacterial Rubisco. Furthermore, by altering the gene regulatory sequences on the Rubisco transgenes, cyanobacterial Rubisco expression was enhanced and the transgenic plants grew at near wild-type growth rates, although still requiring elevated CO2. We performed detailed kinetic characterization of the enzymes produced with and without the RbcX and CcmM35 cyanobacterial proteins. These transgenic plants exhibit photosynthetic characteristics that confirm the predicted benefits of introduction of non-native forms of Rubisco with higher carboxylation rate constants in vascular plants and the potential nitrogen-use efficiency that may be achieved provided that adequate CO2 is available near the enzyme.

AB Tomorrow's forests face extreme pressures from contemporary climate change, invasive pests, and anthropogenic demands for other land uses. These pressures, collectively, demand land managers to reassess current and potential forest management practices. We discuss three considerations, functional restoration, assisted migration, and bioengineering, which are currently being debated in the literature and have the potential to be applied independently or concurrently across a variety of scales. The emphasis of functional restoration is to reestablish or maintain functions provided by the forest ecosystem, such as water quality, wildlife habitat, or carbon sequestration. Maintaining function may call upon actions such as assisted migration-moving tree populations within a species current range to aid adaptation to climate change or moving a species far outside its current range to avoid extinction-and we attempt to synthesize an array of assisted migration terminology. In addition, maintenance of species and the functions they provide may also require new technologies, such as genetic engineering, which, compared with traditional approaches to breeding for pest resistance, may be accomplished more rapidly to meet and overcome the challenges of invasive insect and disease pests. As managers develop holistic adaptive strategies to current and future anthropogenic stresses, functional restoration, assisted migration, and bioengineering, either separately or in combinations, deserve consideration, but must be addressed within the context of the restoration goal.

AB Ocean and coastal ecosystems provide critical fisheries, coastal protection, and cultural benefits to communities worldwide, but these services are diminishing due to local and global threats. In response, place-based strategies involve communities and resource users in management have proliferated. Here, we present a transferable community-based approach to assess the social and ecological factors affecting resource sustainability and food security in a small-scale, coral reef fishery. Our results show that this small-scale fishery provides large-scale benefits to communities, including 7,353 +/- 1547 kg yr(-1) (mean +/- SE) of seafood per year, equating to >30,000 meals with an economic value of $78,432. The vast majority of the catch is used for subsistence, contributing to community food security: 58% is kept, 33.5% is given away, and 8.5% is sold. Our spatial analysis assesses the geographic distribution of community beneficiaries from the fishery (the "food shed" for the fishery), and we document that 20% of seafood procured from the fishery is used for sociocultural events that are important for social cohesion. This approach provides a method for assessing social, economic, and cultural values provided by small-scale food systems, as well as important contributions to food security, with significant implications for conservation and management. This interdisciplinary effort aims to demonstrate a transferable participatory research approach useful for resource-dependent communities as they cope with socioeconomic, cultural, and environmental change.

AB Environmental variation often induces shifts in functional traits, yet we know little about whether plasticity will reduce extinction risks under climate change. As climate change proceeds, phenotypic plasticity could enable species with limited dispersal capacity to persist in situ, and migrating populations of other species to establish in new sites at higher elevations or latitudes. Alternatively, climate change could induce maladaptive plasticity, reducing fitness, and potentially stalling adaptation and migration. Here, we quantified plasticity in life history, foliar morphology, and ecophysiology in Boechera stricta (Brassicaceae), a perennial forb native to the Rocky Mountains. In this region, warming winters are reducing snowpack and warming springs are advancing the timing of snow melt. We hypothesized that traits that were historically advantageous in hot and dry, low-elevation locations will be favored at higher elevation sites due to climate change. To test this hypothesis, we quantified trait variation in natural populations across an elevational gradient. We then estimated plasticity and genetic variation in common gardens at two elevations. Finally, we tested whether climatic manipulations induce plasticity, with the prediction that plants exposed to early snow removal would resemble individuals from lower elevation populations. In natural populations, foliar morphology and ecophysiology varied with elevation in the predicted directions. In the common gardens, trait plasticity was generally concordant with phenotypic clines from the natural populations. Experimental snow removal advanced flowering phenology by 7days, which is similar in magnitude to flowering time shifts over 2-3 decades of climate change. Therefore, snow manipulations in this system can be used to predict eco-evolutionary responses to global change. Snow removal also altered foliar morphology, but in unexpected ways. Extensive plasticity could buffer against immediate fitness declines due to changing climates.

AB Conservation planning is crucial for megadiverse countries where biodiversity is coupled with incomplete reserve systems and limited resources to invest in conservation. Using Peru as an example of a megadiverse country, we asked whether the national system of protected areas satisfies biodiversity conservation needs. Further, to complement the existing reserve system, we identified and prioritized potential conservation areas using a combination of species distribution modeling, conservation planning and connectivity analysis. Based on a set of 2,869 species, including mammals, birds, amphibians, reptiles, butterflies, and plants, we used species distribution models to represent species' geographic ranges to reduce the effect of biased sampling and partial knowledge about species' distributions. A site-selection algorithm then searched for efficient and complementary proposals, based on the above distributions, for a more representative system of protection. Finally, we incorporated connectivity among areas in an innovative post-hoc analysis to prioritize those areas maximizing connectivity within the system. Our results highlight severe conservation gaps in the Coastal and Andean regions, and we propose several areas, which are not currently covered by the existing network of protected areas. Our approach helps to find areas that contribute to creating a more representative, connected and efficient network.

AB The assessment of the ecological status of water bodies, as requires by the European Water Framework Directive, can raise a number of problems when applied to temporary streams. These problems are because of the particular physical, chemical and biological conditions resulting from the recurrent cessation of flow or even the complete drying of the stream beds. In such non-permanent water bodies, the reference quality standards developed for permanent streams may only be applicable under certain circumstances or may not be applicable at all. Work conducted within the collaborative EU-funded project Mediterranean Intermittent River ManAGEment (MIRAGE) has addressed most of these difficulties and has used diverse approaches to solve them. These approaches have been brought together in the so-called MIRAGE Toolbox. This toolbox consists of a series of methodologies that are designed to be used in a sequential manner to allow the establishment of the ecological and chemical status of temporary streams and to relate these findings to the hydrological status of the streams. The toolbox is intended to serve the following purposes: (i) the determination of the hydrological regime of the stream; (ii) the design of adequate schedules for biological and chemical sampling according to the aquatic state of the stream; (iii) the fulfillment of criteria for designing reference condition stations; (iv) the analysis of hydrological modifications of the stream regime (with the definition of the hydrological status); and (v) the development of new methods to measure the ecological status (including structural and functional methods) and chemical status when the stream's hydrological conditions are far from those in permanent streams.

AB Plant defence theories have recently evolved in such a way that not only the quantity but also the quality of mineral nutrients is expected to influence plant constitutive defence. Recently, an extended prediction derived from the protein competition model (PCM) suggested that nitrogen (N) limitation is more important for the production of phenolic compounds than phosphorus (P). We aimed at studying sexual differences in the patterns of carbon allocation to growth and constitutive defence in relation to N and P availability in Populus tremula L. seedlings. We compared the gender responses in photosynthesis, growth and whole-plant allocation to phenolic compounds at different combination levels of N and P, and studied how they are explained by the main plant defence theories. We found no sexual differences in phenolic concentrations, but interestingly, slow-growing females had higher leaf N concentration than did males, and genders differed in their allocation priority. There was a trade-off between growth and the production of flavonoid-derived phenylpropanoids on one hand, and between the production of salicylates and flavonoid-derived phenylpropanoids on the other. Under limited nutrient conditions, females prioritized mineral nutrient acquisition, flavonoid and condensed tannin (CT) production, while males invested more in above-ground biomass. Salicylate accumulation followed the growth differentiation balance hypothesis as low NaEuro...mainly decreased the production of leaf and stem salicylate content while the combination of both low N and low P increased the amount of flavonoids and CTs allocated to leaves and to a lesser extent stems, which agrees with the PCM. We suggest that such a discrepancy in the responses of salicylates and flavonoid-derived CTs is linked to their clearly distinct biosynthetic origins and/or their metabolic costs.

AB Thermal acclimation of soil organic matter (SOM) decomposition is frequently observed and has often been attributed to substrate depletion under warming, but other mechanisms, such as changes in microbial community structure and functioning, have received less attention. In order to determine whether shifts in microbial community structure and functioning are involved in thermal acclimation of SOM decomposition, a laboratory incubation experiment was conducted using an artificial forest soil. Samples were first subjected to different temperatures of 5, 15, and 25 degrees C during a 72-day pre-incubation period and then half of the microcosms from each pre-incubation temperature were incubated at 5 or 25 degrees C for a period of 11 days. Substantial thermal acclimation of SOM decomposition was observed, with the SOM decomposition in soils pre-incubated at higher temperatures being less sensitive to temperature. Along with the reduced temperature sensitivity in response to warming, significant changes in microbial community PLFAs, microbial biomass carbon (MBC), and the potential activities of 11 enzymes were also observed. Nevertheless, shifts in microbial community PLFAs and particular enzyme activities provided the most explanatory power for the decreased temperature sensitivity with warming, as revealed by a multivariate regression analysis. The microbial community structure shifts were mainly manifested as an increase in the relative abundance of Gram-positive bacteria and decreases in the relative abundances of Gram-negative bacteria and fungi. Microbial communities pre-incubated under lower temperatures experienced greater shifts in their structure. Substrate depletion did not occur in this short-term incubation experiment, since neither total organic carbon (TOC) nor dissolved organic carbon (DOC) decreased with increasing temperature. Our results suggest that shifts in microbial community structure and functioning may underlie the thermal acclimation of SOM decomposition and should be taken into account when predicting the response of soil CO2 efflux to global warming.

AB Targeted conservation and management programs are crucial for mitigating anthropogenic threats to declining biodiversity. Although evolutionary processes underpin extant patterns of biodiversity, it is uncommon for resource managers to explicitly consider genetic data in conservation prioritization. Genetic information is inherently relevant to management because it describes genetic diversity, population connectedness, and evolutionary history; thereby typifying their behavioral traits, physiological climate tolerance, evolutionary potential, and dispersal ability. Incorporating genetic information into spatial conservation prioritization starts with reconciling the terminology and techniques used in genetics and conservation science. Genetic data vary widely in analyses and their interpretations can be challenging even for experienced geneticists. Therefore, identifying objectives, decision rules, and implementations in decision support tools specifically for management using genetic data is challenging. Here, we outline a framework for eight genetic system characteristics, their measurement, and how they could be incorporated in spatial conservation prioritization for two contrasting objectives: biodiversity preservation vs maintaining ecological function and sustainable use. We illustrate this framework with an example using data from Tridacna crocea (Lamarck, 1819) (boring giant clam) in the Coral Triangle. We find that many reefs highlighted as conservation priorities with genetic data based on genetic subregions, genetic diversity, genetic distinctness, and connectivity are not prioritized using standard practices. Moreover, different characteristics calculated from the same samples resulted in different spatial conservation priorities. Our results highlight that omitting genetic information from conservation decisions may fail to adequately represent processes regulating biodiversity, but that conservation objectives related to the choice of genetic system characteristics require careful consideration.

AB Question Does the abundance of keystone forest floor species change in response to changes in the forest structure? Location Sweden Methods We used data from the Swedish National Forest Inventory to investigate changes in the abundance of three common species, as well as the total abundance of all understorey vascular plants (the field layer) in forests in the boreal and temperate parts of Sweden. GLMs and GAMs were used to relate species abundance and temporal changes in abundances to forest structure and forest structural change. Results Productivity, measured as the site index, was the most important determinant of individual species' abundance. The volume of Picea abies, the density of tree stems and forest age were among the most important forest structural variables. We found that the dwarf shrub Vaccinium myrtillus, the narrow-leaved grasses (mainly Avenella flexuosa) and the total field layer cover decreased in boreal Sweden from 1994 through 2010 and that these changes coincided with an increase in forest density and with a reduction in forest age. Conclusions Changes in Swedish forests to higher tree layer density and younger age appear to contribute significantly to current changes in forest floor vegetation. The use of more intensive thinning practices to reduce the total density of the forest and to increase the proportion of broad-leaved tree species and Pinus sylvestris would favour the forest floor species in this study. Moreover, increasing forest age (i.e. the length of rotation periods) might favour V. myrtillus in particular, for which the time since disturbance is important for the recovery of pre-disturbance abundance. However, increased thinning intensity and forest age will reduce the potential for wood production, implying a trade-off between production of wood and maintenance of well-developed forest floor vegetation.

AB The condition of many wetlands across Australia has deteriorated due to increased water regulation and the expansion and intensification of agriculture and increased urban and industrial expansion. Despite this situation, a comprehensive overview of the distribution and condition of wetlands across Australia is not available. Regional analyses exist and several exemplary mapping and monitoring exercises have been maintained to complement the more general information sets. It is expected that global climate change will exacerbate the pressures on inland wetlands, while sea level rises will adversely affect coastal wetlands. It is also expected that the exacerbation of these pressures will increase the potential for near-irreversible changes in the ecological state of some wetlands. Concerted institutional responses to such pressures have in the past proven difficult to sustain, although there is some evidence that a more balanced approach to water use and agriculture is being developed with the provision of increasing funds to purchase water for environmental flows being one example. We identify examples from around Australia that illustrate the impacts on wetlands of long-term climate change from palaeoecological records (south-eastern Australia); water allocation (Murray-Darling Basin); dryland salinisation (south-western Australia); and coastal salinisation (northern Australia). These are provided to illustrate both the extent of change in wetlands and the complexity of differentiating the specific effects of climate change. An appraisal of the main policy responses by government to climate change is provided as a basis for further considering the opportunities for mitigation and adaptation to climate change.

AB Anticipating species movement under climate change is a major focus in conservation. Bioclimate models are one of the few predictive tools for adaptation planning, but are limited in accounting for (i) climatic tolerances in preadult life stages that are potentially more vulnerable to warming; and (ii) local-scale movement and use of climatic refugia as an alternative or complement to large-scale changes in distribution. To assess whether these shortfalls can be addressed with field demographic data, we used California valley oak (Quercus lobata Nee), a long-lived species with juvenile life stages known to be sensitive to climate. We hypothesized that the valley oak bioclimate model, based on adults, would overpredict the species' ability to remain in the projected persisting area, due to higher climate vulnerability of young life stages; and underpredict the potential for the species to remain in the projected contracting area in local-scale refugia. We assessed the bioclimate model projections against actual demographic patterns in natural populations. We found that saplings were more constricted around surface water than adults in the projected contracting area. We also found that the climate envelope for saplings is narrower than that for adults. Saplings disappeared at a summer maximum temperature 3 similar to degrees C below that associated with adults. Our findings indicate that rather than a complete shift northward and upward, as predicted by the species bioclimate model, valley oaks are more likely to experience constriction around water bodies, and eventual disappearance from areas exceeding a threshold of maximum temperature. Ours is the first study we know of to examine the importance of discrete life stage climate sensitivities in determining bioclimate modeling inputs, and to identify current climate change-related constriction of a species around microrefugia. Our findings illustrate that targeted biological fieldwork can be central to understanding climate change-related movement for long-lived, sessile species.

AB Acclimation of foliage photosynthetic properties occurs with varying time kinetics, but structural, chemical and physiological factors controlling the kinetics of acclimation are poorly understood, especially in field environments. We measured chlorophyll fluorescence characteristics, leaf total carotenoid (Car), chlorophyll (Chl) and nitrogen (N) content and leaf dry mass per area (LMA) along vertical light gradients in natural canopies of the herb species, Inula salicina and Centaurea jacea, and tree species, Populus tremula and Tilia cordata, in the middle of the growing season. Presence of stress was assessed on the basis of night measurements of chlorophyll fluorescence. Our aim was to compare the light acclimation of leaf traits, which respond to light availability at long (LMA and N), medium (Chl a/b ratio, Car/Chl ratio) and short time scales (fluorescence characteristics). We found that light acclimation of nitrogen content per unit leaf area (Narea), chlorophyll content per unit dry mass (Chlmass) and Chl/N ratio were related to modifications in LMA. The maximum PSII quantum yield (Fv/Fm) increased with increasing growth irradiance in I. salicina and P. tremula but decreased in T. cordata. Leaf growth irradiance, N content and plant species explained the majority of variability in chlorophyll fluorescence characteristics, up to 90% for steady-state fluorescence yield, while the contribution of leaf total carotenoid content was generally not significant. Chlorophyll fluorescence characteristics did not differ strongly between growth forms, but differed among species within a given growth form. These data highlight that foliage acclimation to light is driven by interactions between traits with varying time kinetics.

AB The anisotropic structure of climatic space may cause significant (and to a large extent unappreciated) non-evolutionary niche shifts. This can be seen mostly in the context of spatial transferability of ecological niche models. We explore this effect using a virtual species in the United States. We created a simple virtual species by postulating its fundamental niche as an ellipse in a two-dimensional realistic climatic space. The climatic combinations defined by the ellipse were projected in the geography of the United States and 2 regions of equal area were selected. The structure of niche in the 2 areas is compared. It is shown that the 2 regions have differently positioned subsets of the environmental space, which creates "shifts" in the realized niches despite the fact that no evolution and no biotic interactions are present. The most parsimonious hypothesis when ecological niche modeling reveals shifts in the realized niche is that environmental space is heterogeneous. Without considering differences in the structure of environmental space no speculation about niche evolution or the role of competitors should be attempted.

AB Southwestern Australia has been recognized as a biodiversity hot spot of global significance, and it is particularly well known for its considerable diversity of flowering plant species. Questions of interest are how this region became so diverse and whether its fauna show similar diverse patterns of speciation. Here, we carried out a phylogeographic study of trapdoor spiders (Migidae: Moggridgea), a presumed Gondwanan lineage found in wet forest localities across southwestern Australia. Phylogenetic, molecular clock and population genetic analyses of mitochondrial (mtDNA) COI gene and ITS rRNA (internal transcribed spacer) data revealed considerable phylogeographic structuring of Moggridgea populations, with evidence for long-term (>3 million years) isolation of at least nine populations in different geographic locations, including upland regions of the Stirling and Porongurup Ranges. High levels of mtDNA divergence and no evidence of recent mitochondrial gene flow among valley populations of the Stirling Range suggest that individual valleys have acted as refugia for the spiders throughout the Pleistocene. Our findings support the hypothesis that climate change, particularly the aridification of Australia after the late Miocene, and the topography of the landscape, which allowed persistence of moist habitats, have been major drivers of speciation in southwestern Australia.

AB Ecosystem carbon exchange is poorly understood in low-productivity, semiarid habitats. Here we studied the controls of soil temperature and moisture on soil respiration in climate change field experiment in a sandy forest-steppe. Soil CO2 efflux was measured monthly from April to November in 2003-2008 on plots receiving either rain exclusion or nocturnal warming, or serving as ambient control. Based on this dataset, we developed and compared empirical models of temperature and moisture effects on soil respiration. Results suggest that in this semiarid ecosystem the main controlling factor for soil CO2 efflux is soil temperature, while soil moisture has less, although significant effect on soil respiration. Clear thresholds for moisture effects on temperature sensitivity were identified at 0.6, 4.0 and 7.0 vol% by almost each model, which relate well to other known limits for biological activity in this sandy soil. The relationship between soil respiration and temperature was better described by the Lloyd-Taylor or the Gaussian functions compared to exponential function. Involving additive and interactive soil moisture effects further improved model fitting. Similarly to other low productivity semiarid ecosystems, annual soil carbon efflux values estimated by the different models were rather low (between 123.1 and 139.8 g C m(-2) yr(-1) as multi-year averages).

AB Hopper (Plant Soil 322:49-86, 2009) introduced landscape age, climate buffering, and soil nutrient status as descriptors for a continuum between old, climatically buffered landscapes characterised by low soil fertility (OCBIL) and young, often disturbed landscapes characterised by fertile soils (YODFEL). Hopper (Plant Soil 322:49-86, 2009) provided an important framework for biodiversity and conservation. We argue that Hopper's (Plant Soil 322:49-86, 2009) conceptual framework includes five areas worthy of further consideration. These include: (1) The appropriateness of the original three dimensions; (2) The need for deeper consideration of rejuvenation and disturbance within OCBILs. (3) Broadening the globally relevant range of environments. (4) Operationalising the definitions or dimensions. (5) Revisiting the scale and compatibility of the predictions. Here, we address the first four of these areas and offer an alternative conceptual framework based on the idea of Old Stable Landscapes (OSLs). We redefine Hopper's climate buffering as a dimension of climate stability, identify soil-impoverishment as a function of landscape age, and recognise fire regime predictability as a large-scale, long-term evolutionarily important dimension. In so doing, we construct a globally-relevant, qualitative template to enable the testing of evolutionary-ecological hypotheses concerning biodiversity (e.g. species diversity, diversity gradients, endemism, speciation and extinction rates, cladogenesis, persistence of old lineages, refugial phenomena). Our template is characterised by having operationally defined dimensions, which can be used to design surveys and experiments to address the issues of biodiversity conservation, recovery, and restoration under variations in landscape age, climatic stability and fire regime.

AB The ongoing and future effects of global climate change on natural and human-managed ecosystems have led to a renewed interest in the concept of ecological thresholds or tipping points. While generalizations such as pole-ward range shifts serve as a useful heuristic framework to understand the overall ecological impacts of climate change, sophisticated approaches to management require spatially and temporally explicit predictions that move beyond these oversimplified models. Most approaches to studying ecological thresholds in marine ecosystems tend to focus on populations, or on non-linearities in physical drivers. Here we argue that many of the observed thresholds observed at community and ecosystem levels can potentially be explained as the product of non-linearities that occur at three scales: (a) the mechanisms by which individual organisms interact with their ambient habitat, (b) the non-linear relationship between organismal physiological performance and variables such as body temperature and (c) the indirect effects of physiological stress on species interactions such as competition and predation. We explore examples at each of these scales in detail and explain why a failure to consider these non-linearities - many of which can be counterintuitive - can lead to Type II errors (a failure to predict significant ecological responses to climate change). Specifically, we examine why ecological thresholds can occur well before concomitant thresholds in physical drivers are observed, i.e. how even small linear changes in the physical environment can lead to ecological tipping points. We advocate for an integrated framework that combines biophysical, ecological and physiological methods to generate hypotheses that can be tested using experimental manipulation as well as hindcasting and nowcasting of observed change, on a spatially and temporally explicit basis.

AB In the Southern and Southeastern Brazilian highlands, a clade of seven species of Petunia that are endemic to the region (P. altiplana, P. bonjardinensis, P. guarapuavensis, P. mantiqueirensis, P. reitzii, P. saxicola and P. scheideana) exists in association with grassland formations. These formations are isolated in high-altitude regions, being surrounded by forested areas, and experienced contraction-expansion cycles associated with the glacial cycles of the Pleistocene. To understand the evolutionary history of this group, the divergence of which is probably linked to these past shifts in habitat, we analysed the sequences of the plastidial intergenic spacers trnH-psbA and trnS-trnG from populations throughout the known distributions of all seven species. The common ancestor of this highland clade started to differentiate similar to 0.9 million years (Myr) ago, which corresponds to a high diversification rate of 2.06 species per Myr in the intervening period. The high level of haplotype sharing among several species in the clade and the absence of reciprocal monophyly suggest the persistence of ancestral polymorphisms during speciation events and/or past hybridization, because no hybrid was found. Four of the five species displayed very low genetic diversity and possessed either one or two haplotypes, which is consistent with long-term isolation in restricted areas. The three more diverse species displayed significant population structure, and P. altiplana showed a clear signs of population growth during the last glacial period. These results suggest that diversification occurred as a result of expansion of the ancestral species of the clade during glacial periods followed by fragmentation and isolation during retraction in interglacial periods.

AB Following glacial recession in southeast Alaska, waterfalls created by isostatic rebound have isolated numerous replicate populations of coastal cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii clarkii) in short coastal streams. These replicate isolated populations offer an unusual opportunity to examine factors associated with the maintenance of genetic diversity. We used eight microsatellites to examine genetic variation within and differentiation among 12 population pairs sampled from above and below these natural migration barriers. Geological evidence indicated that the above-barrier populations have been isolated for 8,000-12,500 years. Genetic differentiation among below-barrier populations (F-ST = 0.10, 95% C. I. 0.08-0.12) was similar to a previous study of more southern populations of this species. Above-barrier populations were highly differentiated from adjacent below-barrier populations (mean pairwise F-ST = 0.28; SD 0.18) and multiple lines of evidence were consistent with asymmetric downstream gene flow that varied among streams. Each above-barrier population had reduced within-population genetic variation when compared to the adjacent below-barrier population. Within-population genetic diversity was significantly correlated with the amount of available habitat in above-barrier sites. Increased genetic differentiation of above-barrier populations with lower genetic diversity suggests that genetic drift has been the primary cause of genetic divergence. Long-term estimates of N-e based on loss of heterozygosity over the time since isolation were large (3,170; range 1,077-7,606) and established an upper limit for N-e if drift were the only evolutionary process responsible for loss of genetic diversity. However, it is likely that a combination of mutation, selection, and gene flow have also contributed to the genetic diversity of above-barrier populations. Contemporary above-barrier N-e estimates were much smaller than long-term N-e estimates, not correlated with within-population genetic diversity, and not consistent with the amount of genetic variation retained, given the approximate 10,000-year period of isolation. The populations isolated by waterfalls in this study that occur in larger stream networks have retained substantial genetic variation, which suggests that the amount of habitat in headwater streams is an important consideration for maintaining the evolutionary potential of isolated populations.

AB A revision of the Early-Middle Miocene anguine, Pseudopus laurillardi (Lartet, 1851), is presented based on a detailed anatomical analysis of one newly discovered articulated specimen and numerous disarticulated cranial and postcranial elements from several localities in Germany, as well as on the restudy of the original skeletal material of Lartet. The articulated specimen represents the first record of an articulated anguine from the Neogene. We demonstrate that the contemporaneous anguine Propseudopus fraasii (= Pseudopus fraasi, Pseudopus moguntinus or Ophisaurus moguntinus) from Germany and elsewhere in Europe represents a junior synonym of P. laurillardi. Three species of Pseudopus can by discriminated in the Cenozoic of Eurasia: P. laurillardi (Early-Middle Miocene of Europe), P. pannonicus (Late Miocene-Middle Pleistocene of central and eastern Europe) and P. apodus (Late Pleistocene-Recent, from Eastern Europe to central Asia). Eleven morphological characters of the skull have been identified that distinguish Pseudopus laurillardi from P. pannonicus and P. apodus. Four of these characters regard the frontal and parietal bones, whereas all other characters regard the dentary and dentition. The genus Pseudopus represents the largest and most robust taxon in the subfamily Anguinae and first occurs in central Europe at the beginning of MN 4 (similar to 18.5 Ma). In contrast to the extant species, P. apodus, the fossils P. laurillardi and P. pannonicus had a greater ecological plasticity and lived in various types of environments. The fossil remains of these taxa are most frequently found in localities characterized by sub-humid to humid climate, which may indicate that their preferential habitats include forested environments.

AB Diseases often display complex and distinct associations with their environment due to differences in etiology, modes of transmission between hosts, and the shifting balance between pathogen virulence and host resistance. Statistical modeling has been underutilized in coral disease research to explore the spatial patterns that result from this triad of interactions. We tested the hypotheses that: 1) coral diseases show distinct associations with multiple environmental factors, 2) incorporating interactions (synergistic collinearities) among environmental variables is important when predicting coral disease spatial patterns, and 3) modeling overall coral disease prevalence (the prevalence of multiple diseases as a single proportion value) will increase predictive error relative to modeling the same diseases independently. Four coral diseases: Porites growth anomalies (PorGA), Porites tissue loss (PorTL), Porites trematodiasis (PorTrem), and Montipora white syndrome (MWS), and their interactions with 17 predictor variables were modeled using boosted regression trees (BRT) within a reef system in Hawaii. Each disease showed distinct associations with the predictors. Environmental predictors showing the strongest overall associations with the coral diseases were both biotic and abiotic. PorGA was optimally predicted by a negative association with turbidity, PorTL and MWS by declines in butterflyfish and juvenile parrotfish abundance respectively, and PorTrem by a modal relationship with Porites host cover. Incorporating interactions among predictor variables contributed to the predictive power of our models, particularly for PorTrem. Combining diseases (using overall disease prevalence as the model response), led to an average six-fold increase in cross-validation predictive deviance over modeling the diseases individually. We therefore recommend coral diseases to be modeled separately, unless known to have etiologies that respond in a similar manner to particular environmental conditions. Predictive statistical modeling can help to increase our understanding of coral disease ecology worldwide.

AB Marine capture fisheries are an important source of protein globally, with coastal and oceanic fish providing a rich source of essential fatty acids, vitamins, and minerals. Fisheries also support economies and important social structures in many nations, particularly developing nations (Allison et al., 2009). Marine fisheries are under increasing threat from climate change, with climate change now identified as the latest threat to the world's fast declining fish stocks (UNEP, 2008; Cochrane et al., 2009). Marine fisheries will be exposed to increasing sea surface temperatures, ocean acidification, sea level rise, increasing storm intensity and altered ocean circulation, and rainfall patterns that will affect target species through a range of direct and indirect mechanisms. The sensitivity of fish stocks to these changes will determine the range of potential impacts to life cycles, species distributions, community structure, productivity, connectivity, organism performance, recruitment dynamics, prevalence of invasive species, and access to marine resources by fishers. Many fisheries are already experiencing changes in target species diversity and abundance, species distribution, and habitat area, as well as loss of fishing effort due to intensifying storms (Johnson and Marshall, 2007; Hobday et al., 2008; UNEP, 2008). Using a vulnerability assessment framework, we examine the level of vulnerability of marine fisheries to climate change and the factors that will temper vulnerability, such as adaptive capacity. Assessing fisheries vulnerability to climate change is essential to prioritize systems in greatest need of intervention, understand the drivers of vulnerability to identify future research directions, and more importantly, to review current fisheries management with the view to develop management responses that will be effective in securing the future sustainability of marine fisheries.

AB This article considers a measure of variable importance frequently used in variable-selection methods based on decision trees and tree-based ensemble models. These models include CART, random forests, and gradient boosting machine. The measure of variable importance is defined as the total heterogeneity reduction produced by a given covariate on the response variable when the sample space is recursively partitioned. Despite its popularity, some authors have shown that this measure is biased to the extent that, under certain conditions, there may be dangerous effects on variable selection. Here we present a simple and effective method for bias correction, focusing on the easily generalizable case of the Gini index as a measure of heterogeneity.

AB Previous studies have attempted to assess the reproductive benefits of polyandry in mammals but have failed to account for variation in mating frequency across experimental treatments. Recently, it has been shown that multiply sired litters are common in natural populations of house mice, suggesting that female mice are actively polyandrous and sperm competition occurs in this species. Here we show that female house mice mated to 3 males (polyandry) had greater postbirth pup survival than females mated 3 times to the same male (monandry). Remote behavioral observations revealed that copulation frequency did not differ across our experimental treatments. We discuss this result with reference to genetic benefit hypotheses for the evolution of polyandry. Furthermore, by genotyping parents and offspring in the polyandrous treatment, we assessed which male reproductive traits contributed to paternity. We found that the first principal component describing variation in 10 male reproductive variables explained a significant proportion of the variation in paternity when males were second to mate. This component was weighted predominantly by measures of sperm length, suggesting that males with short sperm may be more successful when engaging in a disfavored role of sperm competition.

AB Following the creation of new land surfaces, there is in initial build-up phase of ecosystem development, but after a prolonged absence of major disturbance a retrogressive (decline) phase often follows due to reduced nutrient availability over time. Although many studies have considered how the soil community changes during the build-up phase, the response of this community to the retrogressive phase is poorly known. We measured litter and soil communities of microfauna and macrofauna along the Franz Josef Glacier chronosequence ill New Zealand that spans ca. 120,000 years, and includes well-established build-up and retrogressive stages. We aimed to assess whether the abundances, community Structure and diversity of these groups show the same pattern across the sequence as that for vegetation. With regard to microfaunal abundances, litter-dwelling microbe-feeding nematodes were most abundant in the first stage of the chronosequence, but several other groups of microfauna ill both the soil and litter increased sharply during the first few stages and declined sharply during the last (retrogressive) stages. The ratios of bacterial- to fungal-feeding nematodes in both soil and litter were lowest for the filial stages of the chronosequence, and (ill the case of soil) for some of the early stages, pointing to domination by the fungal-based energy channel at those stages for which soil organic matter content or quality were lowest. This is consistent with the fungal-based energy channel being better adapted than the bacterial-based channel for resource-poor conditions. The main groups of macroinvertebrates typically had their lowest abundances at the very early and late stages of the chronosequence, although the relative abundances of different taxa differed during the intermediate stages. Taxonomic diversity of nematodes and macroinvertebrates ill both litter and soil varied strongly with chronosequence stage but differed among taxa; diversity of only one group (macroinvertebrates ill litter) declined significantly during retrogression. Diversity of nematodes and macroinvertebrates along the sequence did not closely match tree diversity or soil chemical properties, but community composition of these groups was often related to tree community composition and ratios of soil C to N, C to P and N to P. Different groups of soil invertebrates show contrasting responses to chronosequence stage, probably because they differ in their relative response to bottom-up and top-down controls. However, the abundance of most groups increased during the build-up phase and declined during retrogression. As such, the build-up and decline phases observed for plant communities and ecosystem processes across long-term chronosequences also apply to soil communities, pointing to the importance of resource availability as a major driver of soil biota during long-term ecosystem change.

AB The common or brown shrimp Crangon crangon (L.) is a highly abundant and important taxon, both ecologically and commercially, yet knowledge on its population structure and historical biogeography is limited. We studied population genetic structure across the distribution range of this species by sequencing a 388 bp fragment of the cytochrome-c-oxidase I gene for 140 individuals from 25 locations. Strong population structuring and high levels of genetic diversity were observed. Four main phylogroups were uncovered: northeastern Atlantic, western Mediterranean, Adriatic Sea and Black Sea. Gene flow of these shrimp across known oceanographical barriers (e.g., the Strait of Gibraltar and/or Oran-Almeria front, Sicilian Straits, and Turkish Straits) is severely restricted. The oldest and most variable populations currently inhabit the western Mediterranean. The observed absence of structure across the entire northeastern Atlantic shelf is proposed not to be due to gene flow, but to relatively recent colonization following the glacial cycles of the late Pleistocene. Black Sea shrimp are currently disconnected from Mediterranean populations, and colonization is inferred, on the basis of coalescent analysis, to have happened relatively recently, but Possibly earlier than 7000 years ago. We postulate the hypothesis that C crangon survived the last brackish-water (<7 parts per thousand) period inside the Black Sea and/or one of the adjacent inland seas. We conclude that (1) common shrimp populations from different basins are strongly differentiated, (2) gene flow across basins is probably very limited, and (3) the biogeographic history of the taxon is largely in accordance with the geographic history of its distribution range. This study provides further evidence that high population connectivity of marine species (e.g., by policy makers) should not be assumed. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Within the New World nine-primaried oscine assemblage, feeding morphology and behavior have long been used as a guideline for assigning membership to subgroups. For example, birds with stout, conical bills capable of crushing heavy seeds have generally been placed within the tribe Cardinalini (cardinal-grosbeaks). Many workers have tried to characterize this group more definitively, using a variety of morphological characters; however, the characters used often conflicted with one another. Previous molecular studies addressing the monophyly of Cardinalini have had only limited sampling within the group. In this study, we analyze mtDNA sequence data from all genera and 34 of the 42 Cardinalini species (sensu [Sibley, C.G., Monroe, B.L., 1990. Distribution and Taxonomy of the Birds of the World, Yale University Press, New Haven, CT]) to address the monophyly of the group and to reconstruct the most complete phylogeny of this tribe published to date. We found strong support for a redefined Cardinalini that now includes some members previously placed within Thraupini (tanagers; the genera Piranga, Habia, Chlorothraupis, and Amaurospiza) and some members previously placed within the Parulini (wood-warblers; the genus Granatellus). In addition, some genera traditionally considered members of the Cardinalini are shown to have affinities with other groups (the genera Porphyrospiza, Parkerthraustes, and Saltator). Our redefined Cardinalini contains 48 species, six more than are listed in Sibley and Monroe's (1990) taxonomy of the group. Within the nine-primaried oscine assemblage, the Cardinalini are more closely related to the Thraupini (tanagers) than they are to the Emberizini (sparrows), Parulini (wood-warblers), or Iceterini (blackbirds), consistently forming a monophyletic group with Thraupini across all analyses. The reconfigured Cardinalini is comprised of five well-supported, major clades: (1) a "masked" clade (Piranga, Cardinalis, Caryothraustes, Periporphyrus, and Rhodothraupis), (2) a "blue" clade (Amaurospiza, Cyanocompsa, Cyanoloxia, Passerina, and Spiza), (3) a clade containing the genera Habia and Chlorothraupis, (4) a clade containing all species of Granatellus, and (5) a clade containing only species of Pheucticus. Diversification of these five lineages from one another occurred relatively rapidly during the mid-Pliocene, around 5 or 8 million years ago. Each of these major clades includes both North and South American species; thus, a complex biogeographic history is inferred for the group. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Traffic collisions can be a major source of mortality in wild populations, and animals may be expected to exhibit behavioral mechanisms that reduce the risk associated with crossing roads. Animals living in urban areas in particular have to negotiate very dense road networks, often with high levels of traffic flow. We examined traffic-related mortality of red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) in the city of Bristol, UK, and the extent to which roads affected fox activity by comparing real and randomly generated patterns of movement. There were significant seasonal differences in the number of traffic-related fox deaths for different age and sex classes; peaks were associated with periods when individuals were likely to be moving through unfamiliar terrain and would have had to cross major roads. Mortality rates per unit road length increased with road magnitude. The number of roads crossed by foxes and the rate at which roads were crossed per hour of activity increased after midnight when traffic flow was lower. Adults and juveniles crossed 17% and 30% fewer roads, respectively, than expected from randomly generated movement. This highly mobile species appeared to reduce the mortality risk of minor category roads by changing its activity patterns, but it remained vulnerable to the effects of larger roads with higher traffic flows during periods associated with extraterritorial movements.

ID MANAGEMENT
AB We investigated a fisher knowledge generation process in the longline fishery for large pelagic fish in Gouyave, Grenada, using techniques of participant observation, interviews, and focus group discussion. We identified nine categories of knowledge that are important for finding and catching large pelagic fish: seasons, use of bait, gear technology, weather conditions, fishing practice, fish habits and behaviour, fish movement, 'folk oceanography' (seabirds, seawater colour, current), and fish stomach contents. Conceptualized as a decision-making rule structure, this information can be analyzed as an expert system, the rationale being to understand how human experts (fishers) use technological and ecological knowledge. We extract heuristic rules (expressed as IF-THEN clauses) based on fishers' description of how they make decision on how, where, and when to find and catch fish. Gouyave fishers are adaptive experts because they have the ability to learn from and deal with new situations. They rely on observation, experimentation, and experience through the feedback of fish catches and evaluation, learning adaptively to improve their understanding of the marine ecosystem and the resource.

AB Balaenoptera omurai, formerly classified as a small form of Bryde's whale, was recently reclassified as a new baleen whale species of the family Balaenopteridae. Although researchers have investigated the evolutionary history of Balaenopteridae and their relatives using molecular phylogenetic methods, the taxonomy of the ordinary Bryde's whale (Balaenoptera brydei) and small-form Bryde's whales (Balaenoptera edeni and B. omurai) remains unclear. We have used complete mtDNA sequences and short interspersed repetitive element (SINE) insertion patterns to construct the evolutionary history of both B. omurai and the taxonomically redefined species, R edeni. The combined results demonstrate that B. omurai forms a monophyletic lineage with B. musculus, B. brydei, B. edeni and B. borealis and that B. omurai and B. musculus successively diverged from their common ancestor. In addition, we also showed that B. edeni constitutes a sister taxon to B. brydei. Our data suggest that B. omurai evolved as an ancient independent lineage that diverged much earlier than B. borealis, B. brydei and B. edeni, which were previously believed to be closely related to B. omurai.

   Loggerhead Seaturtle, Caretta caretta
SO JOURNAL OF HERPETOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID EGG-LAYING TRENDS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SEA-TURTLES; TEMPERATURE; REPTILES
AB Evidence is mounting that warming air and sea temperatures are affecting nesting patterns in oviparous species by causing earlier nesting within seasons. The potential fitness consequences of nesting earlier include extended periods of offspring growth and larger clutch sizes. Additionally, the potential for nesting seasons to last longer exists, possibly allowing species that lay multiple clutches within a season to increase the number of clutches produced. To date, no studies have examined consequences of earlier nesting on duration of nesting season in oviparous vertebrates. We demonstrate that warmer sea surface temperatures are related to earlier nesting in the Loggerhead Seaturtle Caretta caretta, and that this response actually decreases, rather than increases, the length of the nesting season. In recent years (1995-2003), nesting became more evenly distributed throughout the season than in earlier years (1989-1994), and the nesting season decreased by approximately 43 days. Female turtles are unlikely to produce additional clutches within a reproductive season in response to this effect because of physiological constraints, and we cannot rule out the hypothesis that female turtles will lay fewer clutches because of a shortened nesting season, leading to reduced fecundity within seasons.

AB Reducing the biological diversity of a community may decrease its resistance to invasion by exotic species. Manipulative experiments typically support this hypothesis but have focused mainly on one trophic level (i.e., primary producers). To date, we know little about how positive interactions among species may influence the relationship between diversity and invasibility, which suggests a need for research that addresses the question: under what conditions does diversity affect resistance to invasion? We used experimental manipulations of both plant diversity and the presence of an endophytic fungus to test whether a fungal mutualist of an invasive grass species (Lolium arundinaceum) switches the relationship between plant community diversity and resistance to invasion. Association with the fungal endophyte (Neotyphodium coenophialum) increased the ability of L. arundinaceum to invade communities with greater species diversity. In the absence of the endophyte, the initial diversity of the community significantly reduced the establishment of L. arundinaceum. However, establishment was independent of initial diversity in the presence of the endophyte. Fungal symbionts, like other key species, are often overlooked in studies of plant diversity, yet their presence may explain variation among studies in the effect of diversity on resistance to invasion.

AB The nocturnally foraging cardinalfishes are known to exhibit a high degree of fidelity to their daytime resting sites. However, the microhabitats chosen as resting sites, the degree of specialisation on live coral substrata and the degree of overlap among apogonid species have not been described, These patterns potentially affect how declining coral availability will impact the diversity and abundance of apogonid assemblages. Here, microhabitat use, abundances and patterns of cooccurrence are examined for 10 common reef-dwelling apogonids in Kimbe Bay, Papua New Guinea. Nine of the 10 species were strongly associated with live scleractinian corals, with more than 80 % of the individuals resting in branching forms. The exception was Apogon nigrofasciatus, a specialist on cave or crevice habitats. Among the available coral species, the vast majority of cardinalfishes were associated with a single coral species (Porites cylindrica), although the degree of specialisation varied among species. Apogon leptacanthus and Sphaeramia nematoptera were almost always only found on P. cylindrica, while Apogon bandanensis, Apogon compressus, Apogon fragilis, Archamia fucata, Archamia zosterophora, Cheilodipterus artus and C. quinquelineatus also used a range of other corals. There was a positive relationship between the range of substratum types used and the number of groups of each species observed. The 9 coral-dwelling apogonids exhibited a high degree of overlap in depth range and in the use of coral microhabitats. Over 75 % of aggregations were made up of more than one fish species. The high level of both specialisation and overlap in habitat use suggests that the future biodiversity of cardinalfishes in Kimbe Bay could be linked to the fate of a single coral species.

AB Comparative phylogeography can reveal processes and historical events that shape the biodiversity of species and communities. As part of a comparative research program, the phylogeography of a new, endemic Australian genus and species of log-dependent (saproxylic) collembola was investigated using mitochondrial sequences, allozymes and anonymous single-copy nuclear markers. We found the genetic structure of the species corresponds with five a priori microbiogeographical regions, with population subdivision at various depths owing to palaeoclimatic influences. Closely related mtDNA haplotypes are codistributed within a single region or occur in adjacent regions, nuclear allele frequencies are more similar among more proximate populations, and interpopulation migration is rare. Based on mtDNA divergence, a late Miocene-late Pliocene coalescence is likely. The present-day distribution of genetic diversity seems to have been impacted by three major climatic events: Pliocene cooling and drying (2.5-7 million years before present, Mybp), early Pleistocene wet-dry oscillations (c. 1.2 Mybp) and the more recent glacial-interglacial cycles that have characterized the latter part of the Quaternary (< 0.4 Mybp).

AB How sterile, altruistic worker castes have evolved in social insects and how they are maintained have long been central topics in evolutionary biology. With the advance of kin selection theory, insect societies, in particular those of haplodiploid bees, ants, and wasps, have become highly suitable model systems for investigating the details of social evolution and recently also how within-group conflicts are resolved. Because insect societies typically do not consist of clones, conflicts among nestmates arise, for example about the partitioning of reproduction and the allocation of resources towards male and female sexuals. Variation in relatedness among group members therefore appears to have a profound influence on the social structure of groups. However, insect societies appear to be remarkably robust against such variation: division of labor and task allocation are often organized in more or less the same way in societies with high as in those with very low nestmate relatedness. To explain the discrepancy between predictions from kin structure and empirical data, it was suggested that constraints-such as the lack of power or information-prevent individuals from pursuing their own selfish interests. Applying a multilevel selection approach shows that these constraints are in fact group-level adaptation preventing or resolving intracolonial conflict. The mechanisms of conflict resolution in insect societies are similar to those at other levels in the biological hierarchy (e.g., in the genome or multicellular organisms): alignment of interests, fair lottery, and social control. Insect societies can thus be regarded as a level of selection with novelties that provide benefits beyond the scope of a solitary life. Therefore, relatedness is less important for the maintenance of insect societies, although it played a fundamental role in their evolution.

AB The evolution of female multiple mating is a highly controversial topic, especially in social insects. Here we analyze, using comparative analyses and simulation models, the merits of two major contending hypotheses for the adaptive value of polyandry in this group. The hypotheses maintain that, respectively, the resulting genotypic diversity among offspring within a colony: (1) mitigates against the effects of parasites; or (2) favors adaptive division of labor. Only two of 11 phylogenetically uncontrolled comparative analyses supported an association between polyandry and the complexity of division of labor (measured here using worker caste polymorphism or polyethism) as proposed by hypothesis 2, and after controlling for phylogeny there were no significant associations. In contrast, a previous study demonstrated such an association for parasite load as expected under hypothesis 1. In addition, we used simulation models to track the spread of an initially rare allele for double mating in a population of single-mating alleles, thus analyzing the crucial first step from monandry to polyandry. We find that double mating evolves consistently under antagonistic coevolution given that parasites exert sufficient selection intensity. In contrast, selection for enhanced division of labor resulted in only an erratic appearance of polyandry in highly (and mostly negatively) autocorrelated environments where no coevolutionary dynamics were allowed. Together, we interpret these results to suggest that parasites, and the antagonistic coevolutionary pressures they exert, may play an important role in the evolution of polyandry in social hymenopteran populations.

AB The presence of morphologically cryptic lineages within the threatened brown kiwi of New Zealand has confounded their taxonomy. Recent genetic studies ( Herbert and Daugherty 1994; Baker et al. 1995) revealed that at least two phylogenetic species exist within the brown kiwi, and suggested that further research should resolve the taxonomic problems. In this paper we extend genetic analyses to include sequences from 58 brown kiwi representing five phylogenetic lineages for four mitochondrial loci ( control region, cytochrome b, ATPase 6 and ATPase 8). Major lineages of brown kiwi are shown to be reciprocally monophyletic, and align with other biological differences in the ecology, behavior, morphology and parasites of kiwi. Because mtDNA sequences of major lineages of kiwi are not evolving in a clocklike manner, we used a new penalized likelihood method with rate- smoothing to date the divergence of North Island brown kiwi and the geographically isolated Okarito population ( rowi) at about 6.2 Mya. These lineages diverged about 8.2 Mya from the brown kiwi in Fiordland and Haast in the southern part of the South Island, and are thus older than the species of spotted kiwi ( 5.8 Mya). Given their distinctness, long- term geographical isolation, lack of hybridization in introduced populations, and accumulation of new biological characters within these lineages, we hypothesize that reproductive incompatibilities have probably arisen as well. We therefore recommend that these divergent lineages be formally recognized as full species; Apteryx mantelli should be re- instated for the North Island brown kiwi, A. australis should be restricted to the tokoeka, and a new species A. rowii should be erected to describe the rowi at Okarito. Tokoeka should be split into at least three conservation management units ( Haast, Fiordland and Stewart Island [ Rakiura]), but further research is required to determine the exact relationships and status of these lineages. Further investigation is also required into the genetic structuring of the North Island brown kiwi to confirm conservation management units on the North Island.

AB Co-adaptations, co-evolution, and co-speciation between herbivores and their host plants have been topics of interest for several decades. Difficulties in deciphering these relationships as well as physiological, biochemical, and ecological adaptations of herbivorous insects themselves are discussed here in relation to biotic and abiotic environmental factors that create temporal as well as spatial mosaics of genetic variation. Hybridization was shown in swallowtail butterflies (Papilio) (Lepidoptera: Papilionidae) to produce some trait concordance, but mostly independent geographic trait clines (physiological, biochemical, and morphological). Strong and extensive genetic introgression of Liriodendron tulipifera detoxification abilities was documented northward across the hybrid zone, presumably as a result of regional climate warming only during the last 3-4 years. These and other genetic novelties produced by hybridization may be important in speciation processes, and they also emphasize the difficulties identifying appropriate taxonomic classifications for discussing any species concept. Host plant detoxification abilities (as 'key innovations') are shown capable of rapid movement between different polyphagous herbivore species independently of the host plant availability and well beyond the insect species geographical range distribution. Part of the difficulty associated with ecologically categorizing herbivore species and identifying affiliated adaptations for host plant use may be related to independent movement of various 'species-diagnostic' traits. Climate-driven local selection regimes could help generate the dynamic variation observed for co-adapted, co-evolved, or non-adapted genotypes, and may produce the confusing and changing patterns of geographic mosaics seen within and among closely related herbivores. Experimental analyses of several factors that could explain the asymmetrical shapes of trait clines across the hybrid zone for tiger swallowtail butterflies are discussed.

AB The effect of ambient and elevated atmospheric CO2 on biomass partitioning and nutrient uptake of mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal pea plants grown in pots in a controlled environment was studied. The hypothesis tested was that mycorrhizae would increase C assimilation by increasing photosynthetic rates and reduce below-ground biomass allocation by improving nutrient uptake. This effect was expected to be more pronounced at elevated CO2 where plant C supply and nutrient demand would be increased. The results showed that mycorrhizae did not interact with atmospheric CO2 concentration in the variables measured. Mycorrhizae did not affect photosynthetic rates, had no effect on root weight or root length density and almost no effect on nutrient uptake, but still significantly increased shoot weight and reduced root/shoot ratio at harvest. Elevated CO2 increased photosynthetic rates with no evidence for downregulation, increased shoot weight and nutrient uptake, had no effect on root weight, and actually reduced root/shoot ratio at harvest. Non-mycorrhizal plants growing at both CO2 concentrations had lower shoot weight than mycorrhizal plants with similar nutritional status and photosynthetic rates. It is suggested that the positive effect of mycorrhizal inoculation was caused by an enhanced C supply and C use in mycorrhizal plants than in non-mycorrhizal plants. The results indicate that plant growth was not limited by mineral nutrients, but partially source and sink limited for carbon. Mycorrhizal inoculation and elevated CO2 might have removed such limitations and their effects on above-ground biomass were independent, positive and additive.

AB Nucleotide sequences of the mitochondrial protein coding cytochrome b (cyt b; 650 bp) and small-subunit 12S ribosomal RNA (similar to 350 bp) genes were used in analyses of phylogenetic relationships among extant phrynosomatid sand lizards, including an examination of competing hypotheses regarding the evolution of "earlessness." Sequences were obtained from all currently recognized species of sand lizards as well as representatives of the first and second outgroups and analyzed using both parsimony and likelihood methods. The cyt b data offer strong support for relationships that correspond with relatively recent divergences and moderate to low support for relationships reflecting more ancient divergences within the clade. These data support monophyly of the "earless" taxa, the placement of Uma as the sister taxon to the other sand lizards, and monophyly of all four taxa traditionally ranked as genera. All well-supported relationships in the 12S phylogeny are completely congruent with well-supported relationships in the cyt b phylogeny; however, the 12S data alone provide very little support for deeper divergences. Phylogenetic relationships within species are concordant with geography and suggest patterns of phylogeographic differentiation, including the conclusion that at least one currently recognized species (Holbrookia maculata) actually consists of more than one species; By independently optimizing likelihood model parameters for various subsets of the data, we found that nucleotide substitution processes vary widely between genes and among the structural and functional regions or classes of sites within each gene. Therefore, we compared competing phylogenetic hypotheses, using parameter estimates specific to those subsets, analyzing the subsets separately and in various combinations. The hypothesis supported by the cyt b data was favored over rival hypotheses in all but one of the five comparisons made with the entire data set, including the set of partitions that best explained the data, although we were unable to confidently reject (P < 0.05) alternative hypotheses. Our results highlight the importance of optimizing models and parameter estimates for different genes or parts thereof-a strategy that takes advantages of the strengths of both combining and partitioning data.

AB This paper deals with changes in leaf photosynthetic capacity with depth in a rose (Rosa hybrida cv. Sonia) plant canopy. Measurements of leaf net CO2 assimilation (A(l)) and total nitrogen content (N-l) were performed in autumn under greenhouse conditions on mature leaves located at different layers within the plant canopy, including the flower stems and the main shoots. These leaves were subjected (i) to contrasting levels of CO2 partial pressure (p(a)) at saturating photosynthetic photon flux density (I about 1000 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) and (ii) to saturating CO2 partial pressure (p(a) about 100 Pa) and varying I, while conditions of temperature were those prevailing in the greenhouse (20-38 degrees C). A biochemical model of leaf photosynthesis relating A(l) to intercellular CO2 partial pressure (p(i)) was parameterized for each layer of leaves, supplying corresponding values of the photosynthetic Rubisco capacity (V-lm) and the maximum rate of electron transport (J(m)). The results indicated that rose leaves growing at the top of the canopy had higher values of J(m) and V-lm, which resulted from a higher allocation of nitrogen to the uppermost leaves. Mean values of total leaf nitrogen, N-l, decreased about 35% from the uppermost leaves of flower stem to leaves growing at the bottom of the plant. The derived values of non-photosynthetic nitrogen, N-b, varied from 76 mmol(N) m(leaf)(-2) (layer 1) to 60 mmol(N) m(leaf)(-2) (layer 4), representing a large fraction of N-l (50 and 60% in layer 1 and 4, respectively). Comparison of leaf photosynthetic nitrogen (N-p = N-l - N-b) and I profiles supports the hypothesis that rose leaves acclimate to the time-integrated absorbed I. The relationships between I and N-p, obtained during autumn, spring and summer, indicate that rose leaves seem also to acclimate their photosynthetic capacity seasonally, by allocating more photosynthetic nitrogen to leaves in autumn and spring than in summer.

AB The investigation of mtDNA disease can be relatively straightforward if a person has a recognisable phenotype and if it is possible to identify a known pathogenic mtDNA mutation. The difficulties arise when no known mtDNA defect can be found, or when the clinical abnormalities are complex and not easily matched to those of the more common mitochondrial disorders. We will describe here the difficulties that can be encountered during the identification of pathogenic mtDNA mutations and the approaches that can be used to confirm, or eliminate, a likely pathogenic role, in either single gene diseases or in multifactorial disorders.

AB To improve efficiency of soil N and water use in the savanna, maize (Zea mays L.) cultivars with improved root systems are required. Two rainfed field experiments were conducted in Samaru, Nigeria in the 1993 and 1994 growing seasons with five maize cultivars under various rates of nitrogen fertilizer. The capacity of maize for rapid early root growth and to later develop a deep, dense root system was assessed. In addition, the effect of N fertilization on root growth of maize was studied in 1994. The widely cultivated cultivar TZB-SR had a poor root system in the surface soil layer and was more susceptible to early-season drought, as indicated by low plant vigor and aboveground dry matter yield during that time. It had a lower grain yield and a relatively small harvest index, but ranked among the highest in total aboveground dry matter production compared to other cultivars. The size of root system alone did not always relate well with grain yield among cultivars. Partitioning of dry matter within the plant was important in determining differences in grain yield and N stress tolerance between cultivars. A semiprolific cultivar (SPL) had high seedling vigour and a dense root system in the surface soil layer that conferred a greater tolerance to early-season drought stress and improved uptake of the early-season N flush, as indicated by a greater dry matter yield at 35 days after sowing (DAS). It also had a fine, deep, dense root system at flowering that could have improved water- and N-use efficiency in the subsoil (> 45 cm), thereby avoiding midseason drought stress in 1994. SPL had a large harvest index and the greatest yield among cultivars in 1994. Averaged across cultivars, greater root growth and distribution was observed at a moderate N rate of 0.56 g plant(-1) than at zero-N or high N (2.26 g plant(-1)). Differences in root morphology could be valuable as selection criteria for N-efficient and drought-tolerant maize. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Approximately 50% of matings in the frog Crinia georgiana involve two or more males. We report reduced fertilization success as a major cost of mating with multiple males. For single-male matings, fertilization success was consistently high averaging 96%. Only 68% of eggs were fertilized when females were amplexed by two males and this dropped to 64% when females were amplexed by three to five males, Multiple regression analysis revealed thr reduction in fertilization success was significantly related to the number of amplectant males but not to clutch size or three measures of water quality (depth, temperature and oxygen concentration) at the site of oviposition. The most likely cause of reduced fertilization success is struggles amongst males which interfere with effective sperm transfer.

AB Chlorarachniophytes are a group of algae that acquired their chloroplasts by a eukaryote-eukaryote endosymbiosis (secondary endosymbiosis) between a protozoan and a green alga. The green algal endosymbiont still keeps its own nucleus as a reduced form, called a nucleomorph, that contains the smallest eukaryotic genome. We sequenced both nuclear and nucleomorph small-subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU rRNA) genes from seven chlorarachniophyte strains. In order to examine the origins of this algal group in more detail and clarify their phylogenetic relationship and morphological diversification, we performed molecular phylogenetic analyses of their nuclear and nucleomorph SSU rRNA genes with maximum-likelihood, maximum-parsimony, and neighbor-joining methods. The results show that chlorarachniophytes evolved from a single secondary endosymbiosis and suggest that the endosymbiont was an ulvophycean green alga. They also confirm that the host was related to monadofilosans (sarcomonad flagellates and euglyphid amoebae). Nuclear and nucleomorph trees are largely congruent, and both show the same five major chlorarachniophyte lineages. However, nucleotide substitution rates of nucleomorph rRNA genes were much higher than those of the nuclear genes. The four known types of pyrenoid ultrastructure map onto the molecular tree in such a way that each had only a single origin, indicating that these ultrastructural differences among the endosymbionts are reliable indicators of their phylogenetic relationship. Mapping overall cell morphology onto the tree suggests that at least four losses of the amoeboid stage of the life cycle, two losses of cell walls, and two losses of phagotrophy may have occurred independently in the evolution of the chlorarachniophytes.

AB A manipulative experiment was done to test hypotheses about the interactive effects of shading and proximity to the seafloor on the development of subtidal epibiotic assemblages. It was pro posed that differences in these 2 factors could explain differences described previously between assemblages of sessile organisms on rocky reefs and pier pilings in estuaries. Sandstone settlement plates were deployed in 2 positions (close to and far from the seafloor) and sets of plates were experimentally shaded in each position. Effects of shading and proximity to the seafloor were apparent after 12 wk and many persisted for all 33 wk of the experiment. Largest differences in assemblages were due to position relative to the seafloor (which greatly affected the cover of spirorbid polychaetes, barnacles, bryozoans and sponges) and there was a significant multivariate effect of shading on assemblages close to the seafloor. Shading influenced the cover of colonial ascidians, algae and cyanobacteria in both positions, but many other taxa in only 1 position. Possible reasons for these differences are discussed. Results suggested that differences in assemblages between rocky reefs and pilings could largely be due to differences in shading and proximity to the seafloor.

AB Rates of light-saturated net photosynthesis (P-N max) and dark respiration (Rd) on a leaf area basis, leaf dry mass per area (LMA), leaf nitrogen content on a leaf area basis (LNa) and instantaneous nitrogen use efficiency (NUE = P-N max/LNa) were followed during leaf development in six evergreen broad-leaved tree species typical of warm-temperate forests in Japan. These species were Castanopsis sieboldii, Quercus myrsinaefolia, Quercus glauca, Machilus thunbergii, Cinnamomum japonicum and Neolitsea sericea. When expansion of leaf area was complete, P-N max was about one third of its peak value and increased for another 15 to 44 d. Rd at full leaf expansion was about 1.5 to 3.5-times greater than steady-state rates. These facts suggest that leaf development was still underway at the time of full leaf area expansion. Low P-N max at full leaf expansion was caused both by low leaf nitrogen content and low NUE. P-N max increased with the increase in LMA during leaf development in all six species; data from the literature for other species with different life forms also indicated a similar tendency. The steady-state LMA varied markedly among species. Because leaves with larger steady-state LMAs need more resources for their construction, they will also need longer periods for maturation. We hypothesized that the period required for the attainment of peak P-N max, the 'leaf maturation period', depends on the steady-state LMA. Plotting data from the present study together with those from literature for other plants across several life forms sheared a strong positive relationship between leaf maturation period and steady-state LMA, supporting the hypothesis.

AB MtDNA sequencing was used to assess the phylogeographic structure of four species of Hawaiian freshwater fishes: Lentipes concolor, Stenogobius hawaiiensis, Sicyopterus stimpsoni, and Awaous guamensis. Samples of each species were collected from streams on the northeast side of Kauai, Maul, Molokai, Oahu, and Hawaii. We sequenced segments from both coding and noncoding regions (638-1391 bp) in each species. Sequence analysis uncovered genetic variability in these fishes but no evidence of strong geographic structure among island populations. This result is most readily explained by the fishes' larval marine life stage (amphidromy), which likely facilitates gene flow among island populations. By constraining genetic differentiation among populations, amphidromy may impede speciation in these fishes, possibly explaining why the Hawaiian freshwater fish fauna is depauperate compared to other species-rich Hawaiian faunas. It may also provide them with a kind of evolutionary flexibility atypical of other, more isolated island faunas and allow natural restocking to occur in streams that have been restored to suitable conditions. Comparisons of restriction site and sequence data suggested similar population genetic conclusions for all species except S. stimpsoni, for which the restriction site data is questioned.

AB The spatial distribution of plant-available mineral nutrients in forest soils is often highly heterogeneous. To test the hypothesis that local nutrient enrichment of soil leads to increased root proliferation in the nutrient-rich soil zone, we studied the effects of nutrient enrichment on the growth and nutrient concentrations of Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) France), Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) roots. Three-year-old seedlings were grown for 9 months in split-root containers filled with nutrient-poor forest mineral soil, with one side supplemented with additional mineral nutrients. Root dry weight and root length in Scots pine and Norway spruce were increased in the nutrient-supplemented soil compared with the nonsupplemented side, whereas root growth in Douglas-fir was unaffected by nutrient enrichment. Of the three species examined, Norway spruce exhibited the highest root and shoot growth and the highest nutrient demand. Specific root length (m g(-1)) and the number of root tips per unit root length were not affected by local nutrient addition in any of the species. Despite increased root growth in Norway spruce and Scots pine in nutrient-supplemented soil, their root systems contained similar nutrient concentrations on both sides of the split-root container. Thus, coniferous trees may respond to local nutrient supply by increased root proliferation, but the response varies depending on the species, and may only occur when trees are nutrient deficient. As a response to local nutrient enrichment, increases in root dry matter or root length may be better indicators of pre-existing nutrient deficiencies in conifers than increases in root nutrient concentrations.

AB Aphids and their predators were studied in an apple orchard near Berne, Switzerland. To augment the density of the predators of aphids weed strips were sown in tramlines and along the border parallel to the first and the last row of trees in one half of the orchard (the other half served as control) in April 1992. Weekly visual observations, monthly beating-tray samples, branch samples in winter, and assessment of the density of spider webs and their trapping efficiency on randomly chosen trees were carried out in 1993. During 1993, significant differences in the number of aphids, aphidophagous insects, and spiders were observed on the apple trees within both the strip-managed area and the control area. The impact on aphids by the aphidophagous insects was important during the flowering time of weeds in spring and summer. In autumn, however, spiders (i.e. Araniella spp.) were the dominant predators of aphids on the trees; during this time of the year they were more abundant within the strip-managed area of the orchard. With a higher density of webs, spiders significantly reduced the number of aphids able to return from their summer host plants. Consequently, less hatching aphids were found on branch samples of the strip-managed area compared to the control area. The effects of the weed strips on spiders and aphidophagous insects, and the resulting impact of predation on the aphids are discussed.

AB Field experiments were conducted for 6 years on a silty clay loam to study the effect of soil management on soil physical properties, root growth, nutrient uptake and yield of rainfed maize (Zea mays L.) and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) grown in a sequence. Treatments were: no-tillage (NT), NT+pine needle mulch at a rate of 10 t ha(-1) (NT+M), conventional tillage (CT), CT+pine needle mulch at a rate of 10 t ha(-1) (CT+M) and deep tillage (DT). The soil is classified as a Typic Hapludalf and has compact sub-surface layers. The NT treatment increased the bulk density of the surface layer but this problem was not observed in the no-tilled treatment having mulch at the surface (NT+M). The CT+M and NT+M treatments favourably moderated the hydro-thermal regime resulting in greater root growth, nutrient uptake and grain yields of maize and wheat. The DT treatment, imposed only once, at the beginning of the study, also enhanced root growth and grain yields. The yields were similar to the mulched treatments for maize and somewhat less than the mulched treatments for wheat. Mulched treatments generally showed significantly greater total uptake of N, P and K than corresponding unmulched ones. Since NT+M was comparable to CT for maize and superior for wheat, the latter is preferable since it does not require elaborate tillage.

AB The availability of reef-related resources, particularly food and shelter can play a significant role in determining the distribution and abundance of reef fishes. Much of the structure on temperate reefs is provided by macroalgae, and variability in the density of temperate reef fishes at large spatial scales (100's of meters) can often be explained by variation in macroalgal cover or density. In this study I investigated the role of macrophytes and associated food resources on the recruitment of a temperate fish, Tautogolabrus adspersus, at a small spatial scale (0.25 m(2)). No relationship between the density of new recruits and the percent cover of kelp, foliose or filamentous algae was observed. Multiple regressions revealed that less than 8% of variability in recruitment could be explained by variability in macroalgal cover. However, recruits were found in higher abundance in patches containing many functional forms of seaweeds than in patches dominated by a single form. A wide variety of prey were available for use by cunner recruits; however, crustaceans and mussels were the only common components of their diet, and crustaceans were clearly the most preferred prey. The prey composition in patches where fish were present was compared to randomly selected patches. Significantly greater numbers of isopods, amphipods and newly settled mussels were present in patches where fish were present than in randomly selected patches. The data presented in this study contradict previous work that has shown algal structure to be important in determining patterns of abundance and food supply to be of little significance. A conceptual model is proposed suggesting that settling fish select habitats in a hierarchical manner largely based on their dispersal tendencies. Hierarchical selection of habitats results in different attributes of the habitat being selected during different life-history intervals.

AB Females of dioecious species usually have higher reproductive effort than males because they produce fruits in addition to flowers. Since females have higher reproductive effort, they are expected to be more negatively affected than males by low resource availability. We tested that assumption by growing females and males of Silene latifolia under low levels of light, water, nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. Gas exchange of the sexes did not respond differently to low resource availability; higher female reproductive effort relative to males did not differentially affect their ability to assimilate carbon. However, male photosynthesis rates and stomatal conductances were slightly, but consistently, higher than those of females. The intersexual difference in photosynthesis rate may be a proximate result of reproduction if females translocate nutrients, particularly nitrogen, from their leaves to developing fruits. Alternatively (or perhaps additionally), higher male photosynthesis and stomatal conductances relative to females may be the ultimate result of sexual selection. This could be the case if 1) reproductive effort as estimated by biomass allocation is misleading and males actually invest more in reproduction than females, or 2) females experience stronger selection than males to conserve water late in the growing season, when soil moisture is likely to be low but females need to complete fruit maturation. Our results indicated that females had slightly lower leaf nitrogen but higher photosynthetic water-use efficiency than males, so it is possible that both proximate and ultimate factors are operating simultaneously to cause lower female photosynthesis rates.

AB The facultative hemiparasitic angiosperm Rhinanthus minor was grown on 11 different host species, and in the absence of a host. The height of R. minor parasitising the legume Trifolium pratense exceeded that of unattached plants by more than an order of magnitude, with performance on grasses and non-legume dicotlyedonous hosts between these two extremes. Light saturated rates of photosynthesis in R. minor on different hosts ranged from 1.5 to 22.5 mumol g-1 dry weight min-1, and were positively correlated with growth. Foliar nitrogen concentrations in the parasite exceeded those of the hosts. The former were positively related to light saturated rates of photosynthesis, and inversely related to photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency. There was no relationship between leaf nitrogen concentration and water use efficiency in R. minor. The data are discussed in relation to studies of nitrogen and water use in mistletoes.

AB The photosynthetic performances of two tropical tree species, a pioneer Nauclea diderrichii (De Wilde.) Merrill, and a climax species Entandrophragma angolense (Welw.) C. DC., both from West Africa, were compared. Young plants were grown in controlled environments where photon flux density and nutrient supply were varied. A/C(i) curves of the two species were very similar, both showing an increased initial slope and maximal rate of photosynthesis when the leaves had been grown at high photon flux density. Nutrient supply had a similar, but smaller, influence. However, the pioneer Nauclea showed a greater increase in initial slope in relation to both light and nutrient supply. It also showed greater anatomical response to light, developing a second layer of palisade mesophyll when grown at high photon flux density. Light response curves of photosynthesis were also determined. The apparent quantum efficiency was insensitive to growing conditions, but the carboxylation rate, dark respiration and light-saturated photosynthetic rate were sensitive to the light climate of growth. The pioneer Nauclea displayed an increase in assimilation rate as the photosynthetic photon flux density was increased beyond 300-mu-mol m-2 s-1, but Entandrophragma did not, and often showed a decline.

AB Genetic rescue - ameliorating inbreeding depression and restoring genetic diversity of inbred populations through gene flow - is valuable in wildlife conservation. Empirically validated recommendations for genetic rescue supported by evolutionary genetics theory advise maximizing genetic diversity in target populations. Instead, recent papers based on genomic studies of island foxes, Isle Royal wolves, and simulation modeling claim it would be preferable to minimize introduction of harmful variation by avoiding genetic rescue altogether or by selecting partially-inbred sources presumed to have fewer harmful alleles. We examined the assertions and evidence underlying these new recommendations. The claim that long-term persistence of a few small inbred populations invalidates the small population paradigm commits the survivorship fallacy by ignoring population extinctions through inbreeding. The claim that island foxes show no inbreeding depression conflicts with elevated levels of putatively harmful alleles, low fecundity, and island-specific disease susceptibilities. The claim that the history of Isle Royale wolves represents likely outcomes of genetic rescues using immigrants from larger source populations is invalid: the unplanned addition of a single male to an inbred population capped at similar to 25 individuals does not represent sound genetic rescue. The simulations in Robinson et al. (2018, 2019) and Kyriazis et al. (2019 pre-print) apply several unrealistic assumptions and parameter distributions that disfavor large, outbred sources for genetic rescue. Accordingly, the simulations' conclusions conflict profoundly with those of > 120 meta-analysed real datasets, and do not overturn current empirically validated recommendations to maximize genetic diversity in the target population.

AB Trap-based surveillance strategies are widely used for monitoring of invasive insect species, aiming to detect newly arrived exotic taxa as well as track the population levels of established or endemic pests. Where these surveillance traps have low specificity and capture non-target endemic species in excess of the target pests, the need for extensive specimen sorting and identification creates a major diagnostic bottleneck. While the recent development of standardized molecular diagnostics has partly alleviated this requirement, the single specimen per reaction nature of these methods does not readily scale to the sheer number of insects trapped in surveillance programmes. Consequently, target lists are often restricted to a few high-priority pests, allowing unanticipated species to avoid detection and potentially establish populations.
   DNA metabarcoding has recently emerged as a method for conducting simultaneous, multi-species identification of complex mixed communities and may lend itself ideally to rapid diagnostics of bulk insect trap samples. Moreover, the high-throughput nature of recent sequencing platforms could enable the multiplexing of hundreds of diverse trap samples on a single flow cell, thereby providing the means to dramatically scale up insect surveillance in terms of both the quantity of traps that can be processed concurrently and number of pest species that can be targeted. In this review of the metabarcoding literature, we explore how DNA metabarcoding could be tailored to the detection of invasive insects in a surveillance context and highlight the unique technical and regulatory challenges that must be considered when implementing high-throughput sequencing technologies into sensitive diagnostic applications.

AB Coastal tourism is a growing industry sector in the Mediterranean Basin. This and the other human activities occurring along the coastline share space and resources, leading to conflicts for divergent uses. Moreover, the over-exploitation of natural resources degrades and depletes coastal habitats, with negative feedback effects for all human activities. Hence, both tourism and the other human activities have to consider their dependence on coastal ecosystem services, and act at technical and policy level to reach a compromise that preserves natural resources in the long term. Here we provide a conceptual framework illustrating the complex relationships and trade-offs among threats from coastal tourism and from other human activities and coastal ecosystem services, with a focus on cultural ones. We discuss the negative feedbacks on tourism development and provide examples of geospatial analysis on cumulative threats generated by other human activities and affecting tourism itself. The proposed conceptual framework and the threat analysis aim at highlighting the negative feedback effects of human driven threats on the development of Mediterranean coastal tourism, through an ecosystem service perspective. Both tools provide valuable insight for supporting decision makers and planners in achieving integrated coastal management, with a focus on sustainable tourism. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB The coordinated distribution of nitrogen to source leaves and sinks is essential for supporting leaf metabolism while also supplying sufficient nitrogen to seeds for development. This study aimed to understand how regulated amino acid allocation to leaves affects photosynthesis and overall plant nitrogen use efficiency in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) and how soil nitrogen availability influences these processes. Arabidopsis plants with a knockout of AAP2, encoding an amino acid permease involved in xylem-to-phloem transfer of root-derived amino acids, were grown in low-, moderate-, and high-nitrogen environments. We analyzed nitrogen allocation to shoot tissues, photosynthesis, and photosynthetic and plant nitrogen use efficiency in these knockout plants. Our results demonstrate that, independent of nitrogen conditions, aap2 plants allocate more nitrogen to leaves than wild-type plants. Increased leaf nitrogen supply positively affected chlorophyll and Rubisco levels, photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency, and carbon assimilation and transport to sinks. The aap2 plants outperformed wild-type plants with respect to growth, seed yield and carbon storage pools, and nitrogen use efficiency in both high and deficient nitrogen environments. Overall, this study demonstrates that increasing nitrogen allocation to leaves represents an effective strategy for improving carbon fixation and photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency. The results indicate that an optimized coordination of nitrogen and carbon partitioning processes is critical for high oilseed production in Arabidopsis, including in plants exposed to limiting nitrogen conditions.

AB Canopy chlorophyll content (Chl) closely relates to plant photosynthetic capacity, nitrogen status and productivity. The goal of this study is to develop remote sensing techniques for accurate estimation of canopy Chl during the entire growing season without re-parameterization of algorithms for two contrasting crop species, maize and soybean. These two crops represent different biochemical mechanisms of photosynthesis, leaf structure and canopy architecture. The relationships between canopy Chl and reflectance, collected at close range and resampled to bands of the Multi Spectral Instrument (MSI) aboard Sentinel-2, were analyzed in samples taken across the entirety of the growing seasons in three irrigated and rainfed sites located in eastern Nebraska between 2001 and 2005. Crop phenology was a factor strongly influencing the reflectance of both maize and soybean. Substantial hysteresis of the reflectance vs. canopy Chl relationship existed between the vegetative and reproductive stages. The effect of the hysteresis on vegetation indices (VI), applied for canopy Chl estimation, depended on the bands used and their formulation. The hysteresis greatly affected the accuracy of canopy Chl estimation by widely-used VIs with near infrared (NIR) and red reflectance (e.g., normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and simple ratio (SR)). VIs that use red edge and NIR bands (e.g., red edge chlorophyll index (CIred edge), red edge NDVI and the MERIS terrestrial chlorophyll index (MTCI)) were minimally affected by crop phenology (i.e., they exhibited little hysteresis) and were able to accurately estimate canopy Chl in two crops without algorithm re-parameterization and, thus, were found to be the best candidates for generic algorithms to estimate crop Chl using the surface reflectance products of MSI Sentinel-2.

AB To identify the effect of nitrogen (N) nutrition on the dynamic photosynthesis of rice plants, a pot experiment was conducted under two N conditions. The leaf N and chlorophyll levels, as well as steady-state photosynthesis, were significantly increased under high N. After the transition from saturating to low light levels, decreases in the induction state (IS%) of leaf photosynthesis (A) and stomatal conductance (g(s)) were more severe under low than under high N supply. After the transition from low to flecked irradiance, the times to 90% of maximum A (T-90%A) were significantly longer under low than under high N supply. Under flecked irradiance, the maximum A under saturating light (A(max-fleck)) and the steady-state A under low light (A(min-fleck)) were both lower than those under uniform irradiance (A(sat) and A(initial)). Under high N supply, A(max-fleck) was 14.12% lower than A(sat), while it was 22.80% lower under low N supply. The higher IS%, shorter T-90%A, and the lower depression of A(max-fleck) from A(sat) under high N supply led to a less carbon loss compared with under a low N supply. Therefore, we concluded that N can improve the rapid response of photosynthesis to changing irradiance.

AB Exploring the link between above- and belowground biodiversity has been a major theme of recent ecological research, due in large part to the increasingly well-recognized role that soil microorganisms play in driving plant community processes. In this study, we utilized a field-based tree experiment in Minnesota, USA, to assess the effect of changes in plant species richness and phylogenetic diversity on the richness and composition of both ectomycorrhizal and saprotrophic fungal communities. We found that ectomycorrhizal fungal species richness was significantly positively influenced by increasing plant phylogenetic diversity, while saprotrophic fungal species richness was significantly affected by plant leaf nitrogen content, specific root length and standing biomass. The increasing ectomycorrhizal fungal richness associated with increasing plant phylogenetic diversity was driven by the combined presence of ectomycorrhizal fungal specialists in plots with both gymnosperm and angiosperm hosts. Although the species composition of both the ectomycorrhizal and saprotrophic fungal communities changed significantly in response to changes in plant species composition, the effect was much greater for ectomycorrhizal fungi. In addition, ectomycorrhizal but not saprotrophic fungal species composition was significantly influenced by both plant phylum (angiosperm, gymnosperm, both) and origin (Europe, America, both). The phylum effect was caused by differences in ectomycorrhizal fungal community composition, while the origin effect was attributable to differences in community heterogeneity. Taken together, this study emphasizes that plant-associated effects on soil fungal communities are largely guild-specific and provides a mechanistic basis for the positive link between plant phylogenetic diversity and ectomycorrhizal fungal richness.

AB Intermittent rivers are naturally dynamic ecosystems in which flow cessation and riverbed drying cause temporal fluctuations in aquatic biodiversity. We analysed datasets from intermittent rivers in different climate zones across the world to examine responses of aquatic macroinvertebrate assemblages to drying, in relation to both taxonomic composition and traits of resistance and resilience. First, we compared the differences in taxonomic richness and turnover and in trait diversity, richness and redundancy before and after intermittent sites dried with the differences in concurrently sampled perennial sites. We found such high levels of variation in the before-after differences at intermittent and perennial sites that we could not detect statistical differences between them. Second, we examined the effects of climate (arid, Mediterranean, temperate) and durations of dry and post-dry (flowing) periods on responses to drying at intermittent sites. Only climate had a detectable effect; the proportion of taxa at intermittent sites that persisted through drying-rewetting phases was greatest in arid-zone rivers. Regardless of climate, the invertebrates that persisted at intermittent sites were dominated by taxa resistant to drying. By contrast, taxa that persisted at perennial sites had fewer traits conferring resistance but more conferring resilience. The contributions of resistance and resilience combined with the presence of both intermittent and perennial reaches likely supports the long-term stability and persistence of communities in intermittent rivers, despite the inherently high variation in short-term responses to drying.

AB In this paper, we investigate how climate, land use, habitat characteristics, and socioeconomic activities contribute to predict the current potential distributions of the "100 among the world's worst invasive alien species". We calculated the predictive power of each of the 41 variables for the 95 species including a large number of plants, vertebrates and invertebrates. We then calibrated the species distribution models with a set of appropriate variables for each invasive alien species to predict the potential distribution of these species and identify the major regions of origin of the invasive alien species. We found that climate variables were primarily predictors of the distribution of the global invaders studied. In addition, the habitat characteristics were also important predictors following by the socioeconomic variables such as the nearest distance to airports, seaports and human population density. We show that the potential areas at the highest risk of invasions from these species are located in Western Europe, Eastern United States, Central America, the eastern coast of Australia, and some Indonesian islands. We argue that these potential hotspots of invasions should be monitored in priority to prevent new invasions from these species. This study provides evidence of the importance of considering both habitat characteristics, socioeconomic and climate change factors for the current and future predictions of biological invasions.

AB Ecological data sets rarely extend back more than a few decades, limiting our understanding of environmental change and its drivers. Marine historical ecology has played a critical role in filling these data gaps by illuminating the magnitude and rate of ongoing changes in marine ecosystems. Yet despite a growing body of knowledge, historical insights are rarely explicitly incorporated in mainstream conservation and management efforts. Failing to consider historical change can have major implications for conservation, such as the ratcheting down of expectations of ecosystem quality over time, leading to less ambitious targets for recovery or restoration. We discuss several unconventional sources used by historical ecologists to fill data gaps including menus, newspaper articles, cookbooks, museum collections, artwork, benthic sediment cores and novel techniques for their analysis. We specify opportunities for the integration of historical data into conservation and management, and highlight the important role that these data can play in filling conservation data gaps and motivating conservation actions. As historical marine ecology research continues to grow as a multidisciplinary enterprise, great opportunities remain to foster direct linkages to conservation and improve the outlook for marine ecosystems.

AB Landscape ecological risk assessment can effectively identify key elements for landscape sustainability, which directly improves human wellbeing. However, previous research has tended to apply risk probability, measured by overlaying landscape metrics to evaluate risk, generally lacking a quantitative assessment of loss and uncertainty of risk. This study, taking Liaoyuan City as a case area, explores landscape ecological risk assessment associated with mining cities, based on probability of risk and potential ecological loss. The assessment results show landscape ecological risk is lower in highly urbanized areas than those rural areas, suggesting that not only cities but also natural and semi-natural areas contribute to overall landscape-scale ecological risk. Our comparison of potential ecological risk in 58 watersheds in the region shows that ecological loss are moderate or high in the 10 high-risk watersheds. The 35 moderate-risk watersheds contain a large proportion of farmland, and the 13 low-risk watersheds are mainly distributed in flat terrain areas. Our uncertainty analyses result in a close range between simulated and calculated values, suggesting that our model is generally applicable. Our analysis has good potential in the fields of resource development, landscape planning and ecological restoration, and provides a quantitative method for achieving landscape sustainability in a mining city.

AB Operational use of the ecosystem service (ES) concept in conservation and planning requires quantitative assessments based on accurate mapping of ESs. Our goal is to review spatial assessments of ESs, with an emphasis on the socioecological drivers of ESs, the spatial datasets commonly used to represent those drivers, and the methodological approaches used to spatially model ESs. We conclude that diverse strategies, integrating both spatial and aspatial data, have been used to map ES supply and human demand. Model parameters representing abiotic ecosystem properties can be supported by use of well-developed and widely available spatial datasets. Land-cover data, often manipulated or subject to modeling in a GIS, is the most common input for ES modeling; however, assessments are increasingly informed by a mechanistic understanding of the relationships between drivers and services. We suggest that ES assessments are potentially weakened by the simplifying assumptions often needed to translate between conceptual models and widely used spatial data. Adoption of quantitative spatial data that more directly represent ecosystem properties may improve parameterization of mechanistic ES models and increase confidence in ES assessments.

AB Better integration of knowledge from ecological, social and economic science is necessary to advance the understanding and modelling of socio-ecological systems. To model ecosystem integrity (El) and ecosystem services (ES) at the landscape scale, assessment matrices are commonly used. These matrices assign capacities to provide different services to different land cover types. We revised such an existing matrix and examined the regional heterogeneity in El and ES provision in Europe and searched for spatial gradients in their provision to elucidate their suitability for large-scale El and ES mapping in Europe. Overall, 28 sites belonging to the Long-Term Ecological Research network in Europe participated in this study, covering a longitudinal gradient from Spain to Bulgaria and a latitudinal gradient from Italy to Sweden. As a primary outcome, an improved and consolidated El and ES matrix was achieved with 17.5% of all matrix fields updated. For the first time, this new matrix also contains measures of uncertainty for each entry. El and ES provision assessments were more variable for natural and semi-natural than for more anthropogenically dominated land cover classes. Among the main types of El and ES, cultural service provision was rated most heterogeneously in Europe, while abiotic provisioning services were more constant. Longitudinal and latitudinal El and ES gradients were mostly detected in natural and semi-natural land cover types where temperature and precipitation are major drivers. In anthropogenically determined systems in which cultural services play a dominant role, temperature and precipitation gradients were less important. Our results suggest that this matrix approach to assess El and ES provision principally works on broad spatial scales; however, local assessments for natural systems seem to be less generalizable than assessments from anthropogenically determined systems. Provisioning and regulating services are more generalizable than cultural services. Particularly in natural and semi-natural systems, spatial gradients need to be considered. We discuss uncertainties associated with this matrix-based El and ES assessment approach and suggest that future large-scale studies should include additional land cover information and ecosystem disservices and may determine ES fluxes by differentiating between ES provision and consumption.

AB Identifying the environmental conditions that drive biogeographic structure remains a major challenge of biogeography, evolutionary ecology and increasingly, conservation biology. Here, we use multivariate classification trees to assess the biogeographic structure of northeast Pacific (approximate to 26-58 degrees N) rocky intertidal species (406 species of algae and invertebrates) from 102 field sites. Random forest analyses are used to assess the importance of 29 environmental variables, encompassing a broad range of potential drivers, to predict biogeographic structure. Analyses are repeated for species with different larval dispersal capabilities and by broad taxonomic categories (invertebrates and algae). Results show that overall biogeographic structure is in general agreement with classic classification schemes, but patterns are variable among species with different larval dispersal capabilities. Random forest models show a very high fit (pseudo r(2) > 0.94) and indicate that biogeographic structure can be predicted by a relatively modest subset of variables. Upwelling related variables are the best overall predictors of biogeographic structure (nutrient concentrations, sea-surface temperature, upwelling/downwelling seasonal switch index), but the relative importance of predictors is geographically variable and top predictors are dependent on the type of larval dispersal. Upwelling related variables are more important to predict biogeographic structure for invertebrates with lower-medium dispersal capabilities and algae, whereas species with high larval dispersal (planktotrophic) are better predicted by a different subset of variables (i.e. salinity, precipitation seasonality). Our results lend support to the influence of coastal upwelling in structuring biogeographic patterns and highlight the potential for climate change-induced alterations of upwelling regimes to profoundly affect biodiversity at biogeographic scales.

AB Spatial ecosystem models, such as OSMOSE, have become integral tools in achieving ecosystem-based management for their ability to thoroughly describe predator-prey dynamics in a spatially explicit context. Distribution maps, which define the initial spatial allocation of functional groups abundance, can have a large effect on the predator-prey dynamics that spatially explicit ecosystem models simulate. Here, we introduce the delta GAM approach we developed to be able to produce distribution maps for an OSMOSE model of the West Florida Shelf (Gulf of Mexico), OSMOSE-WFS. This delta GAM approach predicts the spatial distribution of different life stages of the multiple functional groups represented in OSMOSE-WFS (life-stage groups') at different seasons, over the entire Gulf of Mexico (GOM) shelf including areas where abundance estimates do not exist, using different research survey datasets and regional environmental and habitat features. Our delta GAM approach consists of fitting two independent models, a binomial GAM and a quasi-Poisson GAM, whose predictions are then combined using the delta method to yield spatial abundance estimates. To validate delta GAMs, bootstraps are used and Spearman's correlation coefficients (Spearman's p's) between predicted and observed abundance values are estimated and tested to be significantly different from zero. We use pink shrimp (Farfantepenaeus duorarum) to demonstrate our delta GAM approach by predicting the summer distribution of this species over the GOM shelf and the West Florida Shelf. Predictions of the delta GAM reflect existing empirical research related to pink shrimp habitat preferences and predictions of a negative binomial GAM previously designed for the GOM. We find that using a delta rather than a negative binomial GAM saves significant computation time at the expense of a slight reduction in GAM performance. A positive and highly significant Spearman's p between observed and predicted abundance values indicates that our delta GAM can reliably be used to predict pink shrimp spatial distribution. Spearman's p was also positive and highly significant in every life-stage group represented in OSMOSE-WFS and season, though often low. Therefore, delta GAMs fitted for the different life-stage groups and seasons correctly predict qualitative differences between low- and high-abundance areas and are deemed appropriate for generating distribution maps for OSMOSE-WFS. The delta GAM approach we developed is a simple, convenient method to create distribution maps to be fed into spatially explicit ecosystem models, where wide spatial and taxonomic coverage is desired while benefits of high precision estimates are lost at run-time.

AB Predicting habitat suitability under climate change is vital to conserving biodiversity. However, current species distribution models rely on coarse scale climate data, whereas fine scale microclimate data may be necessary to assess habitat suitability and generate predictive models. Here, we evaluate disparities between temperature data at the coarse scale from weather stations versus fine-scale data measured in microhabitats required for a climate-sensitive mammal, the American pika (Ochotona princeps). We collected two years of temperature data in occupied talus habitats predicted to be suitable (high elevation) and unsuitable (low elevation) by the bioclimatic envelope approach. At low elevations, talus surface and interstitial microclimates drastically differed from ambient temperatures measured on-site and at a nearby weather station. Interstitial talus temperatures were frequently decoupled from high ambient temperatures, resulting in instantaneous disparities of over 30 degrees C between these two measurements. Microhabitat temperatures were also highly heterogeneous, such that temperature measurements within the same patch of talus were not more correlated than measurements at distant patches. An experimental manipulation revealed that vegetation cover may cool the talus surface by up to 10 degrees C during the summer, which may contribute to this spatial heterogeneity. Finally, low elevation microclimates were milder and less variable than typical alpine habitat, suggesting that, counter to species distribution model predictions, these seemingly unsuitable habitats may actually be better refugia for this species under climate change. These results highlight the importance of fine-scale microhabitat data in habitat assessments and underscore the notion that some critical refugia may be counterintuitive.

AB Understanding space use of free-living endangered animals is key to informing management decisions for conservation planning. Like most scavengers, vultures have evolved under a context of unpredictability of food resources (i.e., exploiting scattered carcasses that are intermittently available). However, the role of predictable sources of food in shaping spatial ecology of vultures has seldom been studied in detail. Here, we quantify the home range of the Egyptian Vulture (Neophron percnopterus), a long-lived raptor that has experienced severe population decline throughout its range and is qualified as endangered worldwide. To this end, six adults were tracked by satellite telemetry in Spain during the breeding season, from 2007 to 2012, recording 10 360 GPS locations. Using Resource Utilization Functions, we assessed the topology of the Utilization Distribution, a three-dimensional measure that shows the probability of finding an animal within the home range. Our results showed how food availability, and principally, how food predictability, determines ranging behavior of this species. Egyptian Vultures showed consistent site fidelity across years, measured as the two-and three-dimensional overlap in their home ranges. Space use varied considerably within the home range and remarkably, places located far from nesting sites were used more frequently than some areas located closer. Therefore, traditional conservation measures based on establishing restrictive rules within a fixed radius around nesting sites could be biologically meaningless if other areas within the home range are not protected too. Finally, our results emphasize the importance of anthropogenic predictable sources of food (mainly vulture restaurants) in shaping the space use of scavengers, which is in agreement with recent findings. Hence, measures aimed at ensuring food availability are essential to preserve this endangered vulture, especially in the present context of limiting carrion dumping in the field due to sanitary regulations according to European legislation.

AB Previous genetic studies have demonstrated that natal homing shapes the stock structure of marine turtle nesting populations. However, widespread sharing of common haplotypes based on short segments of the mitochondrial control region often limits resolution of the demographic connectivity of populations. Recent studies employing longer control region sequences to resolve haplotype sharing have focused on regional assessments of genetic structure and phylogeography. Here we synthesize available control region sequences for loggerhead turtles from the Mediterranean Sea, Atlantic, and western Indian Ocean basins. These data represent six of the nine globally significant regional management units (RMUs) for the species and include novel sequence data from Brazil, Cape Verde, South Africa and Oman. Genetic tests of differentiation among 42 rookeries represented by short sequences (380 bp haplotypes from 3,486 samples) and 40 rookeries represented by long sequences (similar to 800 bp haplotypes from 3,434 samples) supported the distinction of the six RMUs analyzed as well as recognition of at least 18 demographically independent management units (MUs) with respect to female natal homing. A total of 59 haplotypes were resolved. These haplotypes belonged to two highly divergent global lineages, with haplogroup I represented primarily by CC-A1, CC-A4, and CC-A11 variants and haplogroup II represented by CC-A2 and derived variants. Geographic distribution patterns of haplogroup II haplotypes and the nested position of CC-A11.6 from Oman among the Atlantic haplotypes invoke recent colonization of the Indian Ocean from the Atlantic for both global lineages. The haplotypes we confirmed for western Indian Ocean RMUs allow reinterpretation of previous mixed stock analysis and further suggest that contemporary migratory connectivity between the Indian and Atlantic Oceans occurs on a broader scale than previously hypothesized. This study represents a valuable model for conducting comprehensive international cooperative data management and research in marine ecology.

AB Environmental drivers of seaweed biomass were investigated at Ningaloo, Western Australia, a coral reef ecosystem with negligible anthropogenic influences on seaweeds from fishing, farming, or eutrophication. Periodic surveys of benthic macroalgae occupying seaweed-dominated beds within the lagoon at two locations (Coral Bay, Tantabiddi) were made during winter, spring, and late summer over a 26 month period. Canopy-forming Sargassum spp. biomass fluctuated over a seasonal growth-decay cycle, with highest values in the warm summer months (up to 1013 g fresh weight 0.25 m(-2) at Coral Bay) and lowest values in winter (down to 155 g fresh weight 0.25 m(-2) at Tantabiddi). Conversely, prominent understory seaweed genera Dictyopteris and Lobophora reached peak biomass in winter, when the Sargassum spp. canopy was lowest. Sargassum spp. biomass variation could be attributed largely to time (52%), location (21%), and site (26%), with low variation within individual seaweed beds (1%). Statistical analysis of the influence of five environmental variables (temperature, light, wind-driven upwelling, rainfall, significant wave height) indicated that location and sea temperature (1 month antecedent to biomass) provided the best explanation for Sargassum spp. biomass fluctuations. While sea temperature is a key driver of seaweed temporal dynamics, heterogeneity at the kilometer scale suggests that spatial context is also important. Given the important role of seaweeds in many ecosystem processes, this strong biophysical coupling between Sargassum spp. biomass and sea temperature suggests that thermal climate change will significantly affect coral reef productivity and biodiversity.

AB In 2006 the United Nations called on states to implement measures to prevent significant adverse impacts to vulnerable marine ecosystems (VMEs) in the deep sea It has been widely recognised that a major limitation to the effective application of these measures to date is uncertainty regarding the distribution of VMEs. Conservationists, researchers, resource managers and governmental bodies are increasingly turning to predictive species distribution models (SDMs) to identify the potential presence of species in areas that have not been sampled. In particular, the development of robust 'presence-background' model algorithms has accelerated the application of these techniques for working with presence-only species data. This has allowed scientists to exploit the large amounts of species data held in global biogeographic databases. Despite improvements in model algorithms, environmental data and species presences, there are still limitations to the reliability of these techniques, especially in poorly studied areas such as the deep sea Recent studies have begun to address a key limitation, the quality of data, by using multibeam echosounder surveys and species data from video surveys to acquire high-resolution data Whilst these data are often amongst the very best that can be acquired, the surveys are highly localised, often targeted towards known VME-containing areas, are very expensive and time consuming. It is financially prohibitive to survey whole regions or ocean basins using these techniques, so alternative cost-effective approaches are required. Here, we review 'presence-background' SDMs in the context of those studies conducted in the deep sea The issues of sampling bias, spatial autocorrelation, spatial scale, model evaluation and validation are considered in detail, and reference is made to recent developments in species distribution modelling literature. Further information is provided on how these approaches are being used to influence ocean management, and best practises are outlined to aid the effective adoption of these techniques in the future.

AB Boreal larch forests in eastern Siberia contain about half of the carbon accumulated in Eurasian forest communities, and fire is an important disturbance in this area, contributing to changes in forest composition and breaking the original succession trajectory. Assessing burn severity and environmental controls on post-fire larch recruitment is critical for understanding long-term effects of fire disturbance on forest succession in this region. A mega-fire that burned 8700 ha in the year 2000 in the Great Xing' an Mountains provided an opportunity to study the effects of mixed-severity fire disturbance in larch forests. We sampled tree recruitment in 83 burned sites to address the question of how burn severity and site environment interact to influence the species composition and density of post-fire tree recruitment, and hence the successional trajectory of forest. We explored the hypothesis that the larch forest was more likely to replace itself rapidly ("self-replacement succession") in areas of low-severity burn, but was more likely to be replaced by an early-seral community of broadleaf trees ("relay succession") in areas of high-severity burn. Our analysis showed that post-fire conifer and broadleaf recruit densities were both negatively related to burn severity and understory cover. Environmental conditions (e.g. elevation, slope, aspect) had weaker influences than burn severity on post-fire tree densities, but played a stronger role in determining the relative proportion of conifer recruits. Broadleaf trees recruited abundantly in low-severity burns in upland areas, even though they were absent from most of the pre-fire sites. In contrast, coniferous trees recruited more abundantly in low-severity burns in valley bottom areas. The comparison of pre- and post-fire tree composition in the burned patches indicated that self-replacement succession was likely to occur in valley bottom areas that burned with low severity. Burned upland areas are more likely to experience an alternative, broadleaf-dominated trajectory of relay succession. The increase in the severity and frequency of fires due to climate warming may prompt shifts from a larch dominated forest to an increasingly birch dominated landscape, substantially altering landscape dynamics and ecosystem services.

AB The complex nature of marine and coastal ecosystems combined with the inaccessibility and invisibility of the majority of their goods and services call for tailored approaches to valuation. Furthermore, a deliberative approach is necessary to support emerging policy initiatives and decision-making processes, and this paper presents a participatory framework for valuing marine and coastal ecosystem services. The framework provides a coherent process for the identification and valuation of these services through the active involvement of stakeholder groups. The process begins with "set the scene", a stage in which institutional analysis and procedures for stakeholder involvement are deployed. A value elicitation stage, "deepen understanding", follows to determine the impacts of policy and/or project proposals. This stage involves the identification of the affected ecosystem services, the variations on the flow of services and the associated ecological, social and economic values. The final stage of "articulate values" fosters the integration of knowledge into policy and decision-making processes. The proposed framework adds communicative and informative features to valuation by advancing an approach that integrates deliberative methods for articulating the multiple values of ecosystem services affected by marine and coastal management decisions.

AB Use of genetic methods to estimate effective population size (N-e) is rapidly increasing, but all approaches make simplifying assumptions unlikely to be met in real populations. In particular, all assume a single, unstructured population, and none has been evaluated for use with continuously distributed species. We simulated continuous populations with local mating structure, as envisioned by Wright's concept of neighborhood size (NS), and evaluated performance of a single-sample estimator based on linkage disequilibrium (LD), which provides an estimate of the effective number of parents that produced the sample (N-b). Results illustrate the interacting effects of two phenomena, drift and mixture, that contribute to LD. Samples from areas equal to or smaller than a breeding window produced estimates close to the NS. As the sampling window increased in size to encompass multiple genetic neighborhoods, mixture LD from a two-locus Wahlund effect overwhelmed the reduction in drift LD from incorporating offspring from more parents. As a consequence, (N) over cap (b) never approached the global N-e, even when the geographic scale of sampling was large. Results indicate that caution is needed in applying standard methods for estimating effective size to continuously distributed populations.

AB During leaf senescence, Rubisco is gradually degraded and its components are recycled within the plant. Although Rubisco can be mobilized to the vacuole by autophagy via specific autophagic bodies, the importance of this process in Rubisco degradation has not been shown directly. Here, we monitored Rubisco autophagy during leaf senescence by fusing synthetic green fluorescent protein (sGFP) or monomeric red fluorescent protein (mRFP) with Rubisco in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). When attached leaves were individually exposed to darkness to promote their senescence, the fluorescence of Rubisco-sGFP was observed in the vacuolar lumen as well as chloroplasts. In addition, release of free-sGFP due to the processing of Rubisco-sGFP was observed in the vacuole of individually darkened leaves. This vacuolar transfer and processing of Rubisco-sGFP was not observed in autophagy-deficient atg5 mutants. Unlike sGFP, mRFP was resistant to proteolysis in the leaf vacuole of light-grown plants. The vacuolar transfer and processing of Rubisco-mRFP was observed at an early stage of natural leaf senescence and was also obvious in leaves naturally covered by other leaves. These results indicate that autophagy contributes substantially to Rubisco degradation during natural leaf senescence as well as dark-promoted senescence.

AB The quantification of forest above-ground biomass (AGB) is important for such broader applications as decision making, forest management, carbon (C) stock change assessment and scientific applications, such as C cycle modeling. However, there is a great uncertainty related to the estimation of forest AGB, especially in the tropics. The main goal of this study was to test a combination of field data and Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) Phased Array L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) backscatter intensity data to reduce the uncertainty in the estimation of forest AGB in the Miombo savanna woodlands of Mozambique (East Africa). A machine learning algorithm, based on bagging stochastic gradient boosting (BagSGB), was used to model forest AGB as a function of ALOS PALSAR Fine Beam Dual (FBD) backscatter intensity metrics. The application of this method resulted in a coefficient of correlation (R) between observed and predicted (10-fold cross-validation) forest AGB values of 0.95 and a root mean square error of 5.03 Mg.ha(-1). However, as a consequence of using bootstrap samples in combination with a cross validation procedure, some bias may have been introduced, and the reported cross validation statistics could be overoptimistic. Therefore and as a consequence of the BagSGB model, a measure of prediction variability (coefficient of variation) on a pixel-by-pixel basis was also produced, with values ranging from 10 to 119% (mean = 25%) across the study area. It provides additional and complementary information regarding the spatial distribution of the error resulting from the application of the fitted model to new observations.

AB Loss of natural river network connectivity is presumed to be one of the more generalized and important human-induced alterations in natural environments and is frequently perceived as one of the main causes of the decline of freshwater fish species.
   The purpose of the present study was to ascertain the impact of barriers on the distribution of freshwater fish species with distinct life histories. In this study 196 sites in three river basins in Western Iberia were sampled and analyzed for the presence of barriers. Three alternative analytical approaches based on Generalized Linear Models (GLM) were used to test the contribution of connectivity-related variables to species distribution: (1) explore whether connectivity-related variables are included in the best-fitting distribution models; (2) use models calibrated at non-disturbed sites to compute deviations from model predictions made at sites with connectivity-related disturbances; and (3) use a hierarchical partitioning approach, in which the improvement of model fit due to the inclusion of connectivity as a predictor variable is assessed using all possible variable combinations.
   The results indicate a general lack of influence of barriers on freshwater fish species distributions. The effects of environment and human pressures exceeded the isolated effect of connectivity losses. Further studies based on experimental designs that are more specifically directed at this specific issue are needed in order to fully understand the effects of barriers on species and communities. A more thorough assessment of the effects of connectivity on fish is crucial to the implementation of adequate restoration actions that are in turn needed to achieve the goals of the European Water Framework Directive.

AB Trait-based approaches have long been a feature of physiology and of ecology. While the latter fields drifted apart in the twentieth century, they are converging owing at least partly to growing similarities in their trait-based approaches, which have much to offer conservation biology. The convergence of spatially explicit approaches to understanding trait variation and its ecological implications, such as encapsulated in community assembly and macrophysiology, provides a significant illustration of the similarity of these areas. Both adopt trait-based informatics approaches which are not only providing fundamental biological insights, but are also delivering new information on how environmental change is affecting diversity and how such change may perhaps be mitigated. Such trait-based conservation physiology is illustrated here for each of the major environmental change drivers, specifically: the consequences of overexploitation for body size and physiological variation; the impacts of vegetation change on thermal safety margins; the consequences of changing net primary productivity and human use thereof for physiological variation and ecosystem functioning; the impacts of rising temperatures on water loss in ectotherms; how hemisphere-related variation in traits may affect responses to changing rainfall regimes and pollution; and how trait-based approaches may enable interactions between climate change and biological invasions to be elucidated.

AB Specialisms on resources and for niches, leading to specialization, have been construed to be tantamount to speciation and vice versa, while the occurrence of true generalism in nature has also been questioned. We argue that generalism in resource use, biotope occupancy, and niche breadth not only exists, but also forms a crucial part in the evolution of specialists, representing a vital force in speciation and a more effective insurance against extinction. We model the part played by generalism and specialism in speciation and illustrate how a balance may be maintained between the number of specialists and generalists within taxa. The balance occurs as an ongoing cycle arising from turnover in the production of specialists and generalists, speciation, and species extinction. The nature of the balance depends on the type of resources exploited, biotopes, and niche space occupied. These vary between different regions and create taxonomic biases towards generalists or specialists. We envisage that the process may be sympatric/parapatric, although it is more likely initiated by allopatry driven by abiotic forces.

AB Introduced lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) threaten to extirpate native Yellowstone cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchits clarkii bouvieri) in the 34 000 ha Yellowstone Lake in Yellowstone National Park, USA. Suppression (and eventual eradication) of the lake trout population is deemed necessary for the conservation of Yellowstone cutthroat trout. A US National Park Service gill-netting program removed nearly 450 000 lake trout from Yellowstone Lake from 1995 through 2009. We examined temporal variation in individual growth, body condition, length and age at maturity, fecundity, mortality, and population models to assess the efficacy of the lake trout suppression program. Population metrics did not indicate overharvest despite more than a decade of fish removal. The current rate of population growth is positive; however, it is lower than it would be in the absence of lake trout suppression. Fishing effort needs to increase above observed levels to reduce population growth rate below replacement. Additionally, high sensitivity of population growth rate to reproductive vital rates indicates that increasing fishing mortality for sexually mature lake trout may increase the effectiveness of suppression. Lake trout suppression in Yellowstone Lake illustrates the complexities of trying to remove an apex predator to restore a relatively large remote lentic ecosystem with a simple fish assemblage.

AB Satellite remote sensing has the potential to contribute to plant phenology monitoring at spatial and temporal scales relevant for regional and global scale studies. Historically, temporal composites of satellite data, ranging from 8 days to 16 days, have been used as a starting point for satellite-derived phenology data sets. In this study we assess how the temporal resolution of such composites affects the estimation of the start of season (SOS) by: 1) calibrating a relationship between satellite derived SOS with in situ leaf unfolding (LU) of trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides) across Canada and 2) quantifying the sensitivity of calibrated satellite SOS estimates and trends, over Canadian broadleaf forests, to the temporal resolution of NDVI data. SOS estimates and trends derived from daily NDVI data were compared to SOS estimates and trends derived from multiday NDVI composites that retain the exact date of the maximum NDVI value or that assume the midpoint of the multiday interval as the observation date. In situ observations of LU dates were acquired from the PlantWatch Canada network. A new Canadian database of cloud and snow screened daily 1-km resolution National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration advanced very high resolution radiometer surface reflectance images was used as input satellite data. The mean absolute errors of SOS dates with respect to in situ LU dates ranged between 13 and 40 days. SOS estimates from NDVI composites that retain the exact date of the maximum NDVI value had smaller errors (similar to 13 to 20 days). The sensitivity analysis reinforced these findings: SOS estimates from NDVI composites that use the exact date had smaller absolute deviations from the LU date (0 to 5 days) than the SOS estimates from NDVI composites that use the midpoint (-2 to -27 days). The SOS trends between 1985 and 2007 were not sensitive to the temporal resolution or compositing methods. However, SOS trends at individual ecozones showed significant differences with the SOS trends from daily NDVI data (Taiga plains and the Pacific maritime zones). Overall, our results suggest that satellite based estimates of vegetation green-up dates should preferably use sub-sampled NDVI composites that include the exact observation date of the maximum NDVI to minimize errors in both. SOS estimates and SOS trend analyses. For trend analyses alone, any of the compositing methods could be used, preferably with composite intervals of less than 28 days. This is an important finding, as it suggests that existing long-term 10-day or 15-day NDVI composites could be used for SOS trend analyses over broadleaf forests in Canada or similar areas. Future studies will take advantage of the growing in situ phenology networks to improve the validation of satellite derived green-up dates. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The American pika (Ochotona princeps) inhabits talus slopes on isolated mountaintops in the Great Basin, where the species is susceptible to localized extirpations. Previous studies from the region related pika extirpations to proxies for climate and habitat quality, or to relatively short datasets on microclimate. This study extends previous research by modeling extirpation using new data from microclimates and microhabitats, and by including data on the vegetation available to individual pikas. We re-surveyed 25 sites historically occupied by pikas, and collected microclimatic and vegetative-cover data from each site. Sites of pika extirpation experienced higher summer temperatures and higher frequency of extremely warm days during 2005-2007 than did sites of pika persistence. Several aspects of vegetative cover also differed between persistence and extirpation sites, and relative forb cover was positively related to pika persistence. Evaluation of competing models within an information-theoretic framework suggests strong support for recent mean summer temperature as the primary driver of extirpations in this dataset. In agreement with other modeling efforts, this result supports the hypothesis that extirpation results from chronic heat stress during the summer months when pikas must gather and store food for the winter. In contrast with previous studies, we found less support for the hypothesis that extirpation results from acute cold stress during the winter months, possibly due to several differences in analytical methods.

AB The cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) has been described as a species with low levels of genetic variation. This has been suggested to be the consequence of a demographic bottleneck 10 000-12 000 years ago (ya) and also led to the assumption that only small genetic differences exist between the described subspecies. However, analysing mitochondrial DNA and microsatellites in cheetah samples from most of the historic range of the species we found relatively deep phylogeographic breaks between some of the investigated populations, and most of the methods assessed divergence time estimates predating the postulated bottleneck. Mitochondrial DNA monophyly and overall levels of genetic differentiation support the distinctiveness of Northern-East African cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus soemmeringii). Moreover, combining archaeozoological and contemporary samples, we show that Asiatic cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus venaticus) are unambiguously separated from African subspecies. Divergence time estimates from mitochondrial and nuclear data place the split between Asiatic and Southern African cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus jubatus) at 32 000-67 000 ya using an average mammalian microsatellite mutation rate and at 4700-44 000 ya employing human microsatellite mutation rates. Cheetahs are vulnerable to extinction globally and critically endangered in their Asiatic range, where the last 70-110 individuals survive only in Iran. We demonstrate that these extant Iranian cheetahs are an autochthonous monophyletic population and the last representatives of the Asiatic subspecies A. j. venaticus. We advocate that conservation strategies should consider the uncovered independent evolutionary histories of Asiatic and African cheetahs, as well as among some African subspecies. This would facilitate the dual conservation priorities of maintaining locally adapted ecotypes and genetic diversity.

AB In order to understand the effects of projected global warming on soils in different land-use types, we compared the impacts of warming on soils in two contrasting forest ecosystems (a dragon spruce plantation and a natural forest) using the open-top chamber (OTC) method in the Eastern Tibetan Plateau of China. The OTC on average enhanced daily mean soil temperatures by 0.61 degrees C (plantation) and by 0.55 degrees C (natural forest) throughout the growing season, respectively. Conversely, soil volumetric moisture declined by 4.10% in the plantation and by 2.55% in the natural forest, respectively. Warming did not affect dissolved organic C (DOC) and N (DON) in the plantation but significantly increased them in the natural forest. Elevated temperature significantly increased net N mineralization rates and extractable inorganic N pools in both sites. Warming had no effects on microbial biomass C (MBC) and N (MBN) and their ratios (MBC/MBN) in the plantation and significantly increased MBC and MBN only late in the growing season in the natural forest. Warming did not affect basal respiration in the plantation but significantly increased it in the natural forest. No clear change was observed in metabolic quotient between warming regimes for both forest types. Experimental warming tended to increase invertase and urease in both forest soils. Measured pools related to N turnover generally showed significant interactions in warming, forest type and sampling date. Taken together, our results indicate that responses of soils to experimental warming depend strongly on forest managements and seasons. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Expert opinion was canvassed to identify crucial knowledge gaps in current understanding of climate change impacts on coral reef fishes. Scientists that had published three or more papers on the effects of climate and environmental factors on reef fishes were invited to submit five questions that, if addressed, would improve our understanding of climate change effects on coral reef fishes. Thirty-three scientists provided 155 questions, and 32 scientists scored these questions in terms of: (i) identifying a knowledge gap, (ii) achievability, (iii) applicability to a broad spectrum of species and reef habitats, and (iv) priority. Forty-two per cent of the questions related to habitat associations and community dynamics of fish, reflecting the established effects and immediate concern relating to climate-induced coral loss and habitat degradation. However, there were also questions on fish demographics, physiology, behaviour and management, all of which could be potentially affected by climate change. Irrespective of their individual expertise and background, scientists scored questions from different topics similarly, suggesting limited bias and recognition of a need for greater interdisciplinary and collaborative research. Presented here are the 53 highest-scoring unique questions. These questions should act as a guide for future research, providing a basis for better assessment and management of climate change impacts on coral reefs and associated fish communities.

AB Background: Carassius auratus is a primary freshwater fish with bisexual diploid and unisexual gynogenetic triploid lineages. It is distributed widely in Eurasia and is especially common in East Asia. Although several genetic studies have been conducted on C. auratus, they have not provided clear phylogenetic and evolutionary descriptions of this fish, probably due to selection bias in sampling sites and the DNA regions analysed. As the first step in clarifying the evolutionary entity of the world's Carassius fishes, we attempted to clarify the phylogeny of C. auratus populations distributed in East Asia.
   Results: We conducted a detailed analysis of a large dataset of mitochondrial gene sequences [CR, 323 bp, 672 sequences (528 sequenced + 144 downloaded); CR + ND4 + ND5 + cyt b, 4669 bp in total, 53 sequences] obtained from C. auratus in East Asia. Our phylogeographic analysis revealed two superlineages, one distributed mainly among the Japanese main islands and the other in various regions in and around the Eurasian continent, including the Ryukyus and Taiwan. The two superlineages include seven lineages with high regional specificity that are composed of endemic populations indigenous to each region. The divergence time of the seven lineages was estimated to be 0.2 million years ago (Mya) by a fossil-based method and 1.0-1.9 Mya by the molecular clock method. The antiquity and endemism of these lineages suggest that they are native to their respective regions, although some seem to have been affected by the artificial introduction of C. auratus belonging to other lineages. Triploids of C. auratus did not form a monophyletic lineage but were clustered mostly with sympatric diploids.
   Conclusions: The results of the present study revealed the existence of two superlineages of C. auratus in East Asia that include seven lineages endemic to each of the seven regions examined. The lack of substantial genetic separation between triploids and diploids indicates that triploids are not composed of a single independent lineage. The ancient origins and evolutionary uniqueness of the seven lineages warrant their conservation. An overall phylogenetic framework obtained from the present study will be of use for estimating the phylogenetic relationships of Carassius fishes on the Eurasian continent.

AB Despite the importance of understanding the mechanisms underlying range limits and abundance structure, few studies have sought to do so. Here we use a terrestrial slug species, Deroceras panormitanum, that has invaded a remote, largely predator-free, Southern Ocean island as a model system to do so. Across Marion Island, slug density does not conform to an abundant centre distribution. Rather, abundance structure is characterized by patches and gaps. These are associated with this desiccation-sensitive species' preference for biotic and drainage line habitats that share few characteristics except for their high humidity below the vegetation surface. The coastal range margin has a threshold form, rapidly rising from zero to high density. Slugs do not occur where soil-exchangeable Na values are higher than 3000 mg kg(-1), and in laboratory experiments, survival is high below this value but negligible above it. Upper elevation range margins are a function of the inability of this species to survive temperatures below an absolute limit of -6.4 degrees C, which is regularly exceeded at 200 m altitude, above which slug density declines to zero. However, the linear decline in density from the coastal peak is probably also a function of a decline in performance or time available for activity. This is probably associated with an altitudinal decline in mean annual soil temperature. These findings support previous predictions made regarding the form of density change when substrate or climatic factors set range limits.

AB Climate change will increase the recurrence of extreme weather events such as drought and heavy rainfall. Evidence suggests that extreme weather events pose threats to ecosystem functioning, particularly to nutrient cycling and biomass production. These ecosystem functions depend strongly on below-ground biotic processes, including the activity and interactions among plants, soil fauna, and micro-organisms. Here, experimental grassland and heath communities of three phytodiversity levels were exposed either to a simulated single drought or to a heavy rainfall event. Both weather manipulations were repeated for two consecutive years. The magnitude of manipulations imitated the local 100-year extreme weather event. Heavy rainfall events increased below-ground plant biomass and stimulated soil enzyme activities as well as decomposition rates for both plant communities. In contrast, extreme drought did not reduce below-ground plant biomass and root length, soil enzyme activities, and cellulose decomposition rate. The low responsiveness of the measured ecosystem properties in face of the applied weather manipulations rendered the detection of significant interactions between weather events and phytodiversity impossible. Our data indicate on the one hand the close interaction between below ground plant parameters and microbial turnover processes in soil; on the other hand it shows that the plant-soil system can buffer against extreme drought events, at last for the period of investigation.

AB Sustainable agricultural practices in conjunction with ecological restoration methods can reduce the detrimental effects of agriculture. The Society for Ecological Restoration International has produced generic guidelines for conceiving, organizing, conducting and assessing ecological restoration projects. Additionally, there are now good conceptual frameworks, guidelines and practical methods for developing ecological restoration programmes that are based on sound ecological principles and supported by empirical evidence and modelling approaches. Restoration methods must also be technically achievable and socially acceptable and spread over a range of locations. It is important to reconcile differences between methods that favour conservation and those that favour economic returns, to ensure that conservation efforts are beneficial for both landowners and biodiversity. One option for this type of mutual benefit is the use of agri-environmental schemes to provide financial incentives to landholders in exchange for providing conservation services and other benefits. However, further work is required to define and measure the effectiveness of agri- environmental schemes. The broader potential for ecological restoration to improve the sustainability of agricultural production while conserving biodiversity in farmscapes and reducing external costs is high, but there is still much to learn, particularly for the most efficient use of agri-environmental schemes to change land use practice.

AB The response of terrestrial mammals and arboreal marsupials to past burning history as well as a year prior to, and then for 4 years after, a major wildfire in 2003 at Booderee National Park, Jervis Bay Territory was quantified. The present study encompassed extensive repeated surveys at a set of 109 replicated sites stratified by vegetation type and fire history. It was found that most species exhibited significant differences in presence and abundance between major vegetation types. Detections of long-nosed bandicoot (Perameles nasuta) increased significantly in all vegetation types surveyed, in both burnt and unburnt areas. Temporal patterns in captures of three species of small mammals (bush rat (Rattus fuscipes), swamp rat (Rattus lutreolus) and brown antechinus (Antechinus stuartii)) showed a trend for lower numbers of captures on burnt sites compared with unburnt sites. Three species of arboreal marsupials, common ringtail possum (Pseudocheirus peregrinus), greater glider (Petauroides volans) and common brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula), were moderately common and all showed marked differences in abundance between vegetation types. Whereas P. peregrinus and P. volans exhibited a temporal decline between 2003 and 2006, T. vulpecula exhibited a general increase from 2003 levels. However, arboreal marsupial responses did not appear to be directly fire related.

AB Drought is a major environmental constraint affecting growth and production of coffee. The effects of water supply on growth, biomass allocation, water relations, and gas exchange in two coffee progenies representing drought-tolerant (Siriema) and drought-sensitive (Catucai) genotypes were compared. They were grown in 12-L pots until 4-months old, when they were submitted to two watering treatments for 60d: plants receiving either 100% transpired water (control plants) or a fraction (about 40%) of the amount of water transpired by control plants (drought-stressed plants). Under control conditions, Siriema grew faster than Catucai. Regardless of the watering regimes and progenies, relative growth rate (RGR) was positively correlated both with net assimilation rate (NAR) and tong-term water-use efficiency (WUE), but not with differences in biomass allocation. Both progenies responded to drought stress through (i) similar decreases in both RGR and NAR with marginal, if any, changes in allocation; (ii) decreases in leaf water potential, which occurred to a greater extent in Catucai than in Siriema, even though they have showed similar abilities to adjust osmotically and elastically; (iii) similar reductions in net photosynthesis due mainly to nonstomatal factors; and (iv) decreases in transpiration rate coupled with increased long-term WUE. However, the Lower transpiration rate and the higher tong-term WUE as found in Siriema relative to Catucai under control conditions persisted under drought conditions. Overall, the major differences between these progenies were largely associated with differences in plant water use, which was likely related to the improved water status of Siriema. The possible implications of selecting coffee genotypes for high WUE are discussed. (C) 2007 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB Little is known about water transfer via mycorrhizal hyphae to plants, despite its potential importance in seedling establishment and plant community development, especially in arid environments. Therefore, this process was investigated in the study reported in this paper in laboratory-based tripartite mesocosms containing the shrub Arctostaphylos viscida (manzanita) and young seedlings of sugar pine (Pinus lambertiana) and Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii). The objectives were to determine whether water could be transported through mycorrhizal symbionts shared by establishing conifers and A. viscida and to compare the results obtained using two tracers: the stable isotope deuterium and the dye lucifer yellow carbohydrazide. Water containing the tracers was added to the central compartment containing single manzanita shrubs. The fungal hyphae were then collected as well as plant roots from coniferous seedlings in the other two compartments to determine whether water was transferred via fungal hyphae. In addition, the length of the hyphae and degree of mycorrhizal colonisation were determined. Internal transcribed spacer restriction fragment length polymorphism (ITS-RFLP) analysis was used to identify the fungal species involved in dye (water) transfer. Results of the stable isotope analysis showed that water is transferred via mycorrhizal hyphae, but isotopically labelled water was only detected in Douglas-fir roots, not in sugar pine roots. In contrast, the fluorescent dye was transported via mycorrhizal hyphae to both Douglas-fir and sugar pine seedlings. Only 1 of 15 fungal morphotypes (identified as Atheliaceae) growing in the mesocosms transferred the dye. Differences were detected in the water transfer patterns indicated by the deuterium and fluorescent dye tracers, suggesting that the two labels are transported by different mechanisms in the same hyphae and/or that different fungal taxa transfer them via different routes to host plants. We conclude that both tracers can provide information on resource transfer between fungi and plants, but we cannot be sure that the dye transfer data provide accurate indications of water transfer rates and patterns. The isotopic tracer provides more direct indications of water movement and is therefore more suitable than the dye for studying water relations of plants and their associated mycorrhizal fungi.

AB Wastelands are likely to host a significant part of urban floristic diversity but have received limited attention because they are not considered interesting green zones. Here, we explore the potential role of wastelands in maintaining urban biodiversity to help define effective urban management plans. We quantified floristic diversity in 98 wasteland sites of Hauts-de-Seine, one of the most densely populated areas in France, and characterized the environmental parameters and spatial distribution of sites to identify some of the factors that influence plant species composition and to explore the impact of urban environment on the floristic interest of wastelands. Their floristic richness represented 58% of the total richness observed in the whole study area. Site richness depended on site area (the largest sites were the richest) and site age, with a maximum in sites of intermediate age (4-13 years). In the largest sites only (> 2,500 m(2)), the floristic distance among sites was positively correlated with geographic distance, which suggests that migration of species among large sites partly controls local floristic composition. In contrast, the environmental distance among sites was not correlated with floristic distance. Finally, we showed that the presence of collective and individual dwellings within 200 m of a wasteland decreased its floristic rarity, whereas the presence of rivers or ponds increased it. We derive several recommendations to optimize the management of wastelands with respect to conservation of urban biodiversity.

AB How do populations of highly mobile species inhabiting open environments become reproductively isolated and evolve into new species? We test the hypothesis that elevated ocean-surface temperatures can facilitate allopatry among pelagic populations and thus promote speciation. Oceanographic modelling has shown that increasing surface temperatures cause localization and reduction of upwelling, leading to fragmentation of feeding areas critical to pelagic species. We test our hypothesis by genetic analyses of populations of two closely related baleen whales, the Antarctic minke whale (Balaenoptera bonaerensis) and common minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) whose current distributions and migration patterns extent are largely determined by areas of consistent upwelling with high primary production. Phylogeographic and population genetic analyses of mitochondrial DNA control-region nucleotide sequences collected from 467 whales sampled in four different ocean basins were employed to infer the evolutionary relationship among populations of B. acutorostrata by rooting an intraspecific phylogeny with a population of B. bonaerensis. Our findings suggest that the two species diverged in the Southern Hemisphere less than 5 million years ago (Ma). This estimate places the speciation event during a period of extended global warming in the Pliocene. We propose that elevated ocean temperatures in the period facilitated allopatric speciation by disrupting the continuous belt of upwelling maintained by the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. Our analyses revealed that the current populations of B. acutorostrata likely diverged after the Pliocene some 1.5 Ma when global temperatures had decreased and presumably coinciding with the re-establishment of the polar-equatorial temperature gradient that ultimately drives upwelling. In most population samples, we detected genetic signatures of exponential population expansions, consistent with the notion of increasing carrying capacity after the Pliocene. Our hypothesis that prolonged periods of global warming facilitate speciation in pelagic marine species that depend on upwelling should be tested by comparative analyses in other pelagic species.

AB We examined long-term variability of the biological traits of benthic macroinvertebrate communities using data collected annually (20-, 7-, and 8-years in duration, respectively) from three study regions in northern California's mediterranean-climate region. We related temporal variability to several climatic and physical variables representing precipitation and hydrologic conditions, and assessed the stability of biological-trait composition using time-lag regression analysis. We also examined the temporal variability of trait diversity metrics and their relationship to taxa richness. Trait modalities exhibited high temporal variability (similar to 20 % of all trait modalities had a CV > 50 %) and biological-trait composition varied along a gradient from dry (extreme drought) to wet (above average) years. Traits conferring resistance or resilience to drying (e.g. desiccation resistance, aerial respiration) were more common in drought years, whereas traits conferring resistance or resilience to floods (e.g. flattened body shape, drift dispersal) were more common in wet years. Furthermore, prolonged drought and the patterns of increasing or decreasing precipitation over time in the study regions resulted in patterns of directional change in biological-trait composition. Although biological traits had high temporal variation within each region, between-region variation was higher than temporal variation in a single region. As found in other studies, trait diversity and richness metrics were relatively invariable over time despite high taxonomic turnover. However, there was considerable regional variation in trait diversity metrics along a gradient of increasing taxonomic diversity. The four functional metrics studied showed high redundancy. Taxa richness was positively correlated with three functional metrics (trait richness and two trait diversity measures), and trait richness and diversity became saturated taxa richness increased (similar to 50 taxa). In communities largely controlled by abiotic factors, such as stream invertebrates in mediterranean-climate, high redundancy may be the result of strong filtering of traits at larger spatial scales.

AB Waterholes within the dryland Cooper Creek, Lake Eyre Basin, Australia, are connected only during floods and are typically isolated for long periods. Spatial changes in the macroinvertebrate assemblages of 15 of these waterholes belonging to four regions were explored and these changes were related to environmental aspects of the waterholes measured at four spatial scales: floodplain, waterhole, within waterhole and sample habitat. To explore temporal patterns, one region was sampled on four occasions differing in time since connection. Spatial patterns were characterised by 'differentiation by distance' whereby samples collected closer to each other in the landscape were more similar in assemblage composition than those collected further apart. Thus, there were significant differences between the assemblages of the four regions. Although there was a correlation between macroinvertebrate spatial patterns and a combination of local habitat, geomorphology and water chemistry attributes, it appears unlikely that these variables were responsible for the faunal differentiation by distance. Temporal variability was larger than spatial variability and temporal assemblage patterns were best explained by the ` connectivity potential' of waterholes, reflecting the position of individual waterholes within the broader channel network and long-term connectivity relationships, rather than the actual time since hydrological connection.

AB Betula maximowicziana is a long-lived pioneer tree species in Japanese cool temperate forests that plays an important role in maintenance of the forest ecosystem and has high economic value. Here we assess the wide-range genetic structure of 23 natural populations of B. maximowicziana using 11 simple sequence repeat (SSR) loci. Genetic diversity within populations was relatively low in all populations (mean H-E, 0.361; mean allelic richness, 2.80; mean rare allelic richness, 1.02). The population differentiation was also relatively low (F-ST, 0.062). Genetic distance-based and Bayesian clustering analysis revealed that the populations examined here could be divided into a southern group and a northern group. Analysis of rare allelic richness and Bayesian clustering revealed evidence for both southern and northern refugia during the last glacial period. Furthermore, a comparison of regional genetic diversity revealed significant clines in allelic richness. In spatial genetic structure evaluation, significant isolation by distance (IBD) was detected among the 23 populations, but not within regions. Moreover, significant population bottlenecks were found in all populations under infinite allele model (IAM) assumptions. These unusual, significant bottlenecks might be because of the processes of postglacial colonization and the species' characters and/or life history as a long-lived pioneer tree species. The wide-range, regional genetic structure found in this study provides an important baseline for conservation and forest management, including the identification of evolutionarily significant units (ESUs) and/or management units (MUs) of B. maximowicziana.

AB Taxonomic relationships within the Old World fruit bat genus, Cynopterus, have been equivocal for the better part of a century. While nomenclature has been revised multiple times on the basis of phenotypic characters, evolutionary relationships among taxa representing the entire geographic range of the genus have not been determined. We used mitochondrial DNA sequence data to infer phylogenetic relationships among the three most broadly distributed members of the genus: C brachyotis, C horsfieldi, and C sphinx, and to assess whether C brachyotis represents a single widespread species, or a complex of distinct lineages. Results clearly indicate that C brachyotis is a complex of lineages. C sphinx and C horsfieldi haplotypes formed monophyletic groups nested within the C brachyotis species complex. We identified six divergent mitochondrial lineages that are currently referred to C brachyotis. Lineages from India, Myanmar, Sulawesi, and the Philippines are geographically well-defined, while in Malaysia two lineages, designated Sunda and Forest, are broadly sympatric and may be ecologically distinct. Demographic analyses of the Sunda and Forest lineages suggest strikingly different population histories, including a recent and rapid range expansion in the Sunda lineage, possibly associated with changes in sea levels during the Pleistocene. The resolution of the taxonomic issues raised in this study awaits combined analysis of morphometric characters and molecular data. However, since both the Indian and Malaysian Forest C brachyotis lineages are apparently ecologically restricted to increasingly fragmented forest habitat, we suggest that reevaluation of the conservation status of populations in these regions should be an immediate goal.

AB 1. The habitat accommodation model for animal succession proposed that animal species enter a succession when changes in the vegetation succession reach a threshold of habitat suitable to that species. As the vegetation succession moves on, the habitat becomes less suited to that species and it is competitively excluded by species better suited to the habitat.
   2. The main species in the mammalian succession following fire for wet heath in eastern Australia are rodents, with Pseudomys gracilicaudatus (eastern chestnut mouse) being followed by Rattus lutreolus (swamp rat) which becomes dominant with increasing time since fire. The abundance of both species has been shown to correlate with vegetation density, but in markedly different ways, and asymmetric interspecific competition has been demonstrated using controlled, replicated removal experiments in the field.
   3. We used this system to examine if vegetation density is causal, manipulating the habitat by clipping to remove 60-70% of the vegetative cover from the 10 m x 10 m area surrounding each of six trapping stations on each grid. There were four experimental plots clipped, each with two abutting grids, one clipped and one unclipped, and a further four control plots each with two abutting grids that remained undisturbed.
   4. We monitored the effects on each species with three censuses in January 1993 (summer) before clipping in early February, and on five further censuses, three in February (late summer) to assess immediate, short-term effects, one in August (winter) and one in December 1993 (early summer).
   5. The abundance of Rattus lutreolus was significantly reduced by clipping the vegetation, while the abundance of Pseudomys gracilicaudatus remained relatively unchanged by the clipping.
   6. Two species that are abundant on early succession stages in dry heath succession, but occurred at very low abundance on these wet heath habitats before clipping, P. novaehollandiae (New Holland mouse) and Mus domesticus (house mouse), showed marked increases in abundance on clipped and control plots soon after clipping.
   7. An abundance index based on the standardized difference between clipped and control plots, was used to assess responses to habitat manipulation. Rattus lutreolus demonstrated significant negative index values, Pseudomys gracilicaudatus had index values close to zero until the winter census, P. novaehollandiae and Mus domesticus showed positive abundance indices soon after clipping. The order of significant responses to the habitat manipulation was revealed as: Mus domesticus-->Pseudomys novaehollandiae--> P. gracilicaudatus--> Rattus lutreolus.
   8. The impact of a habitat manipulation experiment on these four species of rodents produced a retrogression of the small-mammal succession. This demonstrated a causal role for vegetation density, which provided insight into the mechanisms that operate during the succession following fire, and supported the habitat accommodation model for animal succession.

AB Although inbreeding depression is a major genetic phenomena influencing individual fitness, it is difficult to measure in wild populations. An alternative approach is to correlate heterozygosity, measured using highly polymorphic markers, with a fitness-correlated trait. In clonal plants, genet size is predicted to be fitness correlated. Here we test the prediction that the genet size distribution of the marine clonal plant Zostera marina (eelgrass) is influenced by inbreeding depression. We used nine polymorphic microsatellite markers to access the fine scale clonal structure and to measure individual heterozygosity within 4 plots (each corresponds to 256 m(2) , sampled at 1-m intervals) in two populations along the German Baltic Coast. The same plots were also sampled for flowering and vegetative shoots to obtain estimates for sexual reproductive output at the level of the genetic individual. We found substantial differences in the genet size distribution between the two populations that may be explained by different disturbance frequency. In both populations, clone size was significantly positively correlated with the total number of flowering shoots, indicating that larger clones have a higher reproductive output. Individual heterozygosity was significantly positively associated with clone size. The effect was much stronger in Falkenstein (low disturbance) than in Maasholm (high disturbance). The results indicate that in a low disturbance population the relatively outbred clones occupy a higher proportion of the available space, possibly because they outcompete relatively inbred neighbours.

AB Eld's deer (Cervus eldi) is a highly endangered cervid, distributed historically throughout much of South Asia and Indochina. We analysed variation in the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region for representatives of all three Eld's deer subspecies to gain a better understanding of the genetic population structure and evolutionary history of this species. A phylogeny of mtDNA haplotypes indicates that the critically endangered and ecologically divergent C. eldi eldi is related more closely to C. e. thamin than to C. e. siamensis, a result that is consistent with biogeographic considerations. The results also suggest a strong degree of phylogeographic structure both between subspecies and among populations within subspecies, suggesting that dispersal of individuals between populations has been very limited historically. Haplotype diversity was relatively high for two of the three subspecies (thamin and siamensis), indicating that recent population declines have not yet substantially eroded genetic diversity. In contrast, we found no haplotype variation within C. eldi eldi or the Hainan Island population of C. eldi siamensis, two populations which are known to have suffered severe population bottlenecks. We also compared levels of haplotype and nucleotide diversity in an unmanaged captive population, a managed captive population and a relatively healthy wild population. Diversity indices were higher in the latter two, suggesting the efficacy of well-designed breeding programmes for maintaining genetic diversity in captivity. Based on significant genetic differentiation among Eld's deer subspecies, we recommend the continued management of this species in three distinct evolutionarily significant units (ESUs). Where possible, it may be advisable to translocate individuals between isolated populations within a subspecies to maintain levels of genetic variation in remaining Eld's deer populations.

AB Nutrient loading stimulates N retranslocation, an important mechanism of N reuse in plants to support new growth. We quantified N retranslocation in young black spruce [Picea mariana (Mill.) BSP] using tracer and nontracer techniques to examine enhanced field performance after nutrient loading. Nursery reared seedlings were transplanted to sand-filled pots fertilized with (NH4)-N-15 (NO3)-N-15 at rates equivalent to 0 and 200 kg N ha(-1) simulating poor and rich soils. After one growing season (120 d), biomass increased (118%) on the poor soil without N gain demonstrating the significance of internal N reserves for retranslocation to new growth. Nutrient loading improved retranslocation (218%) and new biomass (156%) after planting confirming the advantage of higher preplant N reserves (175%) for later nutrient demand. Enhanced N availability in the rich soil accelerated growth (236%), N uptake (258%), and retranslocation (23%) in seedlings. Retranslocation increased with time reflecting higher N demand as seedlings become larger and suggest the process is driven by sink strength. Nontracer estimates of N retranslocation in seedlings fell short of isotopic determinations because of, inability to discriminate between soil and plant derived N in tree components. Although fertilization promoted N uptake (125-258%), N-15 recovery in plants averaged 12 to 19% indicating low fertilizer efficiency in young trees. Total reliance of unfertilized plants on internal N reserves for growth on the poor soil affirms the importance of retranslocation to meet plant N demands, and also exemplifies initial short-term independence on soil N for newly planted seedlings that can be prolonged by nutrient loading.

AB The first hypervariable fragment (HVI) of the mitochondrial DNA control region was sequenced in 90 individuals of the European roe deer (Capreolus capreolus ) from the Alps, central Italy and Spain. Pooling these data with 70 published sequences from several European regions, we were able to identify patterns of divergence within the Italian peninsula, and in Europe in general. The results we obtained can be summarized as follows. First, the genetic structure of European roe deer populations is substantial (Phi(ST) values around 0.6). Second, the divergence between some central Italian populations, the Alpine group (which is genetically close to the French, the Spanish and the Norwegian samples) and the Eastern European populations seems to reflect Upper Pleistocene subdivisions, possibly related to three southern European refugia. Third, a different group of central Italian individuals probably diverged more recently from the Alpine group, and their attribution to the subspecies C. c. italicus does not appear justified. Fourth, the analysis of mitochondrial DNA in the roe deer can be used to identify recently reintroduced animals in the western Alps which clearly cluster within the Eastern European group, thus providing an important tool for conservation and management strategies for this species.

AB In the Fiji Islands, female yellow-lipped sea kraits (Laticauda colubrina ) grow much larger than males, and have longer and wider heads than do conspecific males of the same body length. This morphological divergence is accompanied by (and may be adaptive to) a marked sex divergence in dietary habits. Adult female sea kraits feed primarily on large conger eels, and take only a single prey item per foraging bout. In contrast, adult males feed upon smaller moray eels, and frequently take multiple prey items. Prey size increases with snake body size in both males and females, but the sexes follow different trajectories in this respect. Female sea kraits consume larger eels relative to predator head size and body length than do males. Thus, the larger relative head size of female sea kraits is interpreted as an adaptation to consuming larger prey items. Our results are similar to those of previous studies on American water snakes (natricines) and Australian file snakes (acrochordids), indicating that similar patterns of sex divergence in dietary habits and feeding structures have evolved convergently in at least three separate lineages of aquatic snakes.

AB This study investigated how demographic characteristics of black rat snakes Elaphe obsoleta are affected by the length of the active season, and also used the resulting demographic data to determine the proximate factors responsible for male-biased sexual size dimorphism (SSD) in the species. Demographic data collected from 1981 to 1998 in Ontario (ON; 583 males and 588 females) and from 1942 to 1976 in Maryland (MD; 180 males and 150 females) were used to develop growth models with the von Bertalanffy growth equation. Instantaneous growth rates declined significantly with increasing snout-vent length (SVL) in males and females of each population. The growth models predicted age using SVL satisfactorily, but the accuracy of the model decreased significantly with increasing SVL. As predicted, based on the brevity of their active season (ON approximate to 135 days, MD approximate to 190 days), rat snakes of both sexes from Ontario had lower and more variable instantaneous growth rates and matured at a more advanced age (ON 9 years, MD approximate to 4 years) than snakes from Maryland. However, the rapid growth and early maturation in Maryland snakes occurred at the expense of longevity (maximum: ON approximate to 30 years, MD approximate to 20 years). Slower growth and later maturation will make rat snakes in Ontario less capable of recovering from population declines. Within each population, males grew faster than females. Survivorship for Ontario snakes did not vary by sex, but increased significantly with increasing SVL. The demographic consequence of sex differences in growth was a male-biased sex ratio among larger snakes. Because SSD is a function of males growing faster than females, SSD in black rat snakes is probably a product of sexual selection, suggesting that large size confers a mating advantage in males.

AB The diversity of future landscapes might depend on our ability to predict their potential species richness. The predictability of patterns of vascular plant species richness in a Finnish agricultural river landscape was studied using generalized linear modeling, floristic records from fifty-three 0.25-km grid squares in the "core" study area, and environmental variables derived from Landsat TM images and a digital elevation model. We built multiple regression models for the total number of plant species and the number of rarities, and validated the accuracy of the derived models with a test set of 52 grid squares. We tentatively extrapolated the models from the core study area to the whole study area of 601 km(2) and produced species richness probability maps using GIS techniques. The results suggest that the local 'hotspots' of total flora (grid squares with > 200 species) are mainly found in river valleys, where habitat diversity is high and a semi-open agricultural-forest mosaic occurs. The 'hotspots' of rare species (grid squares with > 4 rare species) are also found in river valleys, in sites where extensive semi-natural grasslands and herb-rich deciduous forests occur on steep slopes. We conclude that environmental variables derived from satellite images and topographic data can be used as approximate surrogates of plant species diversity in agricultural landscapes. Modeling of biological diversity based on satellite images and GIS can provide useful information needed in land use planning. However, due to the potential pitfalls in processing satellite imagery and model-building procedures, the results of predictive models should be carefully interpreted.

AB Populations of the Asian elephant (Elephas maximus) have been reduced in size and become highly fragmented during the past 3000 to 4000 years. Historical records reveal elephant dispersal by humans via trade and war. How have these anthropogenic impacts affected genetic variation and structure of Asian elephant populations? We sequenced mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) to assay genetic variation and phylogeography across much of the Asian elephant's range. Initially we compare cytochrome b sequences (cyt b) between nine Asian and five African elephants and use the fossil-based age of their separation (similar to5 million years ago) to obtain a rate of about 0.013 (95% CI = 0.011-0.018) corrected sequence divergence per million years. We also assess variation in part of the mtDNA control region (CR) and adjacent tRNA genes in 57 Asian elephants from seven countries (Sri Lanka, India, Nepal, Myanmar, Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia). Asian elephants have typical levels of mtDNA variation, and coalescence analyses suggest their populations were growing in the late Pleistocene. Reconstructed phylogenies reveal two major clades (A and B) differing on average by HKY85/Gamma -corrected distances of 0.020 for cyt b and 0.050 for the CR segment (corresponding to a coalescence time based on our cyt b rate of similar to1.2 million years). Individuals of both major clades exist in all locations but Indonesia and Malaysia. Most elephants from Malaysia and all from Indonesia are in well-supported, basal clades within clade A, thus supporting their status as evolutionarily significant units (ESUs). The proportion of clade A individuals decreases to the north, which could result from retention and subsequent loss of ancient lineages in long-term stable populations or, perhaps more likely, via recent mixing of two expanding populations that were isolated in the mid-Pleistocene. The distribution of clade A individuals appears to have been impacted by human trade in elephants among Myanmar. Sri Lanka, and India, and the subspecies and ESU statuses of Sri Lankan elephants are not supported by molecular data.

AB Mass spawning of corals provides a large seasonal pulse of high-energy prey that potentially benefits reef fish that are capable of capturing and digesting coral propagules. This study examines the range of fish species that consume coral propagules and also tests whether reef fish experience a significant increase in physiological condition when feeding on coral propagules. Thirty-six species of diurnal reef fish were seen to consume coral propagules released during mass coral spawning. Stomach content analyses of three reef fish species (Pomacentrus moluccensis, Abudefduf whitleyi, and Caesio cunning) revealed that both P. motuccensis and A. whitleyi feed almost exclusively on coral propagules during mass coral spawning. Fish feeding extensively on coral propagules also amassed considerable lipid stores, which could greatly improve the quality and survivorship of their progeny. In contrast, C. cunning consumed only very small quantities of coral propagules, and showed no detectable change in lipid stores during the course of the study. This study provides the first direct evidence that reef fish benefit from mass coral spawning, and reveals a potentially significant trophic link between scleractinian corals and reef fish.

AB The biogeographical distribution of brown trout mitochondrial DNA haplotypes throughout the Iberian Peninsula was established by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment polymorphism analysis. The study of 507 specimens from 58 localities representing eight widely separated Atlantic-slope (north and west Iberian coasts) and six Mediterranean drainage systems served to identify five main groups of mitochondrial haplotypes: (i) haplotypes corresponding to non-native, hatchery-reared brown trout that were widely distributed but also found in wild populations of northern Spain (Cantabrian slope); (ii) a widespread Atlantic haplotype group; (iii) a haplotype restricted to the Duero Basin; (iv) a haplotype shown by southern Iberian populations; and (v) a Mediterranean haplotype. The Iberian distribution of these haplotypes reflects both the current fishery management policy of introducing non-native brown trout, and Messinian palaeobiogeography. Our findings complement and extend previous allozyme studies on Iberian brown trout and improve present knowledge of glacial refugia and postglacial movement of brown trout lineages.

AB 1. It is common practice to express measurements of leaf composition and morphology using dry mass as a basis. Relationships established using these measurements are difficult to interpret because the leaves may have different liquid contents or fractional air space.
   2, In a previous theoretical investigation, we showed that the liquid content of leaves was important and the following hypotheses were proposed: (1) the mass of nitrogen per unit mass of liquid is relatively constant within leaves and (2) the surface area to volume ratio of leaves is proportional to leaf liquid content. That investigation also proposed that fractional air spaces were important, because they confer plasticity in construction, with apparently minimal cost in terms of CO2 uptake. In this paper we use a set of comprehensive measurements to address the above hypotheses and to assess whether the fractional air space does vary in a consistent manner.
   3, We found that the specific gravity of the non-gaseous fraction in the leaves we measured was within the range approximate to 0.9-3.0 and increased with the fractional air space in a regular manner. Consequently, the specific gravity varied over a much smaller range (approximate to 0.9-1.4). The specific gravity at high liquid contents approached unity but at low liquid contents it was variable.
   4, The mass of nitrogen (N) per unit mass of liquid was found to be relatively constant (0.01 +/- 0.003, n = 76).
   5. The surface area to volume ratio was positively correlated with the liquid content (R-2 = 0.87, n = 27).
   6, The mass of carbon (C) per unit dry mass was relatively constant (0.49 +/- 0.04, n = 76). Because N was a constant fraction of the liquid mass but C was a constant fraction of the dry mass, the N:C ratio was positively correlated with the liquid content (R-2 = 0.76, n = 27).
   7. A comparison with leaf measurements from several external databases confirm that the relationships described above are widely applicable.
   8. It is concluded that the composition and morphology of leaves are linked and that leaf function is a consequence of that linkage. Both the liquids and air spaces are integral to leaf function and need to be considered in analysis of experimental results.

AB The nutritional value to abalone of Ulva lactuca L. with different tissue nitrogen levels was studied. The seaweed was cultured at two levels of ammonia-N enrichment. Cultures receiving 0.5 g ammonia-N m(-2) d(-1) ("low-N") yielded 164 g m(-2) d(-1) of fresh thalli containing 12% crude protein in dry matter and 12 kJ g(-1) energy; cultures receiving 10 g ammonia-N m(-2) d(-1) ("high-N") produced 105 g of fresh thalli m(-2) d(-1) containing 44% protein and 16 kJ g(-1) energy. High-Nand low-N algae and a "standard" mixed diet of 75% U. lactuca and 25% Gracilaria conferta (w/w) containing 33% protein and 15 kJ g(-1) energy were fed to juvenile (0.7-2.1 g) and adult (6.9-19.6 g) Haliotis tuberculata and H. discus hannai in a 16-week feeding trial. Voluntary feed intake of the high-N and standard diets were significantly lower than the low-N diet in all the cases. Clear differences in performance between treatments were found in the juvenile and adult abalone of both species. Juveniles fed high-N and standard diets grew significantly faster (specific growth rate of H. tuberculata was 1.03% day(-1) on high-N algae as compared to 0.72% on low-N algae; H. discus hannai grew 0.63 and 0.3% day(-1) on high- and low-N algae, respectively) and showed much better food conversion ratios. The nutritional value of Ulva lactuca to abalone is greatly improved by a high protein content, attainable by culturing the seaweed with high supply rates of ammonia.

AB The relative importance of recruitment and post-recruitment factors in controlling population fluctuations and determining population sizes in open marine systems is still poorly understood. To address this issue, I conducted an experiment investigating whether very early post-recruitment mortality of a coral reef fish, Thalassoma bifasciatum, is dependent on recruitment density. To quantify the extent to which local populations are likely to be controlled primarily by recruitment or by post-settlement density-dependent mortality, I also measured natural mortality rates and recruitment variation at sites around the island of St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands.
   I manipulated densities of 1-3-d post-settlement T. bifasciatum on large natural patch reefs in Tague Bay, St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands. Manipulated recruits were followed for similar to 30 d. The loss rate over the initial 24-h period following placement of recruits on the reef was positively related to the density at the beginning of that period. After this period, initial recruit density had no effects on mortality.
   Natural monthly mortality rates approximating the monthly mortality monitored during the experiment were measured for naturally recruited fish at sites around the island. Mortality was positively correlated with recruitment density. The effect was strong enough that across sites the relationship between recruit density and juvenile density the following month was not proportional; that is, juvenile density tended to reach an asymptote with increasing recruitment. The relationship between total recruitment per season at a site and adult abundance at the end of the season was similarly asymptotic, indicating the persistence of a density-dependent effect at the scale of the island.
   Mortality rates around the island were extremely variable and density independent at densities below similar to 1 recruit/m(2). Above that level, mortality rates were higher and tended to increase with further increases in recruitment density. Around St. Croix, three out of eight sites consistently received recruitment above this "threshold," while five sites never experienced recruitment above that level during the study. Because spatial patterns of recruitment around St. Croix were consistent over time, some local populations may be controlled mainly by recruitment and density-independent mortality at all times, while others may be chronically affected by post-settlement density dependence. This study gives support to the idea that recruitment limitation and density dependence are not mutually exclusive. Rather, local populations must be characterized by the degree of recruitment, the resultant population density, and the subsequent degree of density-dependent regulation.

AB Effects of snow-melt timing on leaf traits (for five deciduous and five evergreen species), shoot growth, and leaf production (for five evergreen species) of tundra plants were studied along a snow-melt gradient in an alpine snowbed in northern Sweden. In deciduous plants, leaf life-span and leaf mass per area (LMA) decreased, and nitrogen concentration (leaf N) increased with decreasing growing season, whereas in evergreen plants, both leaf life-span and leaf N increased with decreasing growing season. By extending leaf life-span, evergreen plants are able to have a large leaf mass, which may contribute to maintain net annual carbon gain in short snow-free seasons. In two predominantly boreal evergreen species, Empetrum hermaphroditum and Vaccinium vitis-idaea, leaf lifespan was negatively correlated with both annual leaf production and shoot growth, but there were no similar significant correlations for the other three, strictly arctic-alpine evergreen species (Cassiope tetragona, Loiseleuria procumbens, and Dispensia lapponica). Based on these results, we predict that extension of season length will decrease leaf N of both deciduous and evergreen species, and will accelerate leaf turnover of evergreen plants. Although annual leaf production and shoot growth of boreal species may increase with an extension of season length, they will remain unchanged in strictly arctic-alpine species.

AB This paper incorporates the cumulative effect of water stress, in a phenomenological model of stomatal conductance of upper canopy foliage (g(su)) for Eucalyptus globulus and Eucalyptus nitens. Maximum observed stomatal conductance of irrigated trees was moderated by three functions describing the response of g(su) to light, air temperature and vapour pressure deficit. This model explained 70% of the variation in g(su) of irrigated trees using the same parameter values for both species. Daily total conductance was calculated for rainfed (G(su,R)) and irrigated (G(su,I)) trees. Linear relationships between the ratio of G(su,R)/G(su,I) (f(W)) and pre-dawn water potential explained only 46 and 30%, respectively, of variation in f(W) for E, globulus and E. nitens. The average value of pre-dawn water potential for the preceding x days (<(S-Psi x)over bar> was calculated for a range of values of x. When x was 8 for E. globulus and 20 for E. nitens a single exponential decay function accounted for 70% of variation in f(W) for both species. This result and the number of days over which it was necessary to calculate (<(S-Psi x)over bar>) were consistent with previous studies of the leaf water relations, canopy and sapwood development, and stomatal behaviour of the two species.

AB Most coral reef fish have a bipartite Life-history characterized by a pelagic larval phase followed by transformation and settlement into a benthic existence. There is increasing interest among marine ecologists in determining the importance of post-settlement processes to reef fish demography. This study distinguishes movement as an important post-settlement phenomenon affecting estimates of early survivorship of juvenile coral reef fishes. Individuals settling onto artificial patch habitats were collected, marked, released and monitored by visual census over 2 systems of isolated artificial patch habitats. Some recently settled juvenile fish moved as much as 100 m over open sand. Probability of movement was dependent on species; size was a significant factor among species, but not among conspecifics. Survivorship calculated from observations of uniquely marked individuals was contrasted with survivorship estimated by comparing the initial number of newly settled individuals at a site with the number of individuals there after a given time interval. The comparison revealed that new settlers and immigrants can mask the loss of individuals included in the original census and thereby inflate estimates of survivorship. Comparing survival estimates with and without accounting for movement demonstrated that survivorship can be underestimated when new settlers subsequently emigrate and survive at another site, but are unwittingly recorded as lost due to mortality. Significant differences were observed in survival experiences for different species and size classes. Where significant differences were found in survival times of mobile individuals versus sedentary, those that moved survived longer.

AB Tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) plants transformed with 'antisense' rbcS to decrease the expression of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase (Rubisco) have been used to investigate the contribution of Rubisco to the control of photosynthesis in plants growing at different irradiances. Tobacco plants were grown in controlled-climate chambers under ambient CO2 at 20-degrees-C at 100, 300 and 750 mumol.m-2.s-1 irradiance, and at 28-degrees-C at 100, 300 and 1000 mumol.m-2.2-1 irradiance. (i) Measurement of photosynthesis under ambient conditions showed that the flux control coefficient of Rubisco (C(Rubisco)A) was very low (0.01-0.03) at low growth irradiance, and still fairly low (0.24-0.27) at higher irradiance. (ii) Short-term changes in the irradiance used to measure photosynthesis showed that C(Rubisco)A increases as incident irradiance rises. (iii) When low-light (100 mumol.m-2.s-1)-grown plants are exposed to high (750-1000 mumol-m-2.s-1) irradiance, Rubisco is almost totally limiting for photosynthesis in wild types. However, when high-light-grown leaves (750-1000 mumol.m-2-s-1) are suddenly exposed to high and saturating irradiance (1500-2000 mumol.m-2.s-1), C(Rubisco)A remained relatively low (0.23-0.33), showing that in saturating light Rubisco only exerts partial control over the light-saturated rate of photosynthesis in ''sun'' leaves; apparently additional factors are co-limiting photosynthetic performance. (iv) Growth of plants at high irradiance led to a small decrease in the percentage of total protein found in the insoluble (thylakoid fraction), and a decrease of chlorophyll, relative to protein or structural leaf dry weight. As a consequence of this change, high-irradiance-grown leaves illuminated at growth irradiance avoided an inbalance between the ''light'' reactions and Rubisco; this was shown by the low value of C(Rubisco)A (see above) and by measurements showing that non-photochemical quenching was low, photochemical quenching high, and NADP-malate dehydrogenase activation was low at the. growth irradiance. In contrast, when a leaf adapted to low irradiance was illuminated at a higher irradiance, Rubisco exerted more control, non-photochemical quenching was higher, photochemical quenching was lower, and NADP-malate dehydrogenase activation was higher than in a leaf which had grown at that irradiance. We conclude that changes in leaf composition allow the leaf to avoid a one-sided limitation by Rubisco and, hence, overexcitation and overreduction of the thylakoids in high-irradiance growth conditions. (v) 'Antisense' plants with less Rubisco contained a higher content of insoluble (thylakoid) protein and chlorophyll, compared to total protein or structural leaf dry weight. They also showed a higher rate of photosynthesis than the wild type, when measured at an irradiance below that at which the plant had grown. We propose that N-allocation in low light is not optimal in tobacco and that genetic manipulation to decrease Rubisco may, in some circumstances, increase photosynthetic performance in low light.

AB Vertical distribution of root density (length per unit soil volume) and abundance (length per unit ground surface area) to a depth of 1.5 m or to the depth of the water table and their relationships with soil properties and tree basal area were examined in 36 soil profiles of pine-oak and oak-pine forests of the New Jersey Pinelands. Soil morphology were almost uniform within the forest type and characterized by the presence of high coarse fragment contents in the C horizon in oak-pine uplands; by the spodic B horizon and water table in the C horizon in pine-oak lowlands; by the sandy soil throughout the profile in pine-oak uplands; and by the firm argillic B horizon in pine-oak plains. Root density decreased from ranges of 44423-133369 m m-3 in the 0-5 cm depth in all the forest types to 1900-5593 m m-3 in the 100-150 cm depth in all the forest types except in pine-oak lowlands. Total profile root density and abundance was in the order: oak-pine uplands > pine-oak lowlands > pine-oak uplands > pine-oak plains. Root density correlated positively with organic C, total N, water soluble P, exchangeable Ca, Mg, K, Al, Fe, and cation exchange capacity, and negatively with bulk density, coarse fraction content, and pH, whereas root abundance correlated positively with organic C, total N, water soluble P, exchangeable Ca, Mg, K, and Fe, and negatively with bulk density. No correlation existed between root density and abundance with tree basal area. Higher root density in the E horizon of oak-pine uplands as compared to the other forest types was associated with high nutrient content; higher root density in the C horizon of pine-oak lowlands was associated with a shallow water table beneath the horizon; and lower root densities in the B and C horizons of pine-oak plains were associated with the presence of a firm clay layer in the B horizon.

ID ANTHROPOCENE; DIVERSITY; DRIVERS; RISK
AB During the Anthropocene, humans are changing the Earth system in ways that will be detectable for millennia to come [1]. Biologically, these changes include habitat destruction, biotic homogenization, increased species invasions, and accelerated extinctions [2]. Contemporary extinction rates far surpass background rates [3], but they seem remarkably low in plants [4, 5]. However, biodiversity is not evenly distributed, and as a result, extinction rates may vary among regions. Some authors have contentiously argued that novel anthropic habitats and human-induced plant speciation can actually increase regional biodiversity [6, 7]. Here, we report on one of the most comprehensive datasets to date, including regional and global plant extinctions in both biodiversity hotspots (mostly from Mediterranean-type climate regions) and coldspots (mostly from Eurasian countries). Our data come from regions covering 15.3% of the Earth's surface and span over 300 years. With this dataset, we explore the trends, causes, and temporal dynamics of recent plant extinctions. We found more, and faster accrual of, absolute numbers of extinction events in biodiversity hotspots compared to coldspots. Extinction rates were also substantially higher than historical background rates, but recent declines are evident. We found higher levels of taxonomic uniqueness being lost in biodiversity coldspots compared to hotspots. Causes of plant extinctions also showed distinct temporal patterns, with agriculture, invasions, and urbanization being significant drivers in hotspots, while hydrological disturbance was an important driver in coldspots. Overall, plant extinctions over the last three centuries appear to be low, with a recent (post-1990) and steady extinction rate of 1.26 extinctions/year.

AB Of all ecosystems, freshwaters support the most dynamic and highly concentrated biodiversity on Earth. These attributes of freshwater biodiversity along with increasing demand for water mean that these systems serve as significant models to understand drivers of global biodiversity change. Freshwater biodiversity changes are often attributed to hydrological alteration by water-resource development and climate change owing to the role of the hydrological regime of rivers, wetlands and floodplains affecting patterns of biodiversity. However, a major gap remains in conceptualising how the hydrological regime determines patterns in biodiversity's multiple spatial components and facets (taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic). We synthesised primary evidence of freshwater biodiversity responses to natural hydrological regimes to determine how distinct ecohydrological mechanisms affect freshwater biodiversity at local, landscape and regional spatial scales. Hydrological connectivity influences local and landscape biodiversity, yet responses vary depending on spatial scale. Biodiversity at local scales is generally positively associated with increasing connectivity whereas landscape-scale biodiversity is greater with increasing fragmentation among locations. The effects of hydrological disturbance on freshwater biodiversity are variable at separate spatial scales and depend on disturbance frequency and history and organism characteristics. The role of hydrology in determining habitat for freshwater biodiversity also depends on spatial scaling. At local scales, persistence, stability and size of habitat each contribute to patterns of freshwater biodiversity yet the responses are variable across the organism groups that constitute overall freshwater biodiversity. We present a conceptual model to unite the effects of different ecohydrological mechanisms on freshwater biodiversity across spatial scales, and develop four principles for applying a multi-scaled understanding of freshwater biodiversity responses to hydrological regimes. The protection and restoration of freshwater biodiversity is both a fundamental justification and a central goal of environmental water allocation worldwide. Clearer integration of concepts of spatial scaling in the context of understanding impacts of hydrological regimes on biodiversity will increase uptake of evidence into environmental flow implementation, identify suitable biodiversity targets responsive to hydrological change or restoration, and identify and manage risks of environmental flows contributing to biodiversity decline.

AB Insects and other invertebrates can readily adapt to a range of environmental conditions and these include conditions used in artificial rearing. This can lead to problems when mass rearing insects and mites for release as biocontrol agents or in sterile insect control programs, and when using laboratory strains to understand field population dynamics. Laboratory adaptation experiments also help to understand potential rates of trait evolution and repeatability of evolutionary changes. Here, we review evidence for laboratory adaptation across invertebrates, contrasting different taxonomic groups and providing estimates of the rate of evolutionary change across trait classes. These estimates highlight rapid changes in the order of 0.033 (median) haldanes and up to 2.4 haldanes, along with proportional changes in traits of more than 10% per generation in some cases. Traits tended to change in the direction of increased fitness for Coleoptera, Diptera and Hymenoptera, but changes in Lepidoptera were often in the opposite direction. Laboratory-adapted lines tend to be more sensitive to stress, likely reflecting relaxed selection for stress-related traits. Morphological traits show smaller changes under laboratory conditions than other types of traits. Estimates of evolutionary rates slowed as more generations were included in comparisons, perhaps reflecting nonlinear dynamics although such patterns may also reflect variance differences among trait classes. The rapid rate of laboratory adaptation in some cultures reinforces the need to develop guidelines for maintaining quality during mass rearing and highlights the need for caution when using laboratory lines to represent the performance of species in vulnerability assessments.

AB Species coexistence in diverse communities likely results from multiple interacting factors. Mechanisms such as conspecific negative density dependence (CNDD) and varying life-history strategies related to resource partitioning are known to influence plant fitness, and thereby community composition and diversity. However, we have little understanding of how these mechanisms interact and how they vary across life stages. Here, we document the interaction between CNDD and life-history strategy, based on growth-mortality trade-offs, from seedling to adult tree for 47 species in a tropical forest. Species' life-history strategies remained consistent across stages: fast-growing species had higher mortality than slow-growing species at all stages. In contrast, mean CNDD was strongest at early life stages (i.e. seedling, sapling). Fast-growing species tended to suffer greater CNDD than slow-growing species at several, but not all life stages. Overall, our results demonstrate that coexistence mechanisms interact across multiple life stages to shape diverse tree communities.

AB Colonization and expansion into novel landscapes determine the distribution and abundance of species in our rapidly changing ecosystems worldwide. Colonization events are crucibles for rapid evolution, but it is not known whether evolutionary changes arise mainly after successful colonization has occurred, or if evolution plays an immediate role, governing the growth and expansion speed of colonizing populations. There is evidence that spatial evolutionary processes can speed range expansion within a few generations because dispersal tendencies may evolve upwards at range edges. Additionally, rapid adaptation to a novel environment can increase population growth rates, which also promotes spread. However, the role of adaptive evolution and the relative contributions of spatial evolution and adaptation to expansion are unclear. Using a model system, red flour beetles (Tribolium castaneum), we either allowed or constrained evolution of populations colonizing a novel environment and measured population growth and spread. At the end of the experiment we assessed the fitness and dispersal tendency of individuals originating either from the core or edge of evolving populations or from nonevolving populations in a common garden. Within six generations, evolving populations grew three times larger and spread 46% faster than populations in which evolution was constrained. Increased size and expansion speed were strongly driven by adaptation, whereas spatial evolutionary processes acting on edge subpopulations contributed less. This experimental evidence demonstrates that rapid evolution drives both population growth and expansion speed and is thus crucial to consider for managing biological invasions and successfully introducing or reintroducing species for management and conservation.

AB An increasing number of studies demonstrate the need of applying a social-ecological system approach for landscape planning. However, there is a lack of empirical research that operationalizes the concept of social ecological system for landscape planning through the characterization of social-ecological interactions. In this study, we develop a methodological framework to delineate the boundaries of social-ecological systems and to characterize their main social-ecological units in a spatially explicit way. Social-ecological units represent the interactions between the biophysical and socio-economic sub-systems at local scale. The methodology is structured in four phases: (1) ecological regionalization, i.e. identification and mapping of consistent ecological units based on biophysical variables; (2) socio-economic regionalization, i.e. identification and mapping of homogeneous groups of municipalities based on socio-economic variables; (3) identification of social-ecological systems boundaries and characterization of social-ecological units; and (4) validation of the social-ecological systems boundaries with key informants through participatory mapping. By applying the proposed methodological framework to three different Mediterranean cultural landscapes, we define the boundaries of social ecological systems and illustrate how social and ecological sub-systems interact at local scale. We conclude that the proposed methodological framework is useful to operationalize the concept of social-ecological systems in landscape planning.

AB In order to evaluate the ecological influence of hydraulic projects, aquatic habitat suitability modeling was proposed. Compared with other environmental flow methods, this method, for the first time, integrate considering hydrology parameters and ecology attributes, quantitatively describing the relationships between species and habitat. Aquatic habitat suitability models began with one-dimensional physical habitat Simulation model (PHABSIM) at micro-scale physical habitat. Afterwards, habitat suitability models for meso- and macro-scale were developed; eco-factors indicating physical habitat and water quality situation were included; two and three-dimensional model were employed to provide the situation of eco-factors. Based on field survey or mathematical models, the state of habitat eco-factors can be obtained. By establishing habitat suitability evaluation criteria, the impact of aquatic habitats on the particular life stage of indicate species can be assessed, the effect of reservoir regulation mode and habitat restoration projections can be predicted. Here,we summarized aquatic habitat suitability models in different spatial scale, and the advantages and disadvantage, of each model were analyzed and concluded.

AB Understanding how natural selection generates and maintains adaptive genetic diversity in heterogeneous environments is key to predicting the evolutionary response of populations to rapid environmental change. Detecting selection in complex spatial environments remains challenging, especially for threatened species where the effects of strong genetic drift may overwhelm signatures of selection. We carried out a basinwide riverscape genomic analysis in the threatened southern pygmy perch (Nannoperca australis), an ecological specialist with low dispersal potential. High-resolution environmental data and 5162 high-quality filtered SNPs were used to clarify spatial population structure and to assess footprints of selection associated with a steep hydroclimatic gradient and with human disturbance across the naturally and anthropogenically fragmented Murray-Darling Basin (Australia). Our approach included FST outlier tests to define neutral loci, and a combination of spatially explicit genotype-environment association analyses to identify candidate adaptive loci while controlling for the effects of landscape structure and shared population history. We found low levels of genetic diversity and strong neutral population structure consistent with expectations based on spatial stream hierarchy and life history. In contrast, variables related to precipitation and temperature appeared as the most important environmental surrogates for putatively adaptive genetic variation at both regional and local scales. Human disturbance also influenced the variation in candidate loci for adaptation, but only at a local scale. Our study contributes to understanding of adaptive evolution along naturally and anthropogenically fragmented ecosystems. It also offers a tangible example of the potential contributions of landscape genomics for informing in situ and ex situ conservation management of biodiversity.

AB Understanding host-parasite interactions requires that the multi-faceted relationships among ecological, behavioral and molecular processes be characterized and integrated. The introduced parasitic fly of birds, Philornis downsi (Diptera: Muscidae), was accidentally introduced to the Galapagos Islands circa 1960s and the consequences of its introduction represent one of the most challenging conservation battles faced within host-parasite ecology today. Larvae of the fly were first discovered in nests of Darwin's finches (Passeriformes: Thraupidae) in 1997. The parasitic fly larvae are killing similar to 55 % of Darwin's finch nestlings within nests by consuming the blood and tissue of developing birds, whereby the number of parasitic fly larvae in nests has increased by 46 % from 2000 to 2013. As nestlings increasingly die at an earlier age, which signifies earlier resource termination for the parasite, similar to 17 % of fly larvae also die. Several local finch populations have become extinct but some host species have increased in abundance, and as a consequence, may be sustaining P. downsi populations along with other non-finch hosts. The high mortality in both Darwin's finches and P. downsi larvae creates opportunity and imperative to understand the coevolutionary dynamics of this newly evolving host-parasite system. This review examines the rapid changes in host and parasite ecology, behavior, and genetics since P. downsi larvae were first discovered in Darwin's finch nests. The aim of the review is to synthesize what is known about this lethal host-parasite system and to describe rapid changes in host and parasite biology that characterize the novel association. An over-arching goal is the implementation of conservation outcomes that are informed by evolutionary biological understanding of invasive species.

AB Plant functional types (or guilds) increasingly are being used to predict vegetation response to global changes. Continued human population growth coupled with projected warmer and drier climate will alter the hydrologic regimes of many arid-zone rivers, including intermittent rivers. We aimed to identify (i) woody plant guilds associated with distinct stream types of an arid region and (ii) plant traits indicating adaptation to the selective pressures of water availability and fluvial disturbance. We used hierarchical clustering to identify 11 plant guilds from floodplains, terraces and uplands of eight Arizona rivers that vary in surface flow permanence, depth to ground water and intensity of fluvial disturbance. Six guilds were riparian pioneers with small, wind-dispersed seeds, three guilds were late-seral, shade-tolerant riparian taxa with large animal-dispersed seeds, and two guilds were composed of desert xerophytes. Within the riparian pioneer and seral groups, guilds varied in water acquisition and productivity traits including wood density and rooting depth. The community-weighted traits varied or covaried with water availability and fluvial disturbance. Root: shoot ratio, canopy height and leaf area were influenced strongly by water availability, with the latter two showing a nonlinear response to changes in water table depth. Leaf length increased, and wood density decreased, as sites become wetter and more fluvially disturbed. Community-weighted seed mass, seed dispersal and spinesence varied most strongly with elevation above thalweg (an indicator of decreasing fluvial disturbance). These analyses will enable prediction of changes in the relative abundance of plant types and plant traits in response to changes in stream flow regimes, such as shifts towards greater intermittency. The distribution patterns of guilds among riparian habitat types emphasise the importance of focusing conservation efforts not only on the limited number of perennial rivers remaining in arid regions, but also on intermittent and ephemeral rivers with shallow water tables.

AB High landscape diversity is assumed to increase the number and level of ecosystem services. However, the interactions between ecosystem service provision, disturbance and landscape composition are poorly understood. Here we present a novel approach to include uncertainty in the optimization of land allocation for improving the provision of multiple ecosystem services. We refer to the rehabilitation of abandoned agricultural lands in Ecuador including two types of both afforestation and pasture rehabilitation, together with a succession option. Our results show that high compositional landscape diversity supports multiple ecosystem services (multifunction effect). This implicitly provides a buffer against uncertainty. Our work shows that active integration of uncertainty is only important when optimizing single or highly correlated ecosystem services and that the multifunction effect on landscape diversity is stronger than the uncertainty effect. This is an important insight to support a land-use planning based on ecosystem services.

AB 1. Long-term soil chronosequences provide natural soil fertility gradients that can be used to explore linkages between soils and plant community composition and diversity. Well-studied forested soil chronosequences have revealed that local (a) plant diversity increases with greater soil age and declining fertility, but corresponding changes in species turnover and beta (b) diversity have not been explored, particularly in extremely species-rich regions.
   2. We quantified changes in plant species diversity and community composition, and identified the edaphic drivers of these changes, along a >2-million year retrogressive dune chronosequence in the south-west Australia biodiversity hotspot.
   3. We found greater plant species diversity across all growth forms as soil development proceeded and concentrations of soil nutrients, particularly phosphorus (P), diminished to extremely low levels (surface soil total P concentrations of 6 mg P kg(-1)). Despite the high plant a diversity on older nutrient-impoverished soils, species turnover across the chronosequence was exceptionally high when all growth forms were considered (mean of 1% of species shared between the youngest and oldest soils), and there was complete turnover of woody species along the chronosequence. Such extreme species turnover across the chronosequence reflected large changes in soil chemical properties. In addition, b diversity within individual chronosequence stages increased with declining soil fertility. Shrubs remained the dominant and most speciose growth form throughout the chronosequence.
   4. Synthesis. The large increase in plant a diversity and the extreme species turnover associated with declining soil fertility highlight the central role of soil properties in driving plant community assembly during long-term ecosystem development, previously only reported from comparatively species-poor regions. Our finding that plant b diversity increased with declining soil fertility points to a novel mechanism whereby extremely low soil fertility, rather than high productivity, promotes high b diversity. These results suggest that the interaction of an exceptionally diverse plant species pool and nutrient-impoverished soils provides the basis for the maintenance of such high b diversity at extremely low soil fertility.

AB Marginal likelihood estimates to compare models using Bayes factors frequently accompany Bayesian phylogenetic inference. Approaches to estimate marginal likelihoods have garnered increased attention over the past decade. In particular, the introduction of path sampling (PS) and stepping-stone sampling (SS) into Bayesian phylogenetics has tremendously improved the accuracy of model selection. These sampling techniques are now used to evaluate complex evolutionary and population genetic models on empirical data sets, but considerable computational demands hamper their widespread adoption. Further, when very diffuse, but proper priors are specified for model parameters, numerical issues complicate the exploration of the priors, a necessary step in marginal likelihood estimation using PS or SS. To avoid such instabilities, generalized SS (GSS) has recently been proposed, introducing the concept of "working distributions" to facilitate-or shorten-the integration process that underlies marginal likelihood estimation. However, the need to fix the tree topology currently limits GSS in a coalescent-based framework. Here, we extend GSS by relaxing the fixed underlying tree topology assumption. To this purpose, we introduce a "working" distribution on the space of genealogies, which enables estimating marginal likelihoods while accommodating phylogenetic uncertainty. We propose two different "working" distributions that help GSS to outperform PS and SS in terms of accuracy when comparing demographic and evolutionary models applied to synthetic data and real-world examples. Further, we show that the use of very diffuse priors can lead to a considerable overestimation in marginal likelihood when using PS and SS, while still retrieving the correct marginal likelihood using both GSS approaches. The methods used in this article are available in BEAST, a powerful user friendly software package to perform Bayesian evolutionary analyses.

AB Soil carbon (C) storage is a key ecosystem service. Soil C stocks play a vital role in soil fertility and climate regulation, but the factors that control these stocks at regional and national scales are unknown, particularly when their composition and stability are considered. As a result, their mapping relies on either unreliable proxy measures or laborious direct measurements. Using data from an extensive national survey of English grasslands, we show that surface soil (0-7cm) C stocks in size fractions of varying stability can be predicted at both regional and national scales from plant traits and simple measures of soil and climatic conditions. Soil C stocks in the largest pool, of intermediate particle size (50-250m), were best explained by mean annual temperature (MAT), soil pH and soil moisture content. The second largest C pool, highly stable physically and biochemically protected particles (045-50m), was explained by soil pH and the community abundance-weighted mean (CWM) leaf nitrogen (N) content, with the highest soil C stocks under N-rich vegetation. The C stock in the small active fraction (250-4000m) was explained by a wide range of variables: MAT, mean annual precipitation, mean growing season length, soil pH and CWM specific leaf area; stocks were higher under vegetation with thick and/or dense leaves. Testing the models describing these fractions against data from an independent English region indicated moderately strong correlation between predicted and actual values and no systematic bias, with the exception of the active fraction, for which predictions were inaccurate.Synthesis and applications. Validation indicates that readily available climate, soils and plant survey data can be effective in making local- to landscape-scale (1-100000km(2)) soil C stock predictions. Such predictions are a crucial component of effective management strategies to protect C stocks and enhance soil C sequestration.

AB Climate change is likely to shift plant communities towards species from warmer regions, a process termed thermophilization'. In forests, canopy disturbances such as fire may hasten this process by increasing temperature and moisture stress in the understory, yet little is known about the mechanisms that might drive such shifts, or the consequences of these processes for plant diversity. We sampled understory vegetation across a gradient of disturbance severity from a large-scale natural experiment created by the factorial combination of forest thinning and wildfire in California. Using information on evolutionary history and functional traits, we tested the hypothesis that disturbance severity should increase community dominance by species with southern-xeric biogeographic affinities. We also analysed how climatic productivity mediates the effect of disturbance severity, and quantified the functional trait response to disturbance, to investigate potential mechanisms behind thermophilization. The proportion of north-temperate flora decreased, while the proportion of southern-xeric flora increased, with greater disturbance severity and less canopy closure. Disturbance caused a greater reduction of north-temperate flora in productive (wetter) forests, while functional trait analyses suggested that species colonizing after severe disturbance may be adapted to increased water stress. Forests with intermediate disturbance severity, where abundances of northern and southern species were most equitable, had the highest stand-scale understory diversity.Synthesis. Canopy disturbance is likely to accelerate plant community shifts towards species from warmer regions, via its effects on understory microclimate at small scales. Understory diversity can be enhanced by intermediate disturbance regimes that promote the coexistence of species with different biogeographic affinities.

AB Ecosystem responses to climate change can exert positive or negative feedbacks on climate, mediated in part by slow-moving factors such as shifts in vegetation community composition. Long-term experimental manipulations can be used to examine such ecosystem responses, but they also present another opportunity: inferring the extent to which contemporary climate change is responsible for slow changes in ecosystems under ambient conditions. Here, using 23years of data, we document a shift from nonwoody to woody vegetation and a loss of soil carbon in ambient plots and show that these changes track previously shown similar but faster changes under experimental warming. This allows us to infer that climate change is the cause of the observed shifts in ambient vegetation and soil carbon and that the vegetation responses mediate the observed changes in soil carbon. Our findings demonstrate the realism of an experimental manipulation, allow attribution of a climate cause to observed ambient ecosystem changes, and demonstrate how a combination of long-term study of ambient and experimental responses to warming can identify mechanistic drivers needed for realistic predictions of the conditions under which ecosystems are likely to become carbon sources or sinks over varying timescales.

AB Extreme hydro-meteorological events such as droughts are becoming more frequent, intense, and persistent. This is particularly true in the south central USA, where rapidly growing urban areas are running out of water and human-engineered water storage and management are leading to broad-scale changes in flow regimes. The Kiamichi River in southeastern Oklahoma, USA, has high fish and freshwater mussel biodiversity. However, water from this rural river is desired by multiple urban areas and other entities. Freshwater mussels are large, long-lived filter feeders that provide important ecosystem services. We ask how observed changes in mussel biomass and community composition resulting from drought-induced changes in flow regimes might lead to changes in river ecosystem services. We sampled mussel communities in this river over a 20-year period that included two severe droughts. We then used laboratory-derived physiological rates and river-wide estimates of species-specific mussel biomass to estimate three aggregate ecosystem services provided by mussels over this time period: biofiltration, nutrient recycling (nitrogen and phosphorus), and nutrient storage (nitrogen, phosphorus, and carbon). Mussel populations declined over 60%, and declines were directly linked to drought-induced changes in flow regimes. All ecosystem services declined over time and mirrored biomass losses. Mussel declines were exacerbated by human water management, which has increased the magnitude and frequency of hydrologic drought in downstream reaches of the river. Freshwater mussels are globally imperiled and declining around the world. Summed across multiple streams and rivers, mussel losses similar to those we document here could have considerable consequences for downstream water quality although lost biofiltration and nutrient retention. While we cannot control the frequency and severity of climatological droughts, water releases from reservoirs could be used to augment stream flows and prevent compounded anthropogenic stressors.

AB Coral reef fishes differ in their intrinsic vulnerability to fishing and rates of population recovery after cessation of fishing. We reviewed life history-based predictions about the vulnerability of different groups of coral reef fish and examined the empirical evidence for different rates of population recovery inside no-take marine reserves to (1) determine if the empirical data agree with predictions about vulnerability and (2) show plausible scenarios of recovery within fully protected reserves and periodically-harvested fishery closures. In general, larger-bodied carnivorous reef fishes are predicted to be more vulnerable to fishing while smaller-bodied species lower in the food web (e.g., some herbivores) are predicted to be less vulnerable. However, this prediction does not always hold true because of the considerable diversity of life history strategies in reef fishes. Long-term trends in reef fish population recovery inside no-take reserves are consistent with broad predictions about vulnerability, suggesting that moderately to highly vulnerable species will require a significantly longer time (decades) to attain local carrying capacity than less vulnerable species. We recommend: (1) expanding age-based demographic studies of economically and ecologically important reef fishes to improve estimates of vulnerability; (2) long term (20-40 years), if not permanent, protection of no-take reserves to allow full population recovery and maximum biomass export; (3) strict compliance to no-take reserves to avoid considerable delays in recovery; (4) carefully controlling the timing and intensity of harvesting periodic closures to ensure long-term fishery benefits; (5) the use of periodically-harvested closures together with, rather than instead of, permanent no-take reserves.

AB Young species complexes that are widespread across ecologically disparate regions offer important insights into the process of speciation because of their relevance to how local adaptation and gene flow influence diversification. We used mitochondrial DNA and up to 28152 genomewide single nucleotide polymorphisms from polytypic barking frogs (Craugastor augusti complex) to infer phylogenetic relationships and test for the signature of introgressive hybridization among diverging lineages. Our phylogenetic reconstructions suggest (i) a rapid Pliocene-Pleistocene radiation that produced at least nine distinct lineages and (ii) that geographic features of the arid Central Mexican Plateau contributed to two independent northward expansions. Despite clear lineage differentiation (many private alleles and high between-lineage FST scores), D-statistic tests, which differentiate introgression from ancestral polymorphism, allowed us to identify two putative instances of reticulate gene flow. Partitioned D-statistics provided evidence that these events occurred in the same direction between clades but at different points in time. After correcting for geographic distance, we found that lineages involved in hybrid gene flow interactions had higher levels of genetic variation than independently evolving lineages. These findings suggest that the nature of hybrid compatibility can be conserved overlong periods of evolutionary time and that hybridization between diverging lineages may contribute to standing levels of genetic variation.

AB The exceptional species diversity of flowering plants, exceeding that of their sister group more than 250-fold, is especially evident in floral innovations, interactions with pollinators and sexual systems. Multiple theories, emphasizing flower-pollinator interactions, genetic effects of mating systems or high evolvability, predict that floral evolution profoundly affects angiosperm diversification. However, consequences for speciation and extinction dynamics remain poorly understood. Here, we investigate trajectories of species diversification focusing on heterostyly, a remarkable floral syndrome where outcrossing is enforced via cross-compatible floral morphs differing in placement of their respective sexual organs. Heterostyly evolved at least 20 times independently in angiosperms. Using Darwin's model for heterostyly, the primrose family, we show that heterostyly accelerates species diversification via decreasing extinction rates rather than increasing speciation rates, probably owing to avoidance of the negative genetic effects of selfing. However, impact of heterostyly appears to differ over short and long evolutionary time-scales: the accelerating effect of heterostyly on lineage diversification is manifest only over long evolutionary time-scales, whereas recent losses of heterostyly may prompt ephemeral bursts of speciation. Our results suggest that temporal or clade-specific conditions may ultimately determine the net effects of specific traits on patterns of species diversification.

AB Animals exposed to anthropogenic disturbance make trade-offs between perceived risk and the cost of leaving disturbed areas. Impact assessments tend to focus on overt behavioural responses leading to displacement, but trade-offs may also impact individual energy budgets through reduced foraging performance. Previous studies found no evidence for broad-scale displacement of harbour porpoises exposed to impulse noise from a 10 day two-dimensional seismic survey. Here, we used an array of passive acoustic loggers coupled with calibrated noise measurements to test whether the seismic survey influenced the activity patterns of porpoises remaining in the area. We showed that the probability of recording a buzz declined by 15% in the ensonified area and was positively related to distance from the source vessel. We also estimated received levels at the hydrophones and characterized the noise response curve. Our results demonstrate how environmental impact assessments can be developed to assess more subtle effects of noise disturbance on activity patterns and foraging efficiency.

AB Genetic variation is of key importance for a species' evolutionary potential, and its estimation is a major component of conservation studies. New DNA sequencing technologies have enabled the analysis of large portions of the genome in nonmodel species, promising highly accurate estimates of such population genetic parameters. Restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (RADseq) is used to analyse thousands of variants in the bumble bee species Bombus impatiens, which is common, and Bombus pensylvanicus, which is in decline. Previous microsatellite-based analyses have shown that gene diversity is lower in the declining B.pensylvanicus than in B.impatiens. RADseq nucleotide diversities appear much more similar in the two species. Both species exhibit allele frequencies consistent with historical population expansions. Differences in diversity observed at microsatellites thus do not appear to have arisen from long-term differences in population size and are either recent in origin or may result from mutational processes. Additional research is needed to explain these discrepancies and to investigate the best ways to integrate next-generation sequencing data and more traditional molecular markers in studies of genetic diversity.

AB Background
   Nearly a quarter of all avian species is either threatened or nearly threatened. Of these, 73 species are currently being rescued from going extinct in wildlife sanctuaries. One of the previously most critically-endangered is the crested ibis, Nipponia nippon. Once widespread across North-East Asia, by 1981 only seven individuals from two breeding pairs remained in the wild. The recovering crested ibis populations thus provide an excellent example for conservation genomics since every individual bird has been recruited for genomic and demographic studies.

   Using high-quality genome sequences of multiple crested ibis individuals, its thriving cohabitant, the little egret, Egretta garzetta, and the recently sequenced genomes of 41 other avian species that are under various degrees of survival threats, including the bald eagle, we carry out comparative analyses for genomic signatures of near extinction events in association with environmental and behavioral attributes of species. We confirm that both loss of genetic diversity and enrichment of deleterious mutations of protein-coding genes contribute to the major genetic defects of the endangered species. We further identify that genetic inbreeding and loss-of-function genes in the crested ibis may all constitute genetic susceptibility to other factors including long-term climate change, over-hunting, and agrochemical overuse. We also establish a genome-wide DNA identification platform for molecular breeding and conservation practices, to facilitate sustainable recovery of endangered species.
   Conclusions
   These findings demonstrate common genomic signatures of population decline across avian species and pave a way for further effort in saving endangered species and enhancing conservation genomic efforts.

AB Factor complexity is a characteristic of traffic crashes. This paper proposes a novel method, namely boosted regression trees (BRT), to investigate the complex and nonlinear relationships in high-variance traffic crash data. The Taiwanese 2004-2005 single-vehicle motorcycle crash data are used to demonstrate the utility of BRT. Traditional logistic regression and classification and regression tree (CART) models are also used to compare their estimation results and external validities. Both the in-sample cross-validation and out-of-sample validation results show that an increase in tree complexity provides improved, although declining, classification performance, indicating a limited factor complexity of single-vehicle motorcycle crashes. The effects of crucial variables including geographical, time, and sociodemographic factors explain some fatal crashes. Relatively unique fatal crashes are better approximated by interactive terms, especially combinations of behavioral factors. BRT models generally provide improved transferability than conventional logistic regression and CART models. This study also discusses the implications of the results for devising safety policies.

AB Increasingly, conservation professionals and regulatory agencies are attempting to identify ecological thresholds that define a point at which populations or communities demonstrate a marked response to human disturbance. Such thresholds may serve as the foundation for recognizing and then imposing limits on the levels of disturbance or types of land use. Although an intuitive concept, I argue that there are numerous scientific and practical limitations to applying ecological thresholds to conservation decision making. First, the concept is limited by the lack of a clear and universally accepted definition. Often, a threshold is defined as the point at which a population demonstrates a nonlinear ecological or biological response to some critical level of disturbance. Alternative definitions are premised on different trajectories of response or a direct recognition of conservation risks when prioritising socioeconomic values. Second, there is no clear or consistent method for identifying ecological thresholds including the appropriate response variables. Third, there is little evidence to suggest that ecological thresholds generalize to other species or populations: this limits the efficiency of thresholds as a decision making tool. Fourth, even where ecological thresholds are identified for the purpose of regulation or conservation planning, there are few examples of effective implementation. In comparison, regulatory limits are premised on the ecological response of populations to disturbance, but also consider the socioeconomic realities of conservation decision making including the risk associated with greater levels of development. Limits can be identified through participatory decision making processes that allow a consideration of potential future conditions within the context of current ecological and economic circumstances. When followed with long-term monitoring, regulatory limits can improve existing or provide new avenues for conservation planning and regulation. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Habitat requirements and landscape features can exert strong influences on the population structure of organisms. For aquatic organisms in particular, hydrologic requirements can dictate the extent of available habitat, and thus the degree of genetic connectivity among populations. We used a landscape genetics approach to evaluate hypotheses regarding the influence of landscape features on connectivity among populations of the giant water bug Abedus herberti (Hemiptera: Belostomatidae). Abedus herberti is restricted to naturally-fragmented, perennial stream habitats in arid regions of North America. This species is exceptional because it is flightless at all life stages. Thus, we hypothesized a high degree of population genetic structure in A. herberti due to hydrologic constraints on habitat and low dispersal ability of the organism. A total of 617 individuals were sampled from 20 populations across southeastern Arizona, USA and genotyped at 10 microsatellite loci. We used a Bayesian clustering method to delineate genetic groups among populations. To determine which of six landscape variables (representing hypotheses of landscape-level connectivity) has the strongest association with genetic connectivity in A. herberti, we used information-theoretic model selection. Strong population structure was evident among A. herberti populations, even at small spatial scales. At a larger scale, A. herberti populations were hierarchically structured across the study region, with groups of related populations generally occurring in the same mountain range, rather than in the same major watershed. Surprisingly, stream network connectivity was not important for explaining among-population patterns. Only the Curvature landscape variable was identified as having an association with genetic connectivity in A. herberti. The Curvature variable hypothesizes that gene flow tends to occur where local topography is concave, such as within stream drainages and dry gullies. Thus, our results suggest that population connectivity may depend on the shape of local overland topography rather than direct connectivity within stream drainage networks.

AB Evidence from numerous Pan-African savannah mammals indicates that open-habitat refugia existed in Africa during the Pleistocene, isolated by expanding tropical forests during warm and humid interglacial periods. However, comparative data from other taxonomic groups are currently lacking. We present a phylogeographic investigation of the African puff adder (Bitis arietans), a snake that occurs in open-habitat formations throughout sub-Saharan Africa. Multiple parapatric mitochondrial clades occur across the current distribution of B. arietans, including a widespread southern African clade that is subdivided into four separate clades. We investigated the historical processes responsible for generating these phylogeographic patterns in southern Africa using species distribution modelling and genetic approaches. Our results show that interior regions of South Africa became largely inhospitable for B. arietans during glacial maxima, whereas coastal and more northerly areas remained habitable. This corresponds well with the locations of refugia inferred from mitochondrial data using a continuous phylogeographic diffusion model. Analysis of data from five anonymous nuclear loci revealed broadly similar patterns to mtDNA. Secondary admixture was detected between previously isolated refugial populations. In some cases, this is limited to individuals occurring near mitochondrial clade contact zones, but in other cases, more extensive admixture is evident. Overall, our study reveals a complex history of refugial isolation and secondary expansion for puff adders and a mosaic of isolated refugia in southern Africa. We also identify key differences between the processes that drove isolation in B. arietans and those hypothesized for sympatric savannah mammals.

AB Background: The tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus, is one of the 100 most invasive species in the world and a vector of human diseases. In the last 30 years, it has spread from its native range in East Asia to Africa, Europe, and the Americas. Although this modern invasion has been the focus of many studies, the history of the species' native populations remains poorly understood. Here, we aimed to assess the role of Pleistocene climatic changes in shaping the current distribution of the species in its native range.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: We investigated the phylogeography, historical demography, and species distribution of Ae. albopictus native populations at the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Individuals from 16 localities from East Asia were analyzed for sequence variation at two mitochondrial genes. No phylogeographic structure was observed across the study area. Demographic analyses showed a signature of population expansion that started roughly 70,000 years BP. The occurrence of a continuous and climatically suitable area comprising Southeast China, Indochinese Peninsula, and Sundaland during LGM was indicated by species distribution modelling.
   Conclusions/Significance: Our results suggest an evolutionary scenario in which, during the last glacial phase, Ae. albopictus did not experience a fragmentation phase but rather persisted in interconnected populations and experienced demographic growth. The wide ecological flexibility of the species probably played a crucial role in its response to glacial-induced environmental changes. Currently, there is little information on the impact of Pleistocene climatic changes on animal species in East Asia. Most of the studies focused on forest-associated species and suggested cycles of glacial fragmentation and post-glacial expansion. The case of Ae. albopictus, which exhibits a pattern not previously observed in the study area, adds an important piece to our understanding of the Pleistocene history of East Asian biota.

AB Freshwater fish ecology has greatly benefited from the use of innovative tools such as stable isotope analysis to determine the ecological effects of non-native fishes. Stable isotope analyses are based on the predictable relationship between the isotope composition of a consumer and its prey, and have become increasingly popular amongst aquatic ecologists. In parallel, they have been implemented as a sensitive, cost-effective and temporally integrative tool to analyse the trophic interactions between native and non-native species, and to detect some subtle ecological effects of human activities, such as the introduction of non-native freshwater fish species. This review aimed to understand how stable isotope analyses have been used and how they have provided new insights into the ecological impacts of non-native freshwater fishes. Specifically, the published literature (45 articles) was reviewed to establish the current state-of-the-art. The use of stable isotope analyses in the field is still an emerging approach. The majority of studies were conducted on lentic ecosystems in North America targeting three main families of non-native fish species. Measurements were most commonly made with carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes using muscle samples. The most recent theoretical and methodological advances were illustrated by selecting some case studies conducted with different non-native species and biotic interactions. Finally, several recommendations for an optimised use of stable isotope analyses for freshwater ecological studies related to trophic interactions of non-native freshwater fish species were established.

AB Conservation genetics is expanding its research horizon with a genomic approach, by incorporating the modern techniques of next-generation sequencing (NGS). Application of NGS overcomes many limitations of conservation genetics. First, NGS allows for genome-wide screening of markers, which may lead to a more representative estimation of genetic variation within and between populations. Second, NGS allows for distinction between neutral and non-neutral markers. By screening populations on thousands of single nucleotide polymorphism markers, signals of selection can be found for some markers. Variation in these markers will give insight into functional rather than neutral genetic variation. Third, NGS facilitates the study of gene expression. Conservation genomics will increase our insight in how the environment and genes interact to affect phenotype and fitness. In addition, the NGS approach opens a way to study processes such as inbreeding depression and local adaptation mechanistically. Conservation genetics programs are directed to a fundamental understanding of the processes involved in conservation genetics and should preferably be started in species for which large databases on ecology, demography and genetics are available. Here, we describe and illustrate the connection between the application of NGS technologies and the research questions in conservation. The perspectives of conservation genomics programs are also discussed.

AB 1. Biological invasions are a major consequence of globalization and pose a significant threat to biodiversity. Because only a small fraction of introduced species become invasive, identification of those species most likely to become invasive after introduction is highly desirable to focus management efforts. The predictive potential of species-specific traits has been much investigated in plants and animals. However, despite the importance of fungi as a biological group and the potentially severe effects of pathogenic fungi on agrosystems and natural ecosystems, the specific identification of traits correlated with the invasion success of fungi has not been attempted previously.
   2. We addressed this question by constructing an ad hoc data set including invasive and non-invasive species of forest pathogenic fungi introduced into Europe. Data were analysed with a machine learning method based on classification trees (Random Forest). The performance of the classification rule based on species traits was compared with that of several random decision rules, and the principal trait predictors associated with invasive species were identified.
   3. Invasion success was more accurately predicted by the classification rule including biological traits than by random decision rules. The effect of species traits was maintained when confounding variables linked to residence time and habitat availability were included. The selected traits were unlikely to be affected by a phylogenetic bias as invasive and non-invasive species were evenly distributed in fungal clades.
   4. The species-level predictors identified as useful for distinguishing between invasive and non-invasive species were traits related to long-distance dispersal, sexual reproduction (in addition to asexual reproduction), spore shape and size, number of cells in spores, optimal temperature for growth and parasitic specialization (host range and infected organs).
   5. Synthesis and applications. This study demonstrates that some species-level traits are predictors of invasion success for forest pathogenic fungi in Europe. These traits could be used to refine current pest risk assessment (PRA) schemes. Our results suggest that current schemes, which are mostly based on sequential questionnaires, could be improved by taking into account trait interactions or combinations. More generally, our results confirm the interest of machine learning methods, such as Random Forest, for species classification in ecology.

AB Urban areas are species-rich ecosystems. The question remains, however, whether urban species constitute a unique community, and thus add value to landscape biodiversity, or whether they are just a mixture of species from surrounding ecosystems. In this study, the occurrence and abundance of arthropods were analysed according to trophic guilds (Cerambycidae and Buprestidae as xylophagous species. Apiformes as pollinators, Neuroptera as flying predators. Araneae and Carabidae as surface-dwelling predators) in urban, agricultural and forest ecosystems in Switzerland. To assess the likely origin of arthropod fauna in Swiss cities, we identified character species (regular and constant occurrence) for ecosystems and performed ordination and cluster analyses. In total, we studied 10,034 specimens from 497 species and found that 13% of all species and 10% of the character species were predominately found in the urban ecosystems. Community analyses showed that the three ecosystems harbour distinct species assemblages. While communities at forest sites are quite dissimilar from those at urban and agricultural sites, these latter share more than one third of all character species, which indicates either that agricultural areas function as source habitats for urban communities or that agricultural species have survived urbanisation in situ. Overall, our study identified a distinct urban arthropod community that enriches landscape (gamma) diversity in Switzerland. Urban sites may provide novel habitats for species of former extensive agriculture, or species otherwise not, or scarcely, occurring in the region. The present study illuminates the value of urban arthropods for overall biodiversity which should be incorporated in planning decisions. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We present a comparative network-theoretic analysis of the two largest global transportation networks: the worldwide air-transportation network (WAN) and the global cargo-ship network (GCSN). We show that both networks exhibit surprising statistical similarities despite significant differences in topology and connectivity. Both networks exhibit a discontinuity in node and link betweenness distributions which implies that these networks naturally segregate into two different classes of nodes and links. We introduce a technique based on effective distances, shortest paths and shortest path trees for strongly weighted symmetric networks and show that in a shortest path tree representation the most significant features of both networks can be readily seen. We show that effective shortest path distance, unlike conventional geographic distance measures, strongly correlates with node centrality measures. Using the new technique we show that network resilience can be investigated more precisely than with contemporary techniques that are based on percolation theory. We extract a functional relationship between node characteristics and resilience to network disruption. Finally we discuss the results, their implications and conclude that dynamic processes that evolve on both networks are expected to share universal dynamic characteristics.

AB Resolving the phylogenetic relationships among birds is a classical problem in systematics, and this is particularly so when it comes to understanding the relationships among Neoaves. Previous phylogenetic inference of birds has been limited to mitochondrial genomes or a few nuclear genes. Here, we apply deep brain transcriptome sequencing of nine bird species (several passerines, hummingbirds, dove, parrot, and emu), using next-generation sequencing technology to understand features of transcriptome evolution in birds and how this affects phylogenetic inference, and combine with data from two bird species using first generation technology. The phylogenomic data matrix comprises 1,995 genes and a total of 0.77 Mb of exonic sequence. First, we find an unexpected heterogeneity in the evolution of base composition among avian lineages. There is a pronounced increase in guanine + cytosine (GC) content in the third codon position in several independent lineages, with the strongest effect seen in passerines. Second, we evaluate the effect of GC content variation on phylogenetic reconstruction. We find important inconsistencies between the topologies obtained with or without taking GC variation into account, each supporting different conclusions of past studies and also influencing hypotheses on the evolution of the trait of vocal learning. Third, we demonstrate a link between GC content evolution and recombination rate and, focusing on the zebra finch lineage, find that recombination seems to drive GC content. Although we cannot reveal the causal relationships, this observation is consistent with the model of GC-biased gene conversion. Finally, we use this unparalleled amount of avian sequence data to study the rate of molecular evolution, calibrated by fossil evidence and augmented with data from alligator transcriptome sequencing. There is a 2- to 3-fold variation in substitution rate among lineages with passerines being the most rapidly evolving and ratites the slowest. This study illustrates the potential of next-generation sequencing for phylogenomic studies but also the pitfalls when using genome-wide data with heterogeneous base composition.

AB Question: How can nearest-neighbour (NN) imputation be used to develop maps of multiple species and plant communities?
   Location: Western and central Oregon, USA, but methods are applicable anywhere.
   Methods: We demonstrate NN imputation by mapping woody plant communities for > 100 000 km(2) of diverse forests and woodlands. Species abundances on similar to 25 000 plots were related to spatial predictors (rasters) describing climate, topography, soil and geographic location using constrained ordination (CCA). Species data from the nearest plot in multi-dimensional CCA space were imputed to each map pixel. Maps of multiple individual species and community types were constructed from the single imputed surface. We computed a variety of diagnostics to characterize different qualities of the imputed (mapped) community data.
   Results: Community composition gradients were strongly associated with climate and elevation, and less so with topography and soil. Accuracy of the imputation model for presence/absence of 150 species varied widely (kappa 0.00 to 0.80). Omission error rates were higher than commission rates due to low species prevalence, and areal representation of species was only slightly inflated. A map of 78 community types was 41% correct and 78% fuzzy correct. Errors of omission and commission were balanced, and areal representation of both rare and abundant communities was accurate. Map accuracy may be lower for some species than with other methods, but areal representation of species and communities across large landscapes is preserved. Because imputed vegetation surfaces are developed for all species simultaneously, map units contain suites of species known to co-occur in nature. Maps of individual species, and of community types derived from them, will be internally consistent at map locations.
   Conclusions: NN imputation is a useful modelling approach where maps of multiple species and plant communities are needed, such as in natural resource management and conservation planning or models that project landscape change under alternative disturbance or climate scenarios. More research is needed to evaluate other ordination methods for NN imputation of plant communities.

AB Root distribution of field grown potatoes (cv. Folva) was studied in 4.32 m(2) lysimeters and subjected to full (FI), deficit (DI), and partial root-zone drying (PRD) irrigation strategies. Drip irrigation was applied for all irrigations. Irrigations were run in three different soils: coarse sand, loamy sand, and sandy loam. Irrigation treatments started after tuber bulking and lasted until final harvest with PRD and DI receiving 65% of FI. Potatoes irrigated with water-saving irrigation techniques (PRD and DI) did not show statistically different dry root mass and root length density (RLD, cm root per cm(3) soil) compared with root development in fully irrigated (FI) potatoes. Highest RLD existed in the top 30-40 cm of the ridge below which it decreased sharply. The RLD was distributed homogenously along the ridge and furrow but heterogeneously across the ridge and furrow with highest root density in the furrow. Most roots accumulated in the surface layers of coarse sand as compared to the other soil types. In the deep soil profile (30-70 cm) a higher root density was found in loamy sand compared with the sandy loam and coarse sand. Approximately twice the amounts of roots were found below the furrows compared with the corresponding layers below the ridges. The RLD values in the soil profile of the ridges and the furrows followed the Gerwitz and Page model: RLD = alpha x exp(-beta x z). The highest value of surface root density (alpha) and rate of change in density (beta) was found in coarse sand while the lowest values of alpha and beta were found in the sandy loam and loamy sand. The model estimated the effective rooting depth in coarse sand and sandy loam quite well but did slightly overestimate it in the loamy sand. Statistical analysis showed that one alpha and beta value can be used for each soil irrespective of the irrigation treatment. Thus, the effective rooting depths corresponding to root length densities of 0.1 and 0.25 cm cm(-3) for sandy loam, loamy sand, and coarse sand soils were 99, 141, and 94 cm, and 80, 115, and 78 cm, respectively, calculated from top of the ridge. The findings of this study can be used in practice for efficient use of water and nutrients in the field. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Managing seed movement is an important component of forest resource management to minimize maladaptation of planting stock in forest plantations. Here, we describe a new approach to analyze geographic patterns of adaptive and neutral genetic variation in forest trees and to link this genetic information to geographic variables for the delineation of seed zones and the development of seed transfer guidelines. We apply multivariate regression trees to partition genetic variation, using a set of environmental or geographic predictor variables as partitioning criteria in a series of dichotomous splits of the genetic dataset. The method can be applied to any type of genetic data (growth, adaptive, or marker traits) and can simultaneously evaluate multiple traits observed over several environments. The predictor variables can be categorical (e.g., ecosystem of seed source), continuous (e.g., geographic or climate variables), or a combination of both. Different sets of predictor variables can be used for different purposes: In two case studies for aspen and red alder, we show (1) how latitude, longitude, and elevation of seed sources in a provenance trial can be used to develop simple seed transfer guidelines; (2) how ecosystem classes and elevation as predictor variables can be used to delineate seed zones and breeding regions; and (3) how climate variables as predictors can reveal adaptation of genotypes to the environments in which they occur. Partitioning of genetic variation appears very robust regarding the choice of predictor variables, and we find that the method is a powerful aid for interpreting complex genetic datasets.

AB Human-induced land use changes are causing extensive habitat fragmentation. As a result, many species are not able to shift their ranges in response to climate change and will likely need to adapt in situ to changing climate conditions. Consequently, a prudent strategy to maintain the ability of populations to adapt is to focus conservation efforts on areas where levels of intraspecific variation are high. By doing so, the potential for an evolutionary response to environmental change is maximized. Here, we use modeling approaches in conjunction with environmental variables to model species distributions and patterns of genetic and morphological variation in seven Ecuadorian amphibian, bird, and mammal species. We then used reserve selection software to prioritize areas for conservation based on intraspecific variation or species-level diversity. Reserves selected using species richness and complementarity showed little overlap with those based on genetic and morphological variation. Priority areas for intraspecific variation were mainly located along the slopes of the Andes and were largely concordant among species, but were not well represented in existing reserves. Our results imply that in order to maximize representation of intraspecific variation in reserves, genetic and morphological variation should be included in conservation prioritization.

AB The common carp Cyprinus carpio, a worldwide introduced benthivorous fish, has been implicated in the degradation of native environments through initiation of a shift to a phytoplankton-dominated turbid state, which is associated with dramatic biodiversity loss. This study combined surveys of ponds containing either low total biomass of small-sized carp or high densities of large-sized carp with an enclosure/exclosure experiment, in order to quantify the direct (trophic) and indirect (via habitat deterioration) impacts of carp on pond communities. High-density ponds supported substantially lower biodiversity and were more turbid than low-density ponds. The subsequent field experiment examined the effects of carp presence/absence and of clear-water versus moderately turbid conditions mediated by carp on the survival to metamorphosis of larval anurans Pelobates fuscus and Hyla arborea, on Zygoptera and Anisoptera densities, and on the biomass of submerged macrophytes. The presence of enclosed one-year old carp resulted in the complete elimination of larval anurans and the absence of Odonata. The effects of the habitat conditions were not significant, apart from better survival of P. fuscus in the moderately turbid carp exclosures than in clear water. Submerged plants were more abundant in clear-water than in turbid treatments, with a negligible effect of enclosures/exclosures. These results suggest that carp predation and related effects may be primarily responsible for animal diversity loss in invaded communities, as they may act prior to, or independent of, the ecosystem switch to a turbid phase.

AB P>1. In the prevailing context of concerns over climate change and its potential impacts on ecosystems, evaluating ecological consequences of climatic forcing has become a critical issue.
   2. Historical data on the abundance of organisms have been extensively used to characterize the ecological effects of climatic forcing through specific weather and/or climatic variables, with most of the studies confined to single population models.
   3. However, population responses to environmental fluctuations typically depend upon positive and negative feedbacks induced by interactions with other species. It is therefore important to integrate the insights gained from single population approaches into a multispecies perspective.
   4. Here we combine the hierarchical Bayesian modelling approach with the state-space formulation to extend the scope of previously proposed models of population dynamics under climatic forcing to multi-species systems.
   5. We use our model to analyse long-term macro-moth (Lepidoptera) community data from the Rothamsted Insect Survey network in the UK, using winter rainfall and winter temperature as environmental covariates.
   6. The effects of the two weather variables were consistent across species, being negative for winter rainfall and positive for winter temperature. The two weather variables jointly explained 15-40% of the total environmental variation affecting the dynamics of individual species, and could explain up to 90% of covariances in species dynamics.
   7. The contribution of interspecific interactions to community-level variation was found to be weak compared to the contributions of environmental forcing and intraspecific interactions.

AB Species that inhabit naturally fragmented environments are expected to be spatially structured and exhibit reduced genetic diversity at the periphery of their range. Patterns of differentiation may also reflect historical processes such as recolonization from glacial refugia. We examined the relative importance of these factors in shaping the spatial patterns of genetic differentiation across the range of an alpine specialist, the North American mountain goat (Oreamnos americanus). Contrary to fossil evidence that suggests a single southern refugium, we detected evidence for additional refugia in northern British Columbia and the Alaskan coast using both mitochondrial and microsatellite DNA. A core area of elevated genetic diversity characterized both regions, and molecular dating suggested a recent Pleistocene split was followed by demographic expansion. Across their range, mountain goats were highly genetically structured and displayed the expected pattern of declining diversity toward the periphery. Gene flow was high within contiguous mountain ranges, but cross-assignments paradoxically suggest that long-distance contemporary dispersal movements are not uncommon. These results improve our understanding of how historical vicariance and contemporary fragmentation influence population differentiation, and have implications for conserving the adaptive potential of alpine populations and habitat.

AB Gully erosion represents one of the greatest threats to agricultural watersheds around the world and this is exacerbated with continual changes to land practices and changing climatic condition at a temporal scale Catchment based models which Include gully erosion have received increased attention in recent years due to the impact of mill), erosion on downstream water quality These types of models take gully erosion calculated via a deterministic model at a particular spatial location, along. with other measures of erosion to provide an end-of-catchment load Although seen as a major contributor to erosion in this type of modelling framework. the error surrounding the mill), erosion calculation is ignored in the sediment model We propose a methodology that investigates the error in the gully erosion model The methodology uses Random Forests to predict gully density and its associated prediction error across a catchment using environmental variables, which are then incorporated into the gully erosion model We demonstrate the approach using the Burdekin catchment in Queensland. Australia, where only a very small proportion of gullies (similar to 0.88%) have been mapped Our results cast doubt in the predictive ability of models of sediment transportation that use gully erosion where the error is estimated high Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd

AB Vegetation cover may affect weed seed predation by modifying the habitat quality for predatory organisms. Post-dispersal weed seed predation was measured by placing 'seed cards' in two perennial crops (alfalfa, cocksfoot) with and without crop cutting and in plots with bare soil. Each treatment was repeated four times in a randomized complete block design. Vegetation cover was measured by canopy light interception. Predation trials lasted two weeks and were repeated three times. Seed predation rates varied among three weed species (highest for Viola arvensis, intermediate for Alopecurus myosuroides, lowest for Sinapis arvensis). Vertebrate exclusion cages (12 mm x 12 mm openings) strongly reduced seed predation rates. Positive relationships were observed between vegetation cover and seed predation rates by both vertebrates and invertebrates for all weed species and trials, except when overall predation rates were very low. Predation rates were highest in uncut alfalfa, lowest on bare soil, but 16-64% of this variation could equally be explained by vegetation cover. The factorial design indicated that cutting had a stronger impact than crop species (legume or grass). Results suggest that weed seed predation may be enhanced by maintaining a high and temporally extended vegetation cover. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Ponds are among the most diverse and yet threatened components of freshwater biodiversity. The conservation of ponds would greatly benefit from the identification of surrogate taxa in preliminary assessments aimed at detecting ponds of potentially high biodiversity value. Here, we used predictive co-correspondence analysis (Co-CA) to quantify the strength of plant species composition and plant community types in predicting multivariate patterns in water beetle assemblages, based on data from 54 farmland ponds in Ireland. The predictive accuracy of a number of environmental variables as well as that of plant diversity (species richness and evenness) was calculated using predictive canonical correspondence analysis (CCA-PLS). The study ponds supported over 30% of the Irish water beetle fauna (76 species), with five species having some form of IUCN Red List Status in Ireland, as well as 67 wetland plant species, including a nationally rare one. Co-CA showed that plant species composition had a positive predictive accuracy, which was significantly higher compared to that of data at the plant community type level. Although environmental variables showed a higher predictive capacity compared to that of plant species composition, the difference was not significant. Explanatory CCA analyses showed that plants and beetles both responded to the same subset of environmental conditions, which explained approximately 18% of the variation in both plant and beetle species composition. Regional differences as well as permanency, substratum, and grazing intensity affected the composition of both plant and beetle assemblages. These findings have important implications in conservation planning. First, wetland plants can be effectively used as a surrogate taxon in the identification of conservation-priority ponds. Second, conservation strategies aimed at maintaining and enhancing pond biodiversity should be based on considerations on plant species composition. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Studies on soil respiration in mountain forests are rather scarce compared to their broad distribution. Therefore, we investigated daily, seasonal and annual soil respiration rates in a mixed forest (Lageren), located at about 700 m in the Swiss Jura mountains, during 2 years (2006 and 2007). Soil respiration (SR) was measured continuously with high temporal resolution (half-hourly) at one single point (SRautomated) and periodically with high spatial resolution (SRmanual) at 16 plots within the study site. Both, SRautomated and SRmanual showed a similar seasonal cycle. SR strongly depended on soil temperature in 2007 (R (2) = 0.82-0.92), but less so in 2006 (R (2) = 0.56-0.76) when SR was water limited during a summer drought. Including soil moisture improved the fit of the 2006 model significantly (R (2) = 0.78-0.97). Total annual SR for the study site was estimated as 869 g C m(-2) year(-1) for 2006 and as 907 g C m(-2) year(-1) for 2007 (uncertainty < 10% at the 95% confidence interval, determined by bootstrapping). Selected environmental conditions were assessed in more detail: (1) Rapid, but contrasting changes of SR were found after summer rainfall. Depending on soil moisture at pre-rain conditions, summer rain could either cause a pulse of CO2 from the soil or an abrupt decrease of SRautomated due to water logging of soil pores. (2) Two contrasting winter seasons resulted in SR being about 60-70% (31.2-44.6 g C m(-2)) higher during a mild winter (2007) compared to a harsh winter (2006). (3) Analysing SR for selected periods on a diurnal scale revealed a counter-clockwise hysteresis with soil surface temperatures. This indication of a time-lagged response of SR to temperature was further supported by a very strong relationship (R (2) = 0.86-0.90) of SR to soil temperature with a time-lag of 2-4 h.

AB Although it is known that most HIV-1 infections worldwide result from exposure to virus in semen, it has not yet been established whether transmitted strains originate as RNA virions in seminal plasma or as integrated proviral DNA in infected seminal leukocytes. We present phylogenetic evidence that among six transmitting pairs of men who have sex with men, blood plasma virus in the recipient is consistently more closely related to the seminal plasma virus in the source. All sequences were subtype B, and the env C2V3 of transmitted variants tended to have higher mean isoelectric points, contain potential N-linked glycosylation sites, and favor CCR5 co-receptor usage. A statistically robust phylogenetically corrected analysis did not detect genetic signatures reliably associated with transmission, but further investigation of larger samples of transmitting pairs holds promise for determining which structural and genetic features of viral genomes are associated with

AB Estuarine fish assemblages are subject to a great environmental variability that largely depends on both upstream fluvial and downstream marine influences. From this ecohydrological view, our study introduces a macroecological approach aiming to identify the main environmental factors that structure fish assemblages among European tidal estuaries. The present paper focuses on the influence of large-scale environmental gradients on estuarine fish species richness. The environment of 135 North-eastern Atlantic estuaries from Portugal to Scotland was characterised by various descriptors especially related to hydromorphology. Major environmental trends among estuaries were underlined using multivariate techniques and cluster analyses applied to abiotic data. In particular, an integrative system size covariate was derived from a principal component analysis. Factors explaining patterns of species richness at different scales from local habitat to regional features were highlighted. Based on generalised linear models, the estuarine system size, and more particularly the entrance width, and also the continental shelf width were identified as the best explanatory variables of estuarine fish species richness at a large-scale. Our approach provides a standardized method to estimate the relationship between fish assemblages and environmental factors. This constitutes a first step in assessing estuarine ecological status and studying the effects of additional factors such as anthropogenic disturbances. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Streams experience frequent natural disturbance and are undergoing considerable anthropogenic disturbance due to dam construction and water diversion. Disturbance is known to impact community structure, but its effect on food chain length is still a matter of considerable debate. Theoretical models show that longer food chains are less resilient to disturbance, so food chain length is predicted to be shorter following a disturbance event. Here we experimentally test the effect of disturbance on food chain length in streams by diverting stream flow. We found that our experimental low-flow disturbance did not alter food chain length. We did see an effect on body-size structure in our food webs suggesting that food chain length may be an insensitive indicator of disturbance. We suggest that habitat heterogeneity and food web complexity buffer the effect of disturbance on food chain length. The theoretical predictions of disturbance on food chain length are only likely to be seen in homogeneous systems that closely approximate the linear food chains the models are based upon.

AB Reliable assessments of how human activities will affect wildlife populations are essential for making scientifically defensible resource management decisions. A principle challenge of predicting effects of proposed management, development, or conservation actions is the need to incorporate multiple biotic and abiotic factors, including land-use and climate change, that interact to affect wildlife habitat and populations through time. Here we demonstrate how models of land-use, climate change, and other dynamic factors can be integrated into a coherent framework for predicting wildlife population trends. Our framework starts with land-use and climate change models developed for a region of interest. Vegetation changes through time under alternative future scenarios are predicted using an individual-based plant community model. These predictions are combined with spatially explicit animal habitat models to map changes in the distribution and quality of wildlife habitat expected under the various scenarios. Animal population responses to habitat changes and other factors are then projected using a flexible, individual-based animal population model.
   As an example application, we simulated animal population trends under three future land-use scenarios and four climate change scenarios in the Cascade Range of western Oregon. We chose two birds with contrasting habitat preferences for our simulations: winter wrens (Troglodytes troglodytes), which are most abundant in mature conifer forests, and song sparrows (Melospiza melodia), which prefer more open, shrubby habitats. We used climate and land-use predictions from previously published studies, as well as previously published predictions of vegetation responses using FORCLIM, an individual-based forest dynamics simulator. Vegetation predictions were integrated with other factors in PATCH, a spatially explicit, individual-based animal population simulator. Through incorporating effects of landscape history and limited dispersal, our framework predicted population changes that typically exceeded those expected based on changes in mean habitat suitability alone. Although land-use had greater impacts on habitat quality than did climate change in our simulations, we found that small changes in vital rates resulting from climate change or other stressors can have large consequences for population trajectories. The ability to integrate bottom-up demographic processes like these with top-down constraints imposed by climate and land-use in a dynamic modeling environment is a key advantage of our approach. The resulting framework should allow researchers to synthesize existing empirical evidence, and to explore complex interactions that are difficult or impossible to capture through piecemeal modeling approaches.

AB Climate driven and other changes in landscape structure and texture, plus more general factors, may create favourable ecological niches for emerging diseases. Abiotic factors impact on vectors, reservoirs and pathogen bionomics and their ability to establish in new ecosystems. Changes in climatic patterns and in seasonal conditions may affect disease behaviour in terms of spread pattern, diffusion range, amplification and persistence in novel habitats. Pathogen invasion may result in the emergence of novel disease complexes, presenting major challenges for the sustainability of future animal agriculture at the global level. In this paper, some of the ecological mechanisms underlying the impact of climatic change on disease transmission and disease spread are further described. Potential effects of different climatic variables on pathogens and host population dynamics and distribution are complex to assess, and different approaches are used to describe the underlying epidemiological processes and the availability of ecological niches for pathogens and vectors. The invasion process can disrupt the long-term co-evolution of species. Pathogens adhering to an r-type strategy (e.g. RNA viruses) may be more inclined to encroach on a novel niche resulting from climate change. However, even when linkage between disease dynamics and climate change are relatively strong, there are other factors changing disease behaviour, and these should be accounted for as well. Overall vulnerability of a given ecosystem is a key variable in this regard. The impact of climate-driven changes varies in different parts of the world and in the different agro-climatic zones. Perhaps priority should go to those geographical areas where the integrity of the ecosystem is most severely affected and the adaptability, in terms of robustness and sustainability of response, relatively low.

AB For the Argentine ant Linepithema humile, bioclimatic models often predict narrower optimal temperature ranges than those suggested by behavioural and physiological studies. Although water balance characteristics of workers of this species have been thoroughly studied, gaps exist in current understanding of its thermal limits. We investigated critical thermal minima and maxima and upper and lower lethal limits following acclimation to four temperatures (15, 20, 25, 30 C; 12L:12D photoperiod) in adult workers of the Argentine ant, L. humile, collected from Stellenbosch, South Africa. At an ecologically relevant rate of temperature change of 0.05 degrees C min(-1), CTMax varied between 38 and 40 degrees C, and CTMin varied between 0 and 0.8 degrees C. In both cases the response to acclimation was weak. A significant time by exposure temperature interaction was found for upper and lower lethal limits, with a more pronounced effect of acclimation at longer exposure durations. Upper lethal limits varied whilst lower lethal limits varied between -4 and -10.5 degrees C, with an acclimation between 37 and 44 degrees C, effect more pronounced for upper than lower lethal limits. A thermal envelope for workers of the Argentine ant is provided, demonstrating that upper thermal limits do likely contribute to distributional limits, but that lower lethal limits and limits to activity likely do not, or at least for workers who are not exposed simultaneously to the demands of load carriage and successful foraging behaviour.

AB It has proven difficult, when focused only on biological determinants, to explain why some plant species become naturalized in or invade new locations, whereas others fail. We analyzed the invasion of Trifolium (true clover) species into New Zealand, assessing a range of human, biogeographic, and biological influences at three key invasion stages: introduction, naturalization, and spread. We used sparse principal component analysis (SPCA) to define suites of related attributes and aggregated boosted trees to model relationships with invasion outcomes. Human and biogeographic attributes were strongly associated with success at all stages. Whereas biogeographic attributes, notably large native range, were consistently associated with success, different human factors appeared to favor success at different stages, such as presence in early trade/immigration hotspots (introduction), intentional large-scale planting (naturalization), and frequent presence as a seed contaminant (relative spread rate). Biological traits were less strongly associated with success for introduction and spread and little if at all for naturalization; we found that tall perennials with long flowering periods were more frequently selected for introduction, whereas species With extended flowering in New Zealand spread more rapidly. In addition to causal relationships, the importance of human factors may reflect indirect associations, including ecological traits associated with both human use and invasion. Nevertheless, our results highlight key roles that humans can play in facilitating plant invasion via two pathways: (i) commercial introduction leading to widespread planting and concomitant naturalization and spread and (h) unintentional introduction and spread of species associated with human activities, such as seed contaminants.

AB Unlike Oceanic islands, the islands of the Arctic Sea are not completely isolated from migration by terrestrial vertebrates. The pack ice connects many Arctic Sea islands to the mainland during winter months. The Arctic fox (Alopex lagopus), which has a circumpolar distribution, populates numerous islands in the Arctic Sea. In this study, we used genetic data from 20 different populations, spanning the entire distribution of the Arctic fox, to identify barriers to dispersal. Specifically, we considered geographical distance, occurrence of sea ice, winter temperature, ecotype, and the presence of red fox and polar bear as nonexclusive factors that influence the dispersal behaviour of individuals. Using distance-based redundancy analysis and the BIOENV procedure, we showed that occurrence of sea ice is the key predictor and explained 40-60% of the genetic distance among populations. In addition, our analysis identified the Commander and Pribilof Islands Arctic populations as genetically unique suggesting they deserve special attention from a conservation perspective.

AB 1. Flow permanence (the proportion of time that flowing water is present) strongly influences benthic invertebrate assemblages in ephemeral and intermittent river reaches. Effects of varying flow permanence on hyporheic invertebrate assemblages are not well understood, and have not previously been studied at large spatial scales.
   2. We used a 52-km long flow-permanence gradient in the alluvial Selwyn River, New Zealand to assess hyporheic assemblage responses to variation in flow permanence and surface-subsurface exchange. The Selwyn mainstem consists of perennial and temporary reaches embedded in longer downwelling (losing) and upwelling (gaining) sections.
   3. We predicted that hyporheic invertebrate diversity, density and assemblage stability would increase with increasing flow permanence. We further predicted that assemblage structure would be influenced by the relative contribution of downwelling and upwelling water at the reach-scale.
   4. Hyporheic invertebrates were collected at 15 river cross-sections over a 13-month period. As predicted, hyporheic taxon richness, density and assemblage stability varied directly with flow permanence. The distribution of taxa along the flow permanence gradient appeared to be related to desiccation resistance. However, it is possible that proximity to colonist sources also contributed to distribution patterns.
   5. Taxon richness was significantly higher at sites in the gaining section compared with the losing section. Sites with high flow permanence in the gaining and losing sections supported distinct hyporheic assemblages, characterised by amphipods and isopods in the gaining section, and ostracods, Hydra sp. and the mayfly Deleatidium spp. in the losing section.
   6. Results of the study suggest an expansion of the scope of the Hyporheic Corridor Concept to include large hyporheic flowpaths associated with unbounded alluvial plains rivers. Hyporheic assemblages in alluvial rivers are strongly influenced by large-scale flow permanence gradients, large-scale surface water-groundwater exchange, and their interactions.

ID SPRING MIGRATION; FARMLAND BIRDS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; ARRIVAL DATE;
   CONSEQUENCES; TRENDS; AGE
AB The phenology of avian migration appears to be changing in response to climate change. Seemingly contradictory differences in the timing of these annual cycles have been reported in published studies. We show that differences between studies in the choice of songbird species, as well as in the measurements of migration phenology, can explain most of the reported differences. Furthermore, while earlier spring arrival is evident across these studies, trends in timing of departure show large variation between species and according to individual timing of migration (early-arriving vs. late-departing individuals). Much of the variation in departure between species could be explained by each species' migratory status. We present a detailed analysis of migrants recorded at a Danish migration site, and reveal that although shifts in migration timing can be demonstrated for almost all species, these shifts are either most pronounced in the early arriving/late departing individuals or the changes are similar. Thus most individuals do not seem to change their breeding-area residence time (BART). As BART is likely to reflect ecologically important factors, e.g. number of clutches, we expect that only small effects have been exerted on the breeding ecology of the studied species in the time period investigated.

AB Saproxylic insects, a functional group dominated by beetles, are dependent on dead or moribund trees as habitat elements.
   Although there are few studies of saproxylic insects from the North American boreal zone, European studies demonstrate that forest harvest can lead to a biologically significant decrease in saproxylic beetle diversity.
   We studied saproxylic beetles in the North American boreal mixedwood forest using flight intercept traps established on naturally dead and girdled trembling aspen and spruce trees along a successional gradient of undisturbed stands from deciduous to coniferous overstory trees.
   Composition and diversity of beetle assemblages differed among forest successional types.
   Snag age class was an important determinant of composition for saproxylic beetle assemblages.
   Multivariate regression analysis of these data indicated that saproxylic beetles are responding to changes in coarse woody debris, and not to the relative densities of canopy tree species, although these variables are strongly correlated.
   Coarse woody debris management should be a primary concern in forest management plans seeking to conserve saproxylic organisms and the critical ecosystem functions (i.e. nutrient cycling) in which they participate.

AB Dispersal is a major factor regulating the number of coexisting species, but the relationship between species diversity and ecosystem processes has mainly been analysed for communities closed to dispersal. We experimentally investigated how initial local diversity and dispersal frequency affect local diversity and biomass production in open benthic microalgal metacommunities. Final local species richness and local biomass production were strongly influenced by dispersal frequency but not by initial local diversity. Both final local richness and final local biomass showed a hump-shaped pattern with increasing dispersal frequency, with a maximum at intermediate dispersal frequencies. Consequently, final local biomass increased linearly with increasing final richness. We conclude that the general relationship between richness and ecosystem functioning remains valid in open systems, but the maintenance of ecosystem processes significantly depends on the effects of dispersal on species richness and local interactions.

AB Tomato rooting patterns, yield and fruit quality were evaluated in a field trial where three irrigation regimes [0.6 ( DI), 0.9 (DII) and 1.2 ETc (DIII)] and three drip irrigation depths [ surface (R0), subsurface at 20 cm depth ( RI) and subsurface at 40 cm depth (RII)] were imposed following a split-plot experimental design, with four replications. The behaviour of the root system in response to the irrigation treatments was evaluated using minirhizotrons installed between two plants, near the plant row. Root-length intensity (L-a) - length of the root per unit of minirhizotron surface area ( cm cm(-2)) - was measured at four crop stages. For all sampling dates, none of the factors studied were found to influence L-a or rooting depth significantly or the interaction between treatments. For all treatments most of the root system was concentrated in the top 40 cm of the soil profile, where the root-length density ranged from 0.5 cm cm(-3) to 1.4 cm cm(-3). The response of tomato fruits to an increase in the water applied was similar in quantitative and qualitative terms for the different drip irrigation depths. Water applied by drip irrigation had the opposite effect on commercial yield ( t ha(-1)) and soluble solids (degrees Brix) ( r= - 0.82, P< 0.001), however, yield in terms of total soluble solids ( t ha(-1)) was the same for the 0.9 and 1.2 ETc. The increase in commercial yield can be described by the equation dcommercial yield = 91.106 (% ETc2) + 264.34d% ETc) - 55.973; R-2 = 0, 63, P<0.001).

AB Variability of leaf traits related to photosynthesis was assessed in seedlings from 14 tree species growing in the tropical rain forest of French Guiana. Leaf photosynthetic capacity (maximum rate of carboxylation and maximum rate of electron transport) was estimated by fitting a biochemical model of photosynthesis to response curves of net CO2 assimilation rate versus intercellular CO2 mole fraction. Leaf morphology described by leaf mass per unit leaf area (LMA), density and thickness, as well as area- and mass-based nitrogen (N) and carbon (C) concentrations, were recorded on the same leaves. Large interspecific variability was detected in photosynthetic capacity as well as in leaf structure and leaf N and C concentrations. No correlation was found between leaf thickness and density. The correlations between area- and mass-based leaf N concentration and photosynthetic capacity were poor. Conversely, the species differed greatly in relative N allocation to carboxylation and bioenergetics. Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed that, of the recorded traits, only the computed fraction of total leaf N invested in photosynthesis was tightly correlated to photosynthetic capacity. We also used PCA to test to what extent species with similar shade tolerances displayed converging leaf traits related to photosynthesis. No clear-cut ranking could be detected among the shade-tolerant groups, as confirmed by a one-way ANOVA. We conclude that the large interspecific diversity in photosynthetic capacity was mostly explained by differences in the relative allocation of N to photosynthesis and not by leaf N concentration, and that leaf traits related to photosynthetic capacity did not discriminate shade-tolerance ranking of these tropical tree species.

AB While males gain obvious direct advantages from multiple mating, the reproductive capacity of females is more constrained. The reason why polyandry evolved in females is therefore open to many conjectures. One hypothesis postulates that females gain indirect benefits by increasing the probability of siring young from high quality males. To explore this hypothesis, we used the natural variation of the reproductive value that males and females undergo through age. The age-related variation of phenotypic performance might then induce variations in mating strategies in males and females. Using the common lizard (Lacerta vivipara) as our model system, we showed that reproductive immaturity and senescence created variability in both male and female reproductive success (including survival of offspring). Consistent with theory, males at their best-performing phenotype adopted a polygynous strategy. These males were of an intermediate age and they produced offspring of higher viability than younger and older males. In contrast, females at their best performing phenotype, also of an intermediate age, were less polyandrous than other less-performing females. Middle-aged females tended to mate with males of an intermediate age and produced litters with higher viability independently from their reproductive strategy. Males of an intermediate age enhanced their fitness by additional matings with young or old females. Young and old females increased their fitness by being more polyandrous. Polyandry therefore appears as means to seek for good males. A positive correlation between males and their partners' fitness disagree with the idea that polyandry is the result of a sexual conflict in this species.

AB The construction and maintenance of roads in the Australian Alps has caused profound disturbance to the natural existing soil and vegetation, as well as the introduction and proliferation of exotic plant species. This study examined three ecotypes associated with roads. These ecotypes were tested for differences in soil characteristics and occurrence of different plant species. Differences in chemical and physical soil properties were found between road verges and adjacent native vegetation areas. Soils from natural areas had higher humus levels, less gravel and sand, higher levels of nutrients, and higher pH and electrical conductivity than road verges. A relationship was found between soil properties and the occurrence of different exotic plant species along roadsides. Exotics dominated in areas along the road verge and road drainage lines. The dominant exotic found in these ecotypes was Achillea millefolium (yarrow). These ecotypes were characterized by high water and sediment wash off, which had significantly higher soil pH and exchangeable levels of calcium and potassium than natural areas and disturbed areas without yarrow.

AB Twenty-five microsatellite markers uniquely differentiated 35 avocado cultivars and two wild relatives. Average heterozygosity was high (60.7%), ranging from 32% in P. steyermarkii to 84% in Fuerte and Bacon. In a subset of 15 cultivars, heterozygosity averaged 63.5% for microsatellites, compared to 41.8% for restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs). A neighbor-joining tree, according to average shared allele distances, consisted of three clusters likely corresponding to the botanical races of avocado and intermediate clusters uniting genotypes of presumably racially hybrid origin. Several results were at odds with existing botanical assignments that are sometimes rendered difficult by incomplete pedigree information, the complexity of the hybrid status (multiple backcrossing), or both. For example, cv. Harvest clustered with the Guatemalan race cultivars, yet it is derived from the Guatemalan x Mexican hybrid cv. Gwen. Persea schiedeana grouped with cv. Bacon. The rootstock G875 emerged as the most divergent genotype in our data set. Considerable diversity was found particularly among accessions from Guatemala, including G810 (West Indian race), G6 (Mexican race), G755A (hybrid Guatemalan x P. schiedeana), and G875 (probably not P. americana). Low bootstrap support, even upon exclusion of (known) hybrid genotypes from the data matrix, suggests the existence of ancient hybridization or that the botanical races originated more recently than previously thought.

AB The Recovery Plan for the federally threatened Louisiana black bear (Ursus americanus luteolus) mandates that remnant populations be estimated and monitored. In 1999 we obtained genetic material with barbed-wire hair traps to estimate bear population size and genetic diversity at the 329-km(2) Tensas River Tract, Louisiana. We constructed and monitored 122 hair traps, which produced 1,939 hair samples. Of those, we randomly selected 116 subsamples for genetic analysis and used up to 12 microsatellite DNA markers to obtain multilocus genotypes for 58 individuals. We used Program CAPTURE to compute estimates of population size using multiple mark-recapture models. The area of study was almost entirely circumscribed by agricultural land, thus the population was geographically closed. Also, study-area boundaries were biologically discreet, enabling us to accurately estimate population density. Using model Chao M-h to account for possible effects of individual heterogeneity in capture probabilities, we estimated the population size to be 119 (SE = 29.4) bears, or 0.36 bears/km(2). We were forced to examine a substantial number of loci to differentiate between some individuals because of low genetic variation. Despite the probable introduction of genes from Minnesota bears in the, 1960s, the isolated population at Tensas exhibited characteristics consistent with inbreeding and genetic drift. Consequently, the effective population size at Tensas may be as few as 32, which warrants continued monitoring or possibly genetic augmentation.

AB Coregonine fishes are notorious taxonomic problems due to their extreme morphological and ecological variation. In North America, diversity is particularly baffling among ciscoes, and both morphological and phylogenetic analyses have resulted in major polytomy among the 8 taxa of the "Coregonus artedi" species complex. Ciscoes are also a devastated group, accounting for 10% of the fish species listed by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada. Here, we complete the genetic characterization of North American ciscoes with mitochondrial and microsatellites markers previously used to analyse populations of C. artedi in order to elucidate the evolutionary history and identify appropriate conservation units. Our results revealed a complex evolutionary history marked by postglacial reticulation events coupled with recent and independent evolution of similar phenotypes (taxa). Genetic variation reflects geography rather than taxonomy, and consequently, we recommend that a single taxon, C. artedi (sensu lato) be recognized. Local genetic differentiation is often coupled with ecophenotypic diversification, and gill raker polymorphisms, depth-related habitat preference and reproductive behaviour are considered as phenotypic traits with probable adaptive value contributing to the niche expansion of ciscoes. Ecomorphotypes of each particular locale thus represent a unique expression of a diverse genetic pool still undergoing divergence and sorting. Consequently, ciscoes from lakes with distinct ecomorphotypes are recognized as ESUs, as well as each of sympatric forms when they are genetically differentiated. We recommend that an ESU strategy focusing at a very local level be adopted for continental ciscoes as a valid alternative to protect significant evolutionary processes of divergence encountered in polytypic species of newly colonized habitats.

AB A paradigm is a set of mutually supportive hypotheses that provides a frame of reference within a field. In 1962, Kuhn proposed that paradigms form within the dual contexts of empirical evidence and intellectual history. Facts potentially contradictory to a paradigm may not be recognized until they are observed repeatedly and incorporated as supportive evidence into a new theory.
   Support for this interpretation can be found in the history of a paradigm of predation in rocky intertidal communities. Hypotheses were developed in the contexts of innovative field experiments and historical arguments of competition theory. The resulting paradigm proposed that predators restrict populations of competitively dominant prey to refuges. Different types of refuge, or no refuge, prevail in different areas of the intertidal zone, accounting for patterns of prey distribution, the coexistence of natural enemies, and the local maintenance of diversity. An ensuing period of criticism made reference to potential contradictions. Rather than by predation alone, prey abundances are determined largely by an interplay of varying rates of predation and prey production. Furthermore, prey refuges are neither necessary nor sufficient to explain all observed instances of local coexistence of predators and prey.
   We present a model in which intertidal boundaries of prey are set by equilibria between predation and prey production. Predation and prey productivity vary with environmental Gradients and with explicit spatial configurations of the prey. This synthesis relies on insights of the original paradigm, incorporates the contradictory observations, and depends on novel capabilities afforded by spatially explicit computer simulations. The resulting synthesis provides explanations for distinctive aspects of zonation, including abrupt prey boundaries in continuous gradients of predation, and converging upper and lower prey boundaries in gradients of decreasing wave exposure.

AB Three major phylogeographic lineages of the cottid fish Cottus gobio (bullhead) were identified in northern Europe from mitochondrial DNA sequences and allozyme data. The largely separate freshwater distributions of the lineages demonstrate distinct postglacial colonization histories. West of the Baltic Sea, Swedish lakes were invaded from the southwest (Germany). Another, eastern lineage has colonized the inland waters northeast and east of the Baltic, from refugia in northwest Russia; this lineage comprises a distinct subgroup found only from Estonia. The third lineage, found south and southeast of the Baltic, probably descended from rivers draining to the Black Sea from the north (e.g. Dnepr). In coastal waters of the Baltic Sea, and in near-coast inland waters, the lineages are now found intermixed in various combinations. The alternating fresh- and saltwater phases of the Baltic basin have variously enabled and disabled the use of coastal waters as colonization routes. Hypotheses on the chronology of dispersal and lineage mixing can be based on the distribution of the marker genes and the palaeohydrographical record. The diversity of the Fermoscandian bullhead thus comprises anciently diverged (probably mid-Pleistocene) refugial lineages that in their freshwater range constitute distinct evolutionarily significant units. The thorough mixing of the various genomic origins in and around the Baltic, however, refutes the controversial view of distinct species status for the western and eastern ('Cottus koshewnikowi') bullheads. The postglacial contact of the lineages has created new diversity that cannot be interpreted in a conventional hierarchical framework of taxonomic or conservation units.

AB Field and laboratory experiments demonstrate that juveniles of South African abalone (Haliotis midae) depend vitally on the protection from predation that they gain from living concealed beneath Cape urchins (Parechinus angulosus). Recent reports suggest that rock lobsters (Jasus lalandii) have increased substantially in the region where the commercial abalone fishery is centered. This increase has been blamed for a recorded collapse of urchin populations and dramatic reductions in the numbers of juvenile abalone. We verified the substantial increase in rock lobster abundance there. Surveys covering 200 km of coastline showed that densities of urchins were negatively correlated with those of large lobsters (> 68 mm carapace length) and that densities of juvenile abalone were positively correlated with those of urchins. The indirect negative effects of rock lobsters on juvenile abalone clearly pose a major threat to the abalone industry, already under stress from poaching. Quantification of the relationship between juvenile abalone and urchins and between urchins and rock lobsters allows a forecast of the magnitude of lobster harvesting necessary to reduce them to a level at which urchins may recover and sustain juvenile abalone. The complex interactions involved emphasize the importance of an ecosystem approach for the management of these stocks.

AB We used DNA analysis of galaxiid fish to test a hypothesis of localized headwater capture in South Island, New Zealand. The restricted western, but widespread eastern, distributions of three nonmigratory freshwater fish species suggest that part of the east-flowing Waiau River has been captured by the west-flowing fuller River. However, mitochondrial control region (Kimura 2-parameter distance = 4.1-5.4%) and microsatellite flanking sequences do not support a relationship between Waiau (N = 4 fish sequences) and western populations (N = 8) of Galaxias vulgaris. Instead, the point of capture is probably to the north-east, perhaps the Nelson lakes region. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that western populations, along with populations in the north-east (N = 18), represent a previously unidentified monophyletic Evolutionarily Significant Unit, possibly a cryptic species. We suggest a general caveat for zoogeographic conclusions based on distributional data alone.

AB Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase (Rubisco) efficiency for CO2-saturated photosynthesis was examined in leaves of rice (Oryza sativa L,), The amount of Rubisco in a leaf was calculated to be 30-55% in excess for the light-saturated rate of photosynthesis at 100 Pa CO2. Long-term exposure to CO2 enrichment decreased the amount of Rubisco protein. However, N was not reallocated from decreased Rubisco to other components limiting photosynthesis, and the decrease in Rubisco was simply due to a decrease in total leaf-N content by CO2 enrichment. Thus, rice plants did not optimize N allocation into Rubisco at elevated CO2 Transgenic rice plants with decreased Rubisco were obtained by transformation with the rbcS antisense gene, The transformant with 65% wild-type Rubisco was selected as a plant with optimal Rubisco content for CO2-saturated photosynthesis at the level of a single leaf, This selected transgenic plant had 20% lower rates of photosynthesis at normal CO2 (36 Pa), but 5-15% higher rates of photosynthesis at elevated CO2 (100 Pa) for a given leaf N content, However, such transgenic plants did not necessarily show greater production of biomass even under conditions of CO2 enrichment. Although they had a higher N-use efficiency for plant growth under such conditions during the middle stage of growth, the growth rate was lower during the early stage of growth, Thus, improvement of N-use efficiency by a single leaf did not necessarily lead to greater production of biomass by the whole plant.

AB In Brassica species, self-incompatibility is controlled genetically by haplotypes involving two known genes, SLG and SRK, and possibly an as yet unknown gene controlling pollen incompatibility types. Alleles at the incompatibility loci are maintained by frequency-dependent selection, and diversity at SLG and SRK appears to be very ancient, with high diversity at silent and replacement sites, particularly in certain "hypervariable" portions of the genes; It is important to test whether recombination occurs in these genes before inferences about function of different parts of the genes can be made from patterns of diversity within their sequences. In addition, it has been suggested that, to maintain the relationship between alleles within a given S-haplotype, recombination is suppressed in the S-locus region. The high diversity makes many population genetic measures of recombination inapplicable. We have analyzed linkage disequilibrium within the SLG gene of two Brassica species, using published coding sequences. The results suggest that intragenic recombination has occurred in the evolutionary history of these alleles. This is supported by patterns of synonymous nucleotide diversity within both the SLG and SRK genes, and between domains of the SRK gene. Finally, clusters of linkage disequilibrium within the SLG gene suggest that hypervariable regions are under balancing selection, and are not merely regions of relaxed selective constraint.

We critically evaluate evidence for these consequences from recent studies of settlement preferences, and note that most studies have concentrated on only a few common taxa. We recommend that this taxonomic base be broadened, and that settlement preferences be incorporated into future studies of the link between larval supply and population dynamics of reef fishes.

AB We conducted a field experiment to test the hypothesis that improved phosphorus nutrition occurs in maize plants with rapid arbuscular (AM) mycorrhizae development at early developmental stages and that this also is reflected in dry matter allocation and final yield. A split-split plot design was used with previous crop (Zea mays L.-maize and Brassica napus L.-canola), tillage practices (no-tillage or conventional tillage) and P fertilization (5 levels) as factors chosen to modify mycorrhizae development at early developmental stages of maize. Previous cropping with canola resulted in decreased shoot-P concentration and shoot growth of maize at early stages. No-tillage resulted in higher shoot-P concentration but lower shoot weight than conventional tillage. Greater shoot-P uptake was related to a rapid intraradical development of mycorrhizae (previous crop of maize) or rapid connection to a mycorrhizal mycelium network (no-tillage treatments). Maize yield and harvest index were lower after cropping With canola. The yield for conventional tillage was higher than that for no-tillage but the harvest index was lower. The hypothesis was supported at early stages of maize growth by the effect of previous crop but not by results of tillage, because an unknown factor reduced growth in the no-tillage system. The hypothesis was supported at maturity by increased biomass allocation to grain relative to total shoot weight in treatments with greater shoot-P concentration at early stages.

AB This study quantifies the contributions of larval recruitment and post-recruit (juvenile and adult) immigration to net increases in population size for 150 species of fishes found on ten isolated coral patches or 'bommies' (108-267 m(2)) within a typical reef of the Great Barrier Reef system. At least one third of the total number of recruits and immigrants to all bommies were post-recruit fishes, and movement between bommies in 136 species was detected at some time during the 22 month sampling period. The relative numbers of recruits and post-recruit immigrants per species varied widely within the assemblage, and between the replicate bommies. Populations of 95 species received both types of immigrants, 41 species had only post-recruit immigrants, and 14 species received only larval recruitment. In most species, recruitment occurred over the austral summer between October and February, while post-recruit movements occurred in both summer and winter. Rates of post-recruit immigration varied temporally within bommies, and pulses of post-recruits were less temporally concordant between bommies than pulses of recruits. This study is further evidence that post-settlement processes can have a significant effect on the local population size of reef fishes.

AB The importance of postrecruitment factors in determining assemblage structure of coral reef fishes is one of the most controversial topics in community ecology. To document the effects of predation on postlarval recruitment and the abundance of resident reef fishes, I manipulated small piscivorous fish on 12 model patch reefs located in uniform seagrass habitat in the U.S. Virgin Islands. Six reefs served as controls and 6 were used for predator removals. Weekly censuses were conducted for 2 mo before and after predator manipulations to document effects of removals. Removals of the squirrelfish Holocentrus adscensionis had a significant effect the recruitment and abundance of other species. During the first removal experiment, which was conducted during a peak recruitment period, high densities of squirrelfish depressed postlarval recruitment and juvenile abundance of grunts Haemulon spp., the most abundant species on the reefs. Following peak recruitment of grunts, a second squirrelfish removal resulted in increases in juvenile grunt abundance on predator-removal reefs. These results indicate the importance of postrecruitment factors, particularly predation, in structuring assemblages of coral reef fishes al a small spatial scale.

AB In a pot experiment, wheat was grown for 50 days in two heat-sterilized low-phosphorus (P) soils supplied with organic P as Na-phytate. Seed inoculation with the phosphatase-producing fungus (PPF) Aspergillus fumigatus or soil inoculation with the vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal (VAM) fungus Glomus mosseae increased shoot and root dry weight and root length, phosphatase activity in the rhizosphere and shoot concentrations of P and to a lesser extent of K and Mg. As a rule, the greatest effects on those parameters were most in the combined inoculation treatment (PPF+VAM). Shoot concentrations of Cu and Zn were only enhanced by VAM, not by PPE At harvest, depletion of organic P in the rhizosphere soil increased in the order of: sterilized soil < PPF < VAM < PPF+VAM which corresponded with the enhanced P concentrations in the plants. The results demonstrate that organic P in form of Na-Phytate is efficiently used by VAM and that use of organic P can be increased by simultaneous inoculation with phosphatase-producing fungi.

AB Competition among males to mate is generally associated with male-biased size dimorphism. In this study we examine mating behavior in the northern water snake (Nerodia sipedon), a species in which males are much smaller than females despite substantial competition among males to mate. Competition among males was a consequence of a male-biased operational sex ratio due to slightly higher female mortality from a birth sex ratio of 1:1, and, in 1 year, more synchronous and longer mating activity by males. Approximately one-third of both males and females appeared not to mate in a given year. Larger males were generally more likely to attempt mating, but size did not explain the variance in the number of aggregations in which individual males participated. Within aggregations, males that were successful at achieving intromission were larger than unsuccessful males in 1 of 2 years. Variation in condition (mass relative to length) and relative tail length were not generally useful predictors of either mating effort or success in males. Because large size was often advantageous to males, sexual size dimorphism appeared not to be a consequence of sexual selection favoring smaller males. Because sexual dimorphism was evident at birth, and both males and females matured sexually at about 4 years, sexual dimorphism was not simply a consequence of one sex growing at the maximum rate for longer. Female fecundity increased with size, and sex differences in size-fecundity relations may underly the pattern of sexual size dimorphism. However, because multiple mating by females is common, sperm competition is likely to be important in determining male reproductive success. Therefore, allocation of energy to sperm rather than growth may also prove to be an important influence on male growth rates and sexual size dimorphism.

AB Kelp forests dominate the rocky coasts of temperate Australia and are the foundation of the Great Southern Reef. Much like terrestrial forests, these marine forests create complex habitat for diverse communities of flora and fauna. Kelp forests also support coastal food-webs and valuable fisheries and provide a suite of additional ecosystem services. In many regions of Australia and around the world, kelp forests are in decline due to ocean warming, overgrazing, and pollution. One potential tool in the conservation and management of these important ecosystems is habitat restoration, the science and practice of which is currently undergoing substantial expansion. We summarize the present state of Australian kelp forests and emphasize that consideration of the initial drivers of kelp decline is a critical first step in restoration. With a focus on Australian examples, we review methods, implementation and outcomes of kelp forest restoration, and discuss suitable measures of success and the estimated costs of restoration activities. We propose a workflow and decision system for kelp forest restoration that identifies alternative pathways for implementation and acknowledges that under some circumstances restoration at scale is not possible or feasible. As a case study, we then apply the Society for Ecological Restoration's 5-star evaluation to Operation Crayweed, Australia's primary example of kelp forest restoration. Overall, no single method of kelp forest restoration is suitable for all situations, but outcomes can be optimized by ameliorating the driver(s) of kelp decline and achieving ongoing natural recruitment of kelp. Whilst scalability of kelp forest restoration to the seascape-scale remains a considerable challenge, the present review should provide a platform for future restoration efforts. However, it is also crucial to emphasize that the challenges of restoration place a high value on preventative conservation and protection of existing kelp forest ecosystems - prevention is invariably better than cure.

AB Comprehensive, time-scaled phylogenies provide a critical resource for many questions in ecology, evolution and biodiversity. Methodological advances have increased the breadth of taxonomic coverage in phylogenetic data; however, accessing and reusing these data remain challenging. We introduce the Fish Tree of Life website and associated r package fishtree to provide convenient access to sequences, phylogenies, fossil calibrations and diversification rate estimates for the most diverse group of vertebrate organisms, the ray-finned fishes. The Fish Tree of Life website presents subsets and visual summaries of phylogenetic and comparative data, and is complemented by the r package, which provides flexible programmatic access to the same underlying data source for advanced users wishing to extend or reanalyse the data. We demonstrate functionality with an overview of the website, and show three examples of advanced usage through the r package. First, we test for the presence of long branch attraction artefacts across the fish tree of life. The second example examines the effects of habitat on diversification rate in the pufferfishes. The final example demonstrates how a community phylogenetic analysis could be conducted with the package. This resource makes a large comparative vertebrate dataset easily accessible via the website, while the r package enables the rapid reuse and reproducibility of research results via its ability to easily integrate with other r packages and software for molecular biology and comparative methods.

AB Drought-induced tree mortality alters forest structure and function, yet our ability to predict when and how different species die during drought remains limited. Here, we explore how stomatal control and drought tolerance traits influence the duration of drought stress leading to critical levels of hydraulic failure. We examined the growth and physiological responses of four woody plant species (three angiosperms and one conifer) representing a range of water-use and drought tolerance traits over the course of two controlled drought-recovery cycles followed by an extended dry-down. At the end of the final dry-down phase, we measured changes in biomass ratios and leaf carbohydrates. During the first and second drought phases, plants of all species closed their stomata in response to decreasing water potential, but only the conifer species avoided water potentials associated with xylem embolism as a result of early stomatal closure relative to thresholds of hydraulic dysfunction. The time it took plants to reach critical levels of water stress during the final dry-down was similar among the angiosperms (ranging from 39 to 57 days to stemP(88)) and longer in the conifer (156 days to stemP(50)). Plant dry-down time was influenced by a number of factors including species stomatal-hydraulic safety margin (g(s)P(90) - stemP(50)), as well as leaf succulence and minimum stomatal conductance. Leaf carbohydrate reserves (starch) were not depleted at the end of the final dry-down in any species, irrespective of the duration of drought. These findings highlight the need to consider multiple structural and functional traits when predicting the timing of hydraulic failure in plants.

AB Identifying which ecological and life history traits influence a species' tolerance to urbanization is critical to understanding the trajectory of biodiversity in an increasingly urbanizing world. There is evidence for a wide array of contrasting patterns for single trait associations with urbanization. In a continental-scale analysis, incorporating 477 species and >5 000 000 bird observations, we developed a novel and scalable methodology that evaluated the ecological and life history traits which most influence a species' adaptability to persist in urban environments. Specifically, we assigned species-specific scores based on continuous measures of response to urbanization, using VIIRS night-time light values (i.e. radiance) as a proxy for urbanization. We identified generalized, phylogenetically controlled patterns: bird species which are generalists (i.e. large niche breadth), with large clutch size, and large residual brain size are among the most urban-tolerant bird species. Conversely, specialized feeding strategies (i.e. insectivores and granivores) were negatively associated with urbanization. Enhancement and persistence of avian biodiversity in urban environments probably relies on protecting, maintaining and restoring diverse habitats serving a range of life history strategies.

AB Whereas the primary controls on litter decomposition are well established, we lack a framework for predicting interspecific differences in litter decay within and across ecosystems. Given previous research linking tree mycorrhizal association with carbon and nutrient dynamics, we hypothesized that the two dominant mycorrhizal groups in forests - arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) and ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi - differ in litter decomposition rates. We compiled leaf litter chemistry and decay data for AM- and ECM-associating angiosperms and gymnosperms (> 200 species) from temperate and tropical/subtropical, and investigated relationships among decay rates, mycorrhizal association, phylogeny and climate. In temperate forests, AM litters decayed faster than ECM litters, with litter nitrogen and phylogeny best explaining variation in litter decay. In sub/tropical forests, we found no significant difference in litter decay rate between mycorrhizal groups, and variation in decay rates was best explained by litter phosphorus. Our results suggest that knowledge of tree mycorrhizal association may improve predictions of species effects on ecosystem processes, particularly in temperate forests where AM and ECM species commonly co-occur, providing a predictive framework for linking litter quality, organic matter dynamics and nutrient acquisition in forests.

AB Substitution of chemical nitrogen (N) with organic fertilizers in agricultural ecosystems has been promoted to sustain crop yield and soil quality. Soil microbes play key roles in soil nutrient cycling after organic matter addition. However, there is limited information about the effect of the organic substitution ratio (OSR) on soil bacterial communities, which are considered as a good indicator of soil quality in a tea plantation. In this study, a long-term field experiment with six treatments was established to study the effect of different OSRs of N, from pure synthetic fertilization (NPK) to 100% N substituted with organic fertilizer (OM100), on tea yield and soil bacterial communities. The soil bacterial community composition was measured using a high-throughput sequencing technique. The results showed that as the OSR increased, the soil bacterial diversity increased and the community structure shifted significantly. However, 25% N substituted with organic fertilizer (OM25) produced the highest yield. Additionally, the soil pH and organic carbon (SOC) were the predominant soil characteristics that accounted for the soil bacterial community structural change. With more chemical N being substituted with organic fertilizer, the soil pH, available potassium, SOC, total N, and microbial biomass C and N, were elevated; however, the yield of fresh tea leaves decreased. These results indicated the trade-off effect between tea yield and soil bacterial diversity under different OSRs, which could also alter the soil bacterial communities by changing soil characteristics.

AB Temperate eels Anguilla anguilla (European eel), A.rostrata (American eel) and A.japonica (Japanese eel) are three catadromous species which have been declining since the 1970s/1980s despite their remarkable adaptive capacity. Because of their specific life cycles, which share distant oceanic spawning grounds and continental growth stage, eels are affected by five components of the global change: (a) climate change affecting larval survival and drift, (b) an increase in pollution leading to high levels of contamination exacerbated by their high lipid levels, (c) increasing fragmentation and habitat loss that reduce dramatically the amount of available habitats and induce increased spawner mortality, (d) the appearance of Anguillicola crassus a parasitic alien nematode that impairs spawning success, and (e) the impact of commercial and recreational fisheries for all life stages of eel. In this context, the rapid increases of pressures during the Great Acceleration have surpassed the adaptive capacity of eels. This illustrates that cumulative effects of global change can lead to the collapse of species, even in species that have amazingly high adaptive capacities.

AB Aim: Despite several recent efforts to map plant traits and to identify their climatic drivers, there are still major gaps. Global trait patterns for major functional groups, in particular, the differences between woody and herbaceous plants, have yet to be identified. Here, we take advantage of big data efforts to compile plant species occurrence and trait data to analyse the spatial patterns of assemblage means and variances of key plant traits. We tested whether these patterns and their climatic drivers are similar for woody and herbaceous plants.
   Location: New World (North and South America).
   Methods: Using the largest currently available database of plant occurrences, we provide maps of 200 x 200 km grid-cell trait means and variances for both woody and herbaceous species and identify environmental drivers related to these patterns. We focus on six plant traits: maximum plant height, specific leaf area, seed mass, wood density, leaf nitrogen concentration and leaf phosphorus concentration.
   Results: For woody assemblages, we found a strong climate signal for both means and variances of most of the studied traits, consistent with strong environmental filtering. In contrast, for herbaceous assemblages, spatial patterns of trait means and variances were more variable, the climate signal on trait means was often different and weaker.
   Main conclusion: Trait variations for woody versus herbaceous assemblages appear to reflect alternative strategies and differing environmental constraints. Given that most large-scale trait studies are based on woody species, the strikingly different biogeographic patterns of herbaceous traits suggest that a more synthetic framework is needed that addresses how suites of traits within and across broad functional groups respond to climate.

AB Water deficit (WD) is expected to increase in intensity, frequency and duration in many parts of the world as a consequence of global change, with potential negative effects on plant gas exchange and growth. We review here the parameters that can be derived from measurements made on leaves, in the field, and that can be used to assess the effects of WD on the components of plant photosynthetic rate, including stomatal conductance, mesophyll conductance, photosynthetic capacity, light absorbance, and efficiency of absorbed light conversion into photosynthetic electron transport. We also review some of the parameters related to dissipation of excess energy and to rerouting of electron fluxes. Our focus is mainly on the techniques of gas exchange measurements and of measurements of chlorophyll a fluorescence (ChlF), either alone or combined. But we put also emphasis on some of the parameters derived from analysis of the induction phase of maximal ChlF, notably because they could be used to assess damage to photosystem II. Eventually we briefly present the non-destructive methods based on the ChlF excitation ratio method which can be used to evaluate non-destructively leaf contents in anthocyanins and flavonols.

AB AimMetacommunity assembly mechanisms have been traditionally considered stable through time. However, in highly dynamic systems with varying local environmental conditions and patch connectivity, communities are likely to experience temporal shifts in their assembly mechanisms. Here, we used a set of perennial (PR) and intermittent (IR) rivers to assess if assembly mechanisms vary seasonally in response to flow intermittence.
   LocationMediterranean climate region (100,000km(2)), Spain.
   MethodsWe used a modelling approach to assess the relative effect of environmental sorting and dispersal-based processes on aquatic invertebrate metacommunities within and across river types at four distinct hydrological periods. We used local environmental variables to assess environmental sorting, and considered geographical, network and topographical distances as different dispersal surrogates. Linear mixed effect models accounting for the non-independence of pairwise distances were used to assess the relationships between community dissimilarity and distance matrices.
   ResultsAssembly mechanisms were more temporally stable in PR than in IR. In PR, community dissimilarities were equally related to environmental and geographical distances suggesting codominance of species sorting and dispersal-based assembly mechanisms. In IR, environmental distance best explained community dissimilarities during the dry period when flow cessation imposes strong environmental sorting, whereas metacommunity organization was much more stochastic during the rewetting period when high flows may randomly reorganize communities. Dispersal processes dominated assembly mechanisms between PR and IR during the rewetting period suggesting an increase in recolonization processes linking both river types following the dry period. Geographical and topographical distances best explained community variability, suggesting that overland dispersal dominates in river networks fragmented by drying events.
   Main conclusionsAquatic invertebrate metacommunity assembly mechanisms vary seasonally in response to changes in hydrological conditions. The temporal dimension should be better incorporated into metacommunity studies in highly dynamic systems such as intermittent rivers.

AB About 100 km east of Rome, in the central Apennine Mountains, a critically endangered population of similar to 50 brown bears live in complete isolation. Mating outside this population is prevented by several 100 km of bear-free territories. We exploited this natural experiment to better understand the gene and genomic consequences of surviving at extremely small population size. We found that brown bear populations in Europe lost connectivity since Neolithic times, when farming communities expanded and forest burning was used for land clearance. In central Italy, this resulted in a 40-fold population decline. The overall genomic impact of this decline included the complete loss of variation in the mitochondrial genome and along long stretches of the nuclear genome. Several private and deleterious amino acid changes were fixed by random drift; predicted effects include energy deficit, muscle weakness, anomalies in cranial and skeletal development, and reduced aggressiveness. Despite this extreme loss of diversity, Apennine bear genomes show nonrandom peaks of high variation, possibly maintained by balancing selection, at genomic regions significantly enriched for genes associated with immune and olfactory systems. Challenging the paradigm of increased extinction risk in small populations, we suggest that random fixation of deleterious alleles (i) can be an important driver of divergence in isolation, (ii) can be tolerated when balancing selection prevents random loss of variation at important genes, and (iii) is followed by or results directly in favorable behavioral changes.

AB Landscape services can be understood as the spatial explicit and human action produced ecosystem services at the landscape scale. Mapping multiple landscape services of agricultural land at various spatiotemporal scales can reveal the distribution and evolution of landscape services. However, further investigation into the spatiotemporal evolution and driving force of agricultural landscape multifunctionality is still needed. In this study, six landscape services (food supply, habitat maintenance, habitat connectivity, soil retention, landscape aesthetics, and population carrier) were quantified in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, China. Then, Spearman's rank correlation, partial correlation, principal component analysis and geographically weighted regression were used to identify the driving forces of agricultural landscape multifunctionality. The results showed that agricultural landscape multifunctionality generally increased during 2000-2010. The vegetation factor of NDVI was the most important natural indicator influencing landscape multifunctionality, while the gross domestic product was the most related social indicator. In a spatial non-stationary background, the vegetation component positively influenced multifunctionality; the impacts of the social component were negative in the center of the study area, but positive in the north and east. Because multifunctional landscapes are regarded as one spatial approach to achieving landscape sustainability, far more attentions should be paid to spatial non-stationarity of driving forces associated with agriculture landscape multifunctionality.

AB Context Despite increasing evidence that landscape composition and configuration strongly influence the community structure of potential pest-regulators, landscape structure has seldom been explicitly linked with the rate and magnitude of pest-control services.
   Objectives and methods We conducted a systematic literature review evaluating 158 relevant studies to: (1) characterize our existing understanding of the empirical relationships between landscape structure and avian-mediated insect pest control services in agricultural systems, (2) identify gaps in our current understanding, and (3) develop a conceptual model of landscape structural influences on avian-mediated pest control.
   Results and discussion We found on-farm pest suppression by birds was often higher in landscapes with higher native habitat cover, higher compositional heterogeneity, and in agricultural patches in closer proximity to native habitats. We identified more than 200 bird species that provide pest control services across both temperate and tropical regions. While most avian predators are habitat-generalist species, a substantial fraction of pest control services in tropical regions was mediated by habitat-dependent species, suggesting a link between conservation management and maintenance of pest control services. We identified a three-part research agenda for future investigations of the relationships between landscape structure and avian-mediated pest control, focusing on an improved understanding of mechanisms related to: (1) predator-prey interactions and landscape modulation of trophic relationships, (2) bird dispersal ability and landscape connectivity, and (3) cross-habitat spillover of habitat-dependent avian predators.
   Implications These findings can be applied to efforts to manage and design landscapes capable of supporting both biodiversity and ecosystem services.

AB 1. Preventing the arrival of invasive alien species (IAS) is a major priority in managing biological invasions. However, information on introduction pathways is currently scattered across many data bases that often use different categorisations to describe similar pathways. This hampers the identification and prioritisation of pathways to meet the main targets of recent environmental policies.
   2. Therefore, we integrate pathway information from two major IAS data bases, IUCN's Global Invasive Species Database (GISD) and the DAISIE European Invasive Alien Species Gateway, applying the new standard categorisation scheme recently adopted by the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). We describe the process of mapping pathways from the individual data bases to the CBD scheme and provide, for the first time, detailed descriptions of the standard pathway categories. The combined data set includes pathway information for 8323 species across major taxonomic groups (plants, vertebrates, invertebrates, algae, fungi, other) and environments (terrestrial, freshwater, marine).
   3. We analyse the data for major patterns in the introduction pathways, highlighting that the specific research question and context determines whether the combined or an individual data set is the better information source for such analyses. While the combined data set provides an improved basis for direction-setting in invasion management policies on the global level, individual data sets often better reflect regional idiosyncrasies. The combined data set should thus be considered in addition to, rather than replacing, existing individual data sets.
   4. Pathway patterns derived from the combined and individual data sets show that the intentional pathways 'Escape' and 'Release' are most important for plants and vertebrates, while for invertebrates, algae, fungi and micro-organisms unintentional transport pathways prevail. Differences in pathway proportions among marine, freshwater and terrestrial environments are much less pronounced. The results also show that IAS with highest impacts in Europe are on average associated with a greater number of pathways than other alien species and are more frequently introduced both intentionally and unintentionally.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Linking data bases on invasive alien species by harmonising and consolidating their pathway information is essential to turn dispersed data into useful knowledge. The standard pathway categorisation scheme recently adopted by the Convention on Biological Diversity may be crucial to facilitate this process. Our study demonstrates the value of integrating major invasion data bases to help managers and policymakers reach robust conclusions about patterns in introduction pathways and thus aid effective prevention and prioritisation in invasion management.

AB Understanding the relationships between ecosystem services is important for promoting ecosystem service management and sustainable development. The relationships between ecosystem services have commonly been characterized as tradeoffs and synergies. Here, we report that a third type of relationship also exists, in which one ecosystem service constrains the other. Selecting the grassland and agropastoral transitional zone of North China (GAPTZ) as the study area, we examined the relationships between paired ecosystem services: net primary productivity (NPP), soil conservation (SC), soil erosion by wind (SL), water yield (WY), and water retention (WR). The constraint effect of one ecosystem service on the other was determined by extracting the upper constraint lines from the scatter plots of the paired ecosystem services with segmented quantile regression on the levels of landscape, class, and ecoregion. Our results revealed eight types of constraint effects between the ten paired ecosystem services: (1) positive linear, (2) negative linear, (3) logarithmic, (4) negative convex, (5) backward S-shaped, (6) hump shaped, (7) convex-waved, and.(8) concave-waved. At the landscape, class, and ecoregion levels, there was a hump-shaped constraint effect between NPP and SC. Precipitation was the main factor shaping the constraint line of the paired NPP-SC. The gradually increasing constraint effect of higher NPP on WY indicated that, in arid and semiarid areas, improving NPP decreases water yield. In farmland areas, the backward S-shaped constraint line of the paired NPP-SL indicates that crops, unlike forests and grasslands, could not protect soil from wind erosion. The constraint effects of SL on WY and WR are negative convex on the landscape level and convex-waved or concave-waved on the class and ecoregion levels. The constraint line approach enriches the understanding of linkages between ecosystem services and the potential drivers. The constraint effects of ecosystem services have important implications for sustainable land use planning to optimize landscapes services. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The global demand for agricultural products will increase in the 21st century, unless major transformations in consumptive behaviour occur. To a large extent, production increases in agriculture will depend on intensifying existing agricultural systems. Yet, our understanding of what determines the spatial patterns of agricultural intensity and changes therein is limited. Here, we analysed agricultural intensity changes in Europe focussing on yields and fertiliser application for six major crop-type groups for the period 1990-2007. We applied random effects panel regressions to analyse the spatial determinants of intensity changes using a suite of biophysical and socio-economic variables. We found that yields increased and mineral nitrogen application decreased by approximately 10%, suggesting a decoupling of changes in output and input intensity in Europe's agricultural systems. Yields and nitrogen application across crop-type groups were particularly high in Western and Central Europe, whereas Eastern Europe was characterised by lower yields and nitrogen application. We also found strong sub-national variation in intensity levels in respect to crop-type groups and indicators. Higher yields were typically related to higher fertilisation, high soil quality, less growing degree days, and high labour productivity. Higher nitrogen application rates, in turn, were related to high soil water and carbon contents, and high labour productivity. Our study provides insights into broad-scale agricultural intensity patterns in Europe that allow for identifying trade-offs between agriculture and the environment, as well as entry points for regionalised, targeted policy making towards a more sustainable management of Europe land systems.

AB Biodiversity experiments have generated robust empirical results supporting the hypothesis that ecosystems function betterwhen they containmore species. Given that ecosystems provide services that are valued by humans, this inevitably suggests that the loss of species from natural ecosystems could diminish their value. This raises two important questions. First, will experimental results translate into the real world, where species are being lost at an alarming rate? And second, what are the benefits and pitfalls of such valuation exercises? We argue that the empirical results obtained in experiments are entirely consistent with well-established theories of species coexistence. We then examine the current body of work through the lens of niche theory and highlight where closer links with theory could open up opportunities for future research. We argue that niche theory predicts that diversity-functioning relationships are likely to be stronger (and require more species) in the field than in simplified experimental settings. However, we caution that while many of the biological processes that promote coexistence can also generate diversity-function relationships, there is no simple mapping between the two. This implies that valuation exercises need to proceed with care.

AB The phylogeography of species associated with European steppes and extrazonal xeric grasslands is poorly understood. This paper summarizes the results of recent studies on the phylogeography and conservation genetics of animals (20 taxa of beetles, butterflies, reptiles and rodents) and flowering plants (18 taxa) of such, "steppic" habitats in Eastern Central Europe. Most species show a similar phylogeographic pattern: relatively high genetic similarity within regional groups of populations and moderate-to-high genetic distinctiveness of populations from currently isolated regions located in the studied area. This distinctiveness of populations suggests a survival here during glacial maxima, including areas north of the Bohemian Massif-Carpathians arc. Steppic species generally do not follow the paradigmatic patterns known for temperate biota (south-north "contraction-expansion"), but to some extent are similar to those of arctic-alpine taxa. There are three main groups of taxa within Eastern Central Europe that differ in their contemporary distribution pattern, which may reflect historical origin and expansion routes. Present diversity patterns of the studied steppic species suggest that they share a unique genetic signature and distinct assemblages exist in each of the now isolated areas rich in steppic habitats. At least some of these areas probably act as present "interglacial refugia" for steppic species. This study strongly supports the need to protect steppic species throughout their entire ranges in the region, as the continuous destruction of steppic habitats in some areas may lead not only to the disappearance of local populations, but also to the extinction of unique evolutionary units.

AB Competition is an important force shaping plant communities. Here we test the hypothesis that high overall root length density and selective root placement in nutrient patches, as two alternative strategies, confer competitive advantage in species mixtures.
   We performed a full-factorial pairwise competition experiment with eight grassland species in soil with homogeneously distributed nutrients, or with nutrients concentrated in a single patch. We measured species-specific relative growth rate, root length density, selective root placement, and ion uptake rates of all species in monocultures and in mixtures.
   Grasses showed higher specific root length overall and forbs a higher selective root placement in the nutrient patch. However, relative growth rate and root length density were more strongly related to competitive ability (measured as relative yield per plant), with little distinction between grasses and forbs.
   Our results suggest that short-term competitive success was related to fast growth and high root densities, irrespective of nutrient heterogeneity. Developing a large root mass quickly may overwhelm the importance of other traits in the establishment phase of plants, although these other traits may prove to be important in the long run.

AB This study provides an overview of successful genetic improvement programmes for important farmed aquaculture species in Asia, with a focus on lessons and experiences gained as well as challenges remaining. In both fish and prawns (Macrobrachium rosenbergii), conventional selective breeding approaches have resulted in significant improvement in productivity, with genetic gains ranging from 8 to 12% per generation. Selection for high growth has also brought about beneficial changes in fillet weight of fish and edible meat in prawns without detrimental effects on flesh quality attributes and fitness-related traits. Genetically improved animals show remarkable vigour and high adaptation to a range of culture environments/conditions in Asian countries. Despite these successes, however, the conduct and practical implementation of such breeding programmes still present several challenges. These include the expansion of breeding objectives, management of inbreeding in closed-selection populations, controlling the effects of genotype by environment interactions, simultaneous production of large number of full- and half-sib families for species with asynchronous spawning behaviour, maintaining pedigree records, dissemination of the improved strains for widespread production, as well as a reluctance by many to carry out systematically designed genetic improvement for aquatic animal species. There are also challenges with regard to the application of genomic information in genetic enhancement programmes and the development of genetically improved strains in response to climate and environmental changes. In this study, each of these challenges is discussed and solutions are proposed to increase efficiency of future genetic improvement programmes for economically important aquaculture species.

AB The impact of long-term nitrogen (N) deposition is under-studied in phosphorus (P)-limited subtropical forests. We exploited historically collected herbarium specimens to investigate potential physiological responses of trees in three subtropical forests representing an urban-to-rural gradient, across which N deposition has probably varied over the past six decades. We measured foliar [N] and [P] and stable carbon (C-13), oxygen (O-18) and nitrogen (N-15) isotopic compositions in tissue from herbarium specimens of plant species collected from 1947 to 2014. Foliar [N] and N:P increased, and N-15 and [P] decreased in the two forests close to urban centers. Consistent with recent studies demonstrating that N deposition in the region is N-15-depleted, these data suggest that the increased foliar [N] and N:P, and decreased [P], may be attributable to atmospheric deposition and associated enhancement of P limitation. Estimates of intrinsic water use efficiency calculated from foliar C-13 decreased by c. 30% from the 1950s to 2014, contrasting with multiple studies investigating similar parameters in N-limited forests. This effect may reflect decreased photosynthesis, as suggested by a conceptual model of foliar C-13 and O-18. Long-term N deposition may exacerbate P limitation and mitigate projected increases in carbon stocks driven by elevated CO2 in forests on P-limited soils.

AB Functional diversity (FD) is an important component of biodiversity that quantifies the difference in functional traits between organisms. However, FD studies are often limited by the availability of trait data and FD indices are sensitive to data gaps. The distribution of species abundance and trait data, and its transformation, may further affect the accuracy of indices when data is incomplete. Using an existing approach, we simulated the effects of missing trait data by gradually removing data from a plant, an ant and a bird community dataset (12, 59, and 8 plots containing 62, 297 and 238 species respectively). We ranked plots by FD values calculated from full datasets and then from our increasingly incomplete datasets and compared the ranking between the original and virtually reduced datasets to assess the accuracy of FD indices when used on datasets with increasingly missing data. Finally, we tested the accuracy of FD indices with and without data transformation, and the effect of missing trait data per plot or per the whole pool of species. FD indices became less accurate as the amount of missing data increased, with the loss of accuracy depending on the index. But, where transformation improved the normality of the trait data, FD values from incomplete datasets were more accurate than before transformation. The distribution of data and its transformation are therefore as important as data completeness and can even mitigate the effect of missing data. Since the effect of missing trait values pool-wise or plot-wise depends on the data distribution, the method should be decided case by case. Data distribution and data transformation should be given more careful consideration when designing, analysing and interpreting FD studies, especially where trait data are missing. To this end, we provide the R package "traitor" to facilitate assessments of missing trait data.

AB PREMISE OF THE STUDY: The ability of California tree populations to survive anthropogenic climate change will be shaped by the geographic structure of adaptive genetic variation. Our goal is to test whether climate-associated candidate genes show evidence of spatially divergent selection in natural populations of valley oak, Quercus lobata, as preliminary indication of local adaptation.
   METHODS: Using DNA from 45 individuals from 13 localities across the species' range, we sequenced portions of 40 candidate genes related to budburst/flowering, growth, osmotic stress, and temperature stress. Using 195 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), we estimated genetic differentiation across populations and correlated allele frequencies with climate gradients using single-locus and multivariate models.
   RESULTS: The top 5% of FST estimates ranged from 0.25 to 0.68, yielding loci potentially under spatially divergent selection. Environmental analyses of SNP frequencies with climate gradients revealed three significantly correlated SNPs within budburst/flowering genes and two SNPs within temperature stress genes with mean annual precipitation, after controlling for multiple testing. A redundancy model showed a significant association between SNPs and climate variables and revealed a similar set of SNPs with high loadings on the first axis. In the RDA, climate accounted for 67% of the explained variation, when holding climate constant, in contrast to a putatively neutral SSR data set where climate accounted for only 33%.
   CONCLUSIONS: Population differentiation and geographic gradients of allele frequencies in climate-associated functional genes in Q. lobata provide initial evidence of adaptive genetic variation and background for predicting population response to climate change.

AB 1. Science and policy worldwide are influenced by predictions from bioeconomic theory that fishing cannot lead fish populations to extinction because fishing effort inevitably moves away from depleted resources. Yet such predictions contradict evidence of fishing-induced extinctions and in particular a model, called 'fishing-down', that explains historical reductions in mean size of harvested species in tropical multispecies fisheries through the gradual depletion and extinction of large-bodied species.
   2. This study analysed data on fisheries for Arapaima spp., the most historically important and overexploited fishes of the Amazon Basin, to evaluate whether they supported bioeconomic or fishing-down predictions. The evaluation was based on census data on arapaima populations and interview data from 182 fishers with respect to fishing practices and management regulations, which were collected in 81 fishing communities covering 1040 km(2) of Amazonian floodplains.
   3. Arapaima populations were found to be 'depleted' in 76% of the fishing communities, 'overexploited' in 17%, 'well-managed' in 5%, and 'unfished' in only 2%. Population densities were zero (i.e. locally extinct) in 19% of the communities. Twenty-three per cent of the fishers in each community harvested arapaima regardless of population status. Similarly, the percentage of the catch in compliance with the size regulation did not vary with population status, but compliance with the season regulation in communities with 'overexploited' or 'depleted' populations (72%) was lower than in communities with 'well-managed' or 'unfished' populations (97%).
   4. These results support fishing-down predictions that fishing pressure continues to occur even when fish populations are depleted. The fishing-down process appeared to occur because of low gear selectivity and larger body-size of target species as well as high species value and low fishing costs. These results and available data elsewhere suggest that fishing-induced extinctions are more common than previously thought, endangering biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. Such extinctions are probably going unnoticed because high levels of illegal fishing, geographic heterogeneity, and data scarcity make their identification difficult.

AB Functional ecology often analyses a few selected traits and relates them either to environmental conditions or ecosystem properties. However, not the individual trait, but the whole plant with a set of coordinated traits responds to the environment or affects ecosystem properties. Here we argue that the correlation among traits of all major plant organs should be an integral part of response or effect studies. Plants allocate elements and biomass among roots, perennial clonal organs, stems, leaves and seeds to ensure growth and reproduction. Assessment of trait responses to the environment and effects on ecosystems is hardly possible without simultaneously considering all plant organs and the biological functions they perform, namely resource uptake, vegetative regeneration, support and hydraulic pathways, photosynthesis and generative reproduction. Suitable traits to indicate these functions include those of mass, density, size, volume, and element contents of the main plant organs. In principle, we do not propose to collect many traits, but those of similar significance across organs. For instance, specific leaf area should be complemented by specific root length and specific stem length. We present some thoughts on how coordinated allocation to biological functions sets boundaries to the range of trait expressions in successional series and consequently also to species responses to the environment and effects on ecosystems. Considering the coordination of traits amongst all major plant organs will improve our understanding of plant strategies ensuring survival in patterned landscapes.

AB Identifying refugia is a critical component of effective conservation of biodiversity under anthropogenic climate change. However, despite a surge in conceptual and practical interest, identifying refugia remains a significant challenge across diverse continental landscapes. We provide an overview of the key properties of refugia that promote species' persistence under climate change, including their capacity to (i) buffer species from climate change; (ii) sustain long-term population viability and evolutionary processes; (iii) minimize the potential for deleterious species interactions, provided that the refugia are (iv) available and accessible to species under threat. Further, we classify refugia in terms of the environmental and biotic stressors that they provide protection from (i.e. thermal, hydric, cyclonic, pyric and biotic refugia), but ideally refugia should provide protection from a multitude of stressors. Our systematic characterization of refugia facilitates the identification of refugia in the Australian landscape. Challenges remain, however, specifically with respect to how to assess the quality of refugia at the level of individual species and whole species assemblages. It is essential that these challenges are overcome before refugia can live up to their acclaim as useful targets for conservation and management in the context of climate change.

AB Complexity is increasingly the hallmark in environmental management practices of sandy shorelines. This arises primarily from meeting growing public demands (e.g., real estate, recreation) whilst reconciling economic demands with expectations of coastal users who have modern conservation ethics. Ideally, shoreline management is underpinned by empirical data, but selecting ecologically-meaningful metrics to accurately measure the condition of systems, and the ecological effects of human activities, is a complex task. Here we construct a framework for metric selection, considering six categories of issues that authorities commonly address: erosion; habitat loss; recreation; fishing; pollution (litter and chemical contaminants); and wildlife conservation. Possible metrics were scored in terms of their ability to reflect environmental change, and against criteria that are widely used for judging the performance of ecological indicators (i.e., sensitivity, practicability, costs, and public appeal). From this analysis, four types of broadly applicable metrics that also performed very well against the indicator criteria emerged: 1.) traits of bird populations and assemblages (e.g., abundance, diversity, distributions, habitat use); 2.) breeding/reproductive performance sensu lato (especially relevant for birds and turtles nesting on beaches and in dunes, but equally applicable to invertebrates and plants); 3.) population parameters and distributions of vertebrates associated primarily with dunes and the supralittoral beach zone (traditionally focused on birds and turtles, but expandable to mammals); 4.) compound measurements of the abundance/cover/biomass of biota (plants, invertebrates, vertebrates) at both the population and assemblage level. Local constraints (i.e., the absence of birds in highly degraded urban settings or lack of dunes on bluff-backed beaches) and particular issues may require alternatives. Metrics - if selected and applied correctly provide empirical evidence of environmental condition and change, but often do not reflect deeper environmental values per se. Yet, values remain poorly articulated for many beach systems; this calls for a comprehensive identification of environmental values and the development of targeted programs to conserve these values on sandy shorelines globally.

AB Global climate changes during the Quaternary reveal much about broader evolutionary effects of environmental change. Detailed regional studies reveal how evolutionary lineages and novel communities and ecosystems, emerge through glacial bottlenecks or from refugia. There have been significant advances in benthic imaging and dating, particularly with respect to the movements of the British (Scottish) and Irish ice sheets and associated changes in sea level during and after the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Ireland has been isolated as an island for approximately twice as long as Britain with no evidence of any substantial, enduring land bridge between these islands after ca 15 kya. Recent biogeographical studies show that Britain's mammal community is akin to those of southern parts of Scandinavia, The Netherlands and Belgium, but the much lower mammal species richness of Ireland is unique and needs explanation. Here, we consider physiographic, archaeological, phylogeographical i.e. molecular genetic, and biological evidence comprising ecological, behavioural and morphological data, to review how mammal species recolonized western Europe after the LGM with emphasis on Britain and, in particular, Ireland. We focus on why these close neighbours had such different mammal fauna in the early Holocene, the stability of ecosystems after LGM subject to climate change and later species introductions.
   There is general concordance of archaeological and molecular genetic evidence where data allow some insight into history after the LGM. Phylogeography reveals the process of recolonization, e.g. with respect to source of colonizers and anthropogenic influence, whilst archaeological data reveal timing more precisely through carbon dating and stratigraphy. More representative samples and improved calibration of the 'molecular clock' will lead to further insights with regards to the influence of successive glaciations. Species showing greatest morphological, behavioural and ecological divergence in Ireland in comparison to Britain and continental Europe, were also those which arrived in Ireland very early in the Holocene either with or without the assistance of people. Cold tolerant mammal species recolonized quickly after LGM but disappeared, potentially as a result of a short period of rapid warming. Other early arrivals were less cold tolerant and succumbed to the colder conditions during the Younger Dryas or shortly after the start of the Holocene (11.5 kya), or the area of suitable habitat was insufficient to sustain a viable population especially in larger species. Late Pleistocene mammals in Ireland were restricted to those able to colonize up to ca 15 kya, probably originating from adjacent areas of unglaciated Britain and land now below sea level, to the south and west (of Ireland). These few, early colonizers retain genetic diversity which dates from before the LGM. Late Pleistocene Ireland, therefore, had a much depleted complement of mammal species in comparison to Britain.
   Mammal species, colonising predominantly from southeast and east Europe occupied west Europe only as far as Britain between ca 15 and 8 kya, were excluded from Ireland by the Irish and Celtic Seas. Smaller species in particular failed to colonise Ireland. Britain being isolated as an island from ca. 8 kya has similar species richness and composition to adjacent lowland areas of northwest continental Europe and its mammals almost all show strongest genetic affinity to populations in neighbouring continental Europe with a few retaining genotypes associated with earlier, western lineages.
   The role of people in the deliberate introduction of mammal species and distinct genotypes is much more significant with regards to Ireland than Britain reflecting the larger species richness of the latter and its more enduring land link with continental Europe. The prime motivation of early people in moving mammals was likely to be resource driven but also potentially cultural; as elsewhere, people exploring uninhabited places introduced species for food and the materials they required to survive. It is possible that the process of introduction of mammals to Ireland commenced during the Mesolithic and accelerated with Neolithic people. Irish populations of these long established, introduced species show some unique genetic variation whilst retaining traces of their origins principally from Britain but in some cases, Scandinavia and Iberia. It is of particular interest that they may retain genetic forms now absent from their source populations. Further species introductions, during the Bronze and late Iron Ages, and Viking and Norman invasions, follow the same pattern but lack the time for genetic divergence from their source populations. Accidental introductions of commensal species show considerable genetic diversity based on numerous translocations along the eastern Atlantic coastline. More recent accidental and deliberate introductions are characterised by a lack of genetic diversity other than that explicable by more than one introduction.
   The substantial advances in understanding the postglacial origins and genetic diversity of British and Irish mammals, the role of early people in species translocations, and determination of species that are more recently introduced, should inform policy decisions with regards to species and genetic conservation. Conservation should prioritise early, naturally recolonizing species and those brought in by early people reflecting their long association with these islands. These early arrivals in Britain and Ireland and associated islands show genetic diversity that may be of value in mitigating anthropogenic climate change across Europe. In contrast, more recent introductions are likely to disturb ecosystems greatly, lead to loss of diversity and should be controlled. This challenge is more severe in Ireland where the number and proportion of invasive species from the 19th century to the present has been greater than in Britain. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In many plant species that remain leafless part of the year, CO2 fixation occurring in green stems represents an important carbon gain. Traditionally, a distinction has been made between stem photosynthesis and corticular photosynthesis. All stem photosynthesis is, sensu stricto, cortical, since it is carried out largely by the stem cortex. We proposed the following nomenclature: stem net photosynthesis (SNP), which includes net CO2 fixation by stems with stomata in the epidermis and net corticular CO2 fixation in suberized stems, and stem recycling photosynthesis (SRP), which defines CO2 ling in suberized stems. The proposed terms should reflect differences in anatomical and physiological traits. SNP takes place in the chlorenchyma below the epidermis with stomata, where the net CO2 uptake occurs, and it resembles leaf photosynthesis in many characteristics. SRP is found in species where the chlorenchyma is beneath a well-developed stomata-free periderm and where reassimilation of internally respired CO2 occurs. SNP is common in plants from desert ecosystems, rates reaching up to 60% of the leaf photosynthetic rate. SRP has been demonstrated in trees from temperate forests and it offsets partially a carbon loss by respiration of stem nonphotosynthetic tissues. Reassimilation can vary between 7 and 123% of respired CO2, the latter figure implying net CO2 uptake from the atmosphere. Both types of stem photosynthesis contribute positively to the carbon economy of the species, in which they occur; they are advantageous to the plant because they allow the maintenance of physiological activity during stress, an increase of integrated water use efficiency, and they provide the carbon source used in the production of new organs.

AB Evidence is accumulating that species' responses to climate changes are best predicted by modelling the interaction of physiological limits, biotic processes and the effects of dispersal-limitation. Using commercially harvested blacklip (Haliotis rubra) and greenlip abalone (Haliotis laevigata) as case studies, we determine the relative importance of accounting for interactions among physiology, metapopulation dynamics and exploitation in predictions of range (geographical occupancy) and abundance (spatially explicit density) under various climate change scenarios. Traditional correlative ecological niche models (ENM) predict that climate change will benefit the commercial exploitation of abalone by promoting increased abundances without any reduction in range size. However, models that account simultaneously for demographic processes and physiological responses to climate-related factors result in future (and present) estimates of area of occupancy (AOO) and abundance that differ from those generated by ENMs alone. Range expansion and population growth are unlikely for blacklip abalone because of important interactions between climate-dependent mortality and metapopulation processes; in contrast, greenlip abalone should increase in abundance despite a contraction in AOO. The strongly non-linear relationship between abalone population size and AOO has important ramifications for the use of ENM predictions that rely on metrics describing change in habitat area as proxies for extinction risk. These results show that predicting species' responses to climate change often require physiological information to understand climatic range determinants, and a metapopulation model that can make full use of this data to more realistically account for processes such as local extirpation, demographic rescue, source-sink dynamics and dispersal-limitation.

AB Stenothermal polar benthic marine invertebrates are highly sensitive to environmental perturbations but little is known about potential synergistic effects of concurrent ocean warming and acidification on development of their embryos and larvae. We examined the effects of these stressors on development to the calcifying larval stage in the Antarctic sea urchin Sterechinus neumayeri in embryos reared in present and future (2100+) ocean conditions from fertilization. Embryos were reared in 2 temperature (ambient: -1.0 degrees C, + 2 degrees C:1.0 degrees C) and 3 pH (ambient: pH 8.0, -0.2-0.4 pH units: 7.8,7.6) levels. Principle coordinates analysis on five larval metrics showed a significant effect of temperature and pH on the pattern of growth. Within each temperature, larvae were separated by pH treatment, a pattern primarily influenced by larval arm and body length. Growth was accelerated by temperature with a 20-28% increase in postoral (PO) length at +2 degrees C across all pH levels. Growth was strongly depressed by reduced pH with a 8-19% decrease in PO length at pH 7.6-7.8 at both temperatures. The boost in growth caused by warming resulted in larvae that were larger than would be observed if acidification was examined in the absence of warming. However, there was no significant interaction between these stressors. The increase in left-right asymmetry and altered body allometry indicated that decreased pH disrupted developmental patterning and acted as a teratogen (agent causing developmental malformation). Decreased developmental success with just a 2 degrees C warming indicates that development in S. neumayeri is particularly sensitive to increased temperature. Increased temperature also altered larval allometry. Altered body shape impairs swimming and feeding in echinoplutei. In the absence of adaptation, it appears that the larval phase may be a bottleneck for survivorship of S. neumayeri in a changing ocean in a location where poleward migration to escape inhospitable conditions is not possible.

AB The Neotropics harbors a high diversity of species and several hypotheses have been proposed to account for this pattern. However, while species of forested domains are frequently studied, less is known of species from open vegetation formations occupying, altogether, a larger area than the Amazon Forest. Here we evaluate the role of historical barriers and the riverine hypothesis in the speciation patterns of small mammals by analyzing an ancient rodent lineage (Thrichomys, Hystricomorpha). Phylogenetic and biogeographic analyses were carried out with mitochondrial and nuclear DNA markers to analyze the evolutionary relationships between Thrichomys lineages occurring in dry domains along both banks of the Rio Sao Francisco. This river is one of the longest of South America whose course and water flow have been modified by inland tectonic activities and climate changes. Molecular data showed a higher number of lineages than previously described. The T. inermis species complex with 2n = 26, FN = 48 was observed in both banks of the river showing a paraphyletic arrangement, suggesting that river crossing had occurred, from east to west. A similar pattern was also observed for the T. apereoides complex. Thrichomys speciation occurred in Late Miocene when the river followed a different course. The current geographic distribution of Thrichomys species and their phylogenetic relationships suggested the existence of frequent past connections between both banks in the middle section of the Rio Sao Francisco. The extensive palaeodune region found in this area has been identified as a centre of endemism of several vertebrate species and is likely to be a center of Thrichomys diversification.

AB Climate and land use changes are major threats to biodiversity. To preserve biodiversity, networks of protected areas have been established worldwide, like the Natura 2000 network across the European Union (EU). Currently, this reserve network consists of more than 26000 sites covering more than 17% of EU terrestrial territory. Its efficiency to mitigate the detrimental effects of land use and climate change remains an open research question. Here, we examined the potential current and future geographical ranges of four birds of prey under scenarios of both land use and climate changes. By using graph theory, we examined how the current Natura 2000 network will perform in regard to the conservation of these species. This approach determines the importance of a site in regard to the total network and its connectivity. We found that sites becoming unsuitable due to climate change are not a random sample of the network, but are less connected and contribute less to the overall connectivity than the average site and thus their loss does not disrupt the full network. Hence, the connectivity of the remaining network changed only slightly from present day conditions. Our findings highlight the need to establish species-specific management plans with flexible conservation strategies ensuring protection under potential future range expansions. Aquila pomarina is predicted to disappear from the southern part of its range and to become restricted to northeastern Europe. Gyps fulvus, Aquila chrysaetos, and Neophron percnopterus are predicted to locally lose some suitable sites; hence, some isolated small populations may become extinct. However, their geographical range and metapopulation structure will remain relatively unaffected throughout Europe. These species would benefit more from an improved habitat quality and management of the existing network of protected areas than from increased connectivity or assisted migration.

AB Many production landscapes are complex human-environment systems operating at various spatio-temporal scales and provide a variety of ecosystem goods and services (EGS) vital to human well-being. EGS change over space and time as a result of changing patterns of land use or changes in the composition and structure of different vegetation types. Spatio-temporal assessment of EGS can provide valuable information on the consequences of changing land use and land cover for EGS and helps to deal with this complexity. We carried out a quantitative and qualitative appraisal of selected EGS (timber production, carbon stock, provision of water, water regulation, biodiversity, and forage production) to understand how these have altered in a complex mosaic of landscape that has undergone significant change over the past 200 years.
   Land use and land cover types and their associated EGS were assessed and mapped using a wide range of readily available data and tools. We also evaluated the trade-offs among services associated with observed land use change. In contrast to work elsewhere, we found the recent changes in land use and land cover have an overall positive impact on various EGS due mainly to the conversion of pasture to managed plantations which are connected to the larger areas of remnant vegetation. Results also indicate that there was a high level of variation in the distribution of the EGS across the landscape. Relatively intact native vegetation provides mainly regulating services whereas the modified landscapes provides provisioning services such as timber and forage production at the cost of regulating services. Rapidly changing demand and supply of certain goods and services (e.g., timber, pulp or carbon) may also have positive and negative impact on other services. For example, increasing plantation rotation has positive impacts for biodiversity and carbon stock but reduces stream flow and water yield. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

DE Ecological risk assessment; Ecosystem services; Indicator selection;

AB This paper describes scientific developments that have raised awareness that changes in ecological risk assessment (ERA) methods are necessary. These changes have also been triggered by developments in environmental policies. This is illustrated by examples for The Netherlands and Europe. The ecosystem services concept seems to gain a central role in developments of new ERA methods. Main reasons for this are the integrative character of the concept, making it possible to integrate over environmental compartments or over environmental assessment methods, the concept's strength as communication tool and the possibility to value ecosystem services in economic terms. A method using ecosystem services in ERA is presented here in more detail, as an example. In this method assessment endpoints are derived from structures and processes in the ecosystem that are considered indispensable for the provision of particular ecosystem services. The approach facilitates fine-tuning ERA to specific land use demands. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Although high elevation meadows are often considered to be primarily temperature-limited, aboveground net primary production (ANPP) is influenced by both growing season length (GSL) and soil moisture (SM). Progress in understanding these responses comes from studies at individual sites that are often focused on single abiotic drivers, so little is known about how climatic constraints relate to one another and limit ANPP at larger scales. We examined the independent and combined effects of these two key climate drivers (GSL and SM) across a suite of high elevation meadows from two continents. We also sampled gradients of each variable at a single site to explore mechanisms for SM and GSL limitations. Here, we show that high elevation meadows are limited by both GSL and SM levels. GSL constrained maximum ANPP by approximately 4 g m(-2) d(-1) whereas average daily ANPP beneath this constraint was significantly influenced by SM. Carbon isotope and plant/soil nitrogen data suggest that SM influenced ANPP through its impact on nitrogen availability. Increases in GSL can increase ANPP unless those increases are accompanied by SM decreases. These interactive effects can produce distinct ecological patterns and must be considered when predicting high elevation meadow responses to future climate changes.

AB Background: Changes in plant diversity may induce distinct changes in soil food web structure and accompanying soil feedbacks to plants. However, knowledge of the long-term consequences of plant community simplification for soil animal food webs and functioning is scarce. Nematodes, the most abundant and diverse soil Metazoa, represent the complexity of soil food webs as they comprise all major trophic groups and allow calculation of a number of functional indices.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: We studied the functional composition of nematode communities three and five years after establishment of a grassland plant diversity experiment (Jena Experiment). In response to plant community simplification common nematode species disappeared and pronounced functional shifts in community structure occurred. The relevance of the fungal energy channel was higher in spring 2007 than in autumn 2005, particularly in species-rich plant assemblages. This resulted in a significant positive relationship between plant species richness and the ratio of fungal-to-bacterial feeders. Moreover, the density of predators increased significantly with plant diversity after five years, pointing to increased soil food web complexity in species-rich plant assemblages. Remarkably, in complex plant communities the nematode community shifted in favour of microbivores and predators, thereby reducing the relative abundance of plant feeders after five years.
   Conclusions/Significance: The results suggest that species-poor plant assemblages may suffer from nematode communities detrimental to plants, whereas species-rich plant assemblages support a higher proportion of microbivorous nematodes stimulating nutrient cycling and hence plant performance; i.e. effects of nematodes on plants may switch from negative to positive. Overall, food web complexity is likely to decrease in response to plant community simplification and results of this study suggest that this results mainly from the loss of common species which likely alter plant - nematode interactions.

AB Background: In soils with a low phosphorus (P) supply, sugar beet is known to intake more P than other species such as maize, wheat, or groundnut. We hypothesized that organic compounds exuded by sugar beet roots solubilize soil P and that this exudation is stimulated by P starvation.
   Results: Root exudates were collected from plants grown in hydroponics under low-and high-P availability. Exudate components were separated by HPLC, ionized by electrospray, and detected by mass spectrometry in the range of mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) from 100 to 1000. Eight mass spectrometric signals were enhanced at least 5-fold by low P availability at all harvest times. Among these signals, negative ions with an m/z of 137 and 147 were shown to originate from salicylic acid and citramalic acid. The ability of both compounds to mobilize soil P was demonstrated by incubation of pure substances with Oxisol soil fertilized with calcium phosphate.
   Conclusions: Root exudates of sugar beet contain salicylic acid and citramalic acid, the latter of which has rarely been detected in plants so far. Both metabolites solubilize soil P and their exudation by roots is stimulated by P deficiency. These results provide the first assignment of a biological function to citramalic acid of plant origin.

   We evaluated Odonata distribution data and predicted the compositional resemblance based on niche-based species distribution models to analyse the following questions: (1) How is estimated species richness distributed, and how can it be preserved under the actual network of conservation units (a gap analysis approach)? (2) How is the estimated odonate beta diversity distributed, and is there a better distribution of conservation units (a priority setting approach)? (3) Is the probability of being under protection a function of the potential species range size? and (4) Will the current conservation network proposals protect odonate taxa?
   Location
   Central Brazil in a core Cerrado area.
   Methods
   We generated odonate species distribution predictions based on MaxEnt and maps derived from estimated species richness, beta diversity and gap analysis for all species predicted to occur in the study area. Then, we compared these maps with current conservation units, land-use patterns and proposals for the establishment of conservation units.
   Results
   Raw odonate species records provided limited utility for setting conservation priorities without the use of niche-based models. However, area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) values were characterized by substantial variation that was related to the number of records. No current conservation units overlapped the areas with higher predicted richness and beta diversity, and in general, conservation units were not preserving restricted/rare species. There was a direct linear correlation between species range size and the proportion of its range protected in the current network of conservation units. Finally, we identified three areas with high odonate beta diversity where conservationist actions should be implemented.
   Main conclusions
   Current conservation units and future suggested areas do not overlap regions with high conservation values for odonates. Conservation units protect species at random, and the level of protection has a direct relationship with species range size; thus, wide-range species are expected to be more protected than restricted or threatened species.

AB Warming of the planet has accelerated in recent years and is predicted to continue over the next century. Environmental consequences include increasing water temperatures, and evidence of ecological responses to current warming in marine coastal ecosystems is found in poleward shifts in the geographic range of species as well as changes in the composition of nearshore benthic communities. Most evidence has, however, been obtained from intertidal studies, but similar shifts should be occurring for subtidal communities as well, especially for the ecologically important kelp species that provide both food and shelter to a multitude of organisms. Kelp may be particularly vulnerable to climate change due to their cold-water affinities and limited dispersal ability. A major biogeographic transition occurs along northwest Atlantic shores of Canada between subarctic and boreal zones where major shifts can be seen in the composition of kelp assemblages of Alaria esculenta, Laminaria digitata, Saccharina longicruris and Saccharina latissima. Here we review the historic and recent distribution and abundance of these species and find no evidence of changes in the past century. However, sparse coverage of data, inconsistent methodology and a lack of adequate time series prevent us from concluding that no changes have occurred, especially with respect to natural variation and anthropogenic alteration. These shortcomings illustrate the need for identifying sentinel species and sites for studies dedicated to the specific questions of climate-induced changes in kelp abundance and distribution. We suggest that a combination of traditional and modern tools (e.g., benthic surveys and climate model forecasting, respectively) offers the best path forward. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB 'Hamlin' sweet orange trees on 'Carrizo' citrange and 'Swingle' citrumelo rootstocks were treated weekly with a commercial extract of the brown seaweed Ascophyllum nodosum at 5 and 10 mL.L-1 as either a soil drench or foliar spray. Half of the trees in each treatment were subjected to drought stress [irrigated at 50% of evapotranspiration (ET)], whereas the other half remained fully irrigated (100% ET). Drought stress reduced shoot growth and leaf photosynthesis but increased root and total plant growth relative to the amount of water applied, thus increasing whole plant water use efficiency. Trees treated with seaweed extract and drought-stressed had significantly more total growth than untreated drought-stressed trees for both rootstocks. The maintenance of growth by the seaweed extract under drought stress conditions was unrelated to photosynthesis. However, the seaweed extract treatment did have a significant effect on plant water relations. Soil drench-treated trees had more growth and higher stem water potential than foliar-treated or control trees after 8 weeks of drought stress. These results indicate that seaweed extract may be a useful tool for improving drought stress tolerance of container-grown citrus trees.

AB Quaternary glacial-interglacial cycles repeatedly forced thermal zones up and down the slopes of mountains, at all latitudes. Although no one doubts that these temperature cycles have left their signature on contemporary patterns of geography and phylogeny, the relative roles of ecology and evolution are not well understood, especially for the tropics. To explore key mechanisms and their interactions in the context of chance events, we constructed a geographical range-based, stochastic simulation model that incorporates speciation, anagenetic evolution, niche conservatism, range shifts and extinctions under late Quaternary temperature cycles along tropical elevational gradients. In the model, elevational patterns of species richness arise from the differential survival of founder lineages, consolidated by speciation and the inheritance of thermal niche characteristics. The model yields a surprisingly rich variety of realistic patterns of phylogeny and biogeography, including close matches to a variety of contemporary elevational richness profiles from an elevational transect in Costa Rica. Mountaintop extinctions during interglacials and lowland extinctions at glacial maxima favour mid-elevation lineages, especially under the constraints of niche conservatism. Asymmetry in temperature (greater duration of glacial than of interglacial episodes) and in lateral area (greater land area at low than at high elevations) have opposing effects on lowland extinctions and the elevational pattern of species richness in the model-and perhaps in nature, as well.

AB Boreal forests store a large fraction of global terrestrial carbon and are susceptible to environmental change, particularly rising temperatures and increased fire frequency. These changes have the potential to drive positive feedbacks between climate warming and the boreal carbon cycle. Because few studies have examined the warming response of boreal ecosystems recovering from fire, we established a greenhouse warming experiment near Delta Junction, Alaska, seven years after a 1999 wildfire. We hypothesized that experimental warming would increase soil CO2 efflux, stimulate nutrient mineralization, and alter the composition and function of soil fungal communities. Although our treatment resulted in 1.20 degrees C soil warming, we found little support for our hypothesis. Only the activities of cellulose- and chitin-degrading enzymes increased significantly by 15% and 35%, respectively, and there were no changes in soil fungal communities. Warming resulted in drier soils, but the corresponding change in soil water potential was probably not sufficient to limit microbial activity. Rather, the warming response of this soil may be constrained by depletion of labile carbon substrates resulting from combustion and elevated soil temperatures in the years after the 1999 fire. We conclude that positive feedbacks between warming and the microbial release of soil carbon are weak in boreal ecosystems lacking permafrost. Since permafrost-free soils underlie 45-60% of the boreal zone, our results should be useful for modeling the warming response during recovery from fire in a large fraction of the boreal forest.

AB Ecological surveys of tropical tree communities have provided an important source of data to study the forces that generate and maintain tropical diversity. Accurate species identification is central to these studies. Incorrect lumping or splitting of species will distort results, which may in turn affect conclusions. Although ecologists often work with taxonomists, they likely make some identification errors. This is because most trees encountered in the field are not reproductive and must be identified using vegetative characters, while most species descriptions rely on fruit and flower characters. Because every tree has DNA, ecological surveys can incorporate molecular approaches to enhance accuracy. This study reports an extensive ecological and molecular survey of nearly 4000 trees belonging to 55 species in the tree genus Insta (Fabaceae). These trees were sampled in 25 community surveys in the southwestern Amazon. In a process of reciprocal illumination, trees were first identified to species using vegetative characters, and these identifications were revised using phylogenies derived from nuclear and chloroplast DNA sequences.
   We next evaluated the effects of these revised species counts upon analyses often used to assess ecological neutral theory. The most common morphological identification errors involved incorrectly splitting rare morphological variants of common species and incorrectly lumping geographically segregated, morphologically similar species. Total error rates were significant (6.8-7.6% of all individuals) and had a measurable impact on ecological analyses. The revised identifications increased support for spatially autocorrelated, potentially neutral factors in determining community composition. Nevertheless, the general conclusions of community-level ecological analyses were robust to misidentifications. Ecological factors, such as soil composition, and potentially neutral factors, such as dispersal limitation, both play important roles in the assembly of Inga communities. In contrast, species-level analyses of neutrality with respect to habitat were strongly impacted by identification errors. Although this study found errors in morphological identifications, there was also strong evidence that a purely molecular approach to species identification, such as DNA barcoding, would be prone to substantial errors. The greatest accuracy in ecological surveys will be obtained through a synthesis of traditional, morphological and modern, molecular approaches.

AB Background: The dynamic geological and climatic histories of temperate South America have played important roles in shaping the contemporary distributions and genetic diversity of endemic freshwater species. We use mitochondria and nuclear sequence variation to investigate the consequences of mountain barriers and Quaternary glacial cycles for patterns of genetic diversity in the diadromous fish Galaxias maculatus in Patagonia (similar to 300 individuals from 36 locations).
   Results: Contemporary populations of G. maculatus, east and west of the Andes in Patagonia, represent a single monophyletic lineage comprising several well supported groups. Mantel tests using control region data revealed a strong positive relationship when geographic distance was modeled according to a scenario of marine dispersal. (r = 0.69, P = 0.055). By contrast, direct distance between regions was poorly correlated with genetic distance (r = -0.05, P = 0.463). Hierarchical AMOVAs using mtDNA revealed that pooling samples according to historical (pre-LGM) oceanic drainage (Pacific vs. Atlantic) explained approximately four times more variance than pooling them into present-day drainage (15.6% vs. 3.7%). Further post-hoc AMOVA tests revealed additional genetic structure between populations east and west of the Chilean Coastal Cordillera (coastal vs. interior). Overall female effective population size appears to have remained relatively constant until roughly 0.5 Ma when population size rapidly increased several orders of magnitude [100x (60x-190x)] to reach contemporary levels. Maximum likelihood analysis of nuclear alleles revealed a poorly supported gene tree which was paraphyletic with respect to mitochondrial-defined haplogroups.
   Conclusions: First diversifying in the central/north-west region of Patagonia, G. maculatus extended its range into Argentina via the southern coastal regions that join the Pacific and Atlantic oceans. More recent gene flow between northern populations involved the most ancient and most derived lineages, and was likely facilitated by drainage reversal(s) during one or more cooling events of the late Pleistocene. Overall female effective population size represents the end result of a widespread and several hundred-fold increase over approximately 0.5 Ma, spanning several climatic fluctuations of the Pleistocene. The minor influence of glacial cycles on the genetic structure and diversity of G. maculatus likely reflects the access to marine refugia during repeated bouts of global cooling. Evidence of genetic structure that was detected on a finer scale between lakes/rivers is most likely the result of both biological attributes (i.e., resident non-migratory behavior and/or landlocking and natal homing in diadromous populations), and the Coastal Cordillera as a dispersal barrier.

TI Effect of foliar application of antitranspirant on photosynthesis and

AB Strategies such as foliar application of antitranspirants have the potential to regulate transpiration, but often, the limitation of CO2 exchange as a result of reduced stomatal conductance can impair this beneficial effect. Elevated ambient [CO2] could significantly improve CO2 diffusion while effectively reducing transpiration. In this experiment, we examined the response of sweet pepper (Capsicum annuum L) to the foliar application of antitranspirant (AT) under two [CO2] (380 and 2000 mu mol mol(-1)) and two drought intensities (4 or 8 d without irrigation). The results showed that stomatal conductance and transpiration were reduced, while AT impaired photosynthesis at standard, but not at elevated [CO2] of fully irrigated plants. This effect was already apparent after 4d of drought. Drought had a minor impact on chlorophyll fluorescence (F-v/F-m). Additionally, root respiration was increased at elevated [CO2] but, after 8 d of drought, it was higher for plants treated with AT than for non-sprayed plants. Leaf water potential was affected more by drought at ambient compared to elevated [CO2], and, especially after 8 d of drought, AT minimized the reductions in leaf water potential. Leaf concentrations of proline and starch were affected by both [CO2] and AT, especially after 8d of drought. Moreover, increasing [CO2] promoted the accumulation of starch, but led to decreases in the tissue concentrations of the soluble organic osmolytes, and hence diminished osmotic adjustment after 8 d of water withholding, relative to ambient [CO2]. This study indicates that, in addition to the reported beneficial effect of elevated [CO2] on drought stress, AT could significantly improve drought tolerance in sweet pepper plants.

AB Recent reviews of the conservation literature indicate that significant biases exist in the published literature regarding the regions, ecosystems and species that have been examined by researchers. Despite the global threat of climatic change, similar biases may be occurring within the sub-discipline of climate-change ecology. Here we hope to foster critical thought and discussion by considering the directions taken by conservation researchers when addressing climate change. To form a quantitative basis for our perspective, we assessed 248 papers from the climate change literature that considered the conservation management of biodiversity and ecosystems. We found that roughly half of the studies considered climate change in isolation from other threatening processes. We also found that the majority of surveyed scientific publications were conducted in the temperate forests of Europe and North America. Regions such as Latin America that are rich in biodiversity but may have low adaptive capacity to climate change were not well represented. We caution that such biases in research effort may be distracting our attention away from vulnerable regions, ecosystems and species. Specifically we suggest that the under-representation of research from regions low in adaptive capacity and rich in biodiversity requires international collaboration by those experienced in climate-change research, with researchers from less wealthy nations who are familiar with local issues, ecosystems and species. Furthermore, we caution that the propensity of ecologists to work in essentially unmodified ecosystems may fundamentally hamper our ability to make useful recommendations in a world that is experiencing significant global change.

AB Apomixis, a natural form of asexual seed production in plants, has evolved independently in various taxa, and represents an important potential technology for agriculture. The switch to apomixis is based on de-regulation of developmental pathways originally leading to sexual seed formation. Hybridization and polyploidy, both typical characteristics of asexual plants and animals, are mechanisms that could trigger de-regulation. Here we show that up-regulation of alleles in apomeiotic ovules is mediated by genomic duplication, heterochrony and the residual effects of ancient hybridization in diploid apomicts of the Boechera holboellii complex. Using SuperSAGE, we have identified over 4000 differentially expressed mRNA tags between micro-dissected ovules from two diploid sexual (Boechera stricta and B. holboellu) and two diploid apomictic (Boechera divaricarpa) accessions. Pairwise sequence comparisons between tags enabled identification of allelic variants of the same loci. Up-regulated candidate apomeiosis alleles consistently have more than three related alleles, thus demonstrating transcription from duplicated loci. A further 543 alleles were heterochronically expressed between sexual and apomeiotic ovules at developmental stages 2-II to 2-IV. Intriguingly, 69 B. holboellii specific alleles were preferentially up-regulated in apomeiotic ovules, thus showing a remnant 'parent of origin' effect stemming from the Pleistocene origin of the hybrid B. divaricarpa from taxa related to B. holboellii and B. stricta. These data implicate polyploid gene dosage in the expression of asexual seed formation, and support hypotheses of de-regulation of the sexual pathway. The observed 'parent of origin' effect suggests that the genomic memory of hybridization has somehow been maintained after hundreds, if not thousands, of asexual generations.

AB Recent studies have revealed high local diversity and endemism in groundwaters, and showed that species with large ranges are extremely rare. One of such species is the cave shrimp Troglocaris anophthalmus from the Dinaric Karst on the western Balkan Peninsula, apparently uniform across a range of more than 500 kilometres. As such it contradicts the paradigm that subterranean organisms form localized, long-term stable populations that cannot disperse over long distances. We tested it for possible cryptic diversity and/or unexpected evolutionary processes, analysing mitochondrial (COI, 16S rRNA) and nuclear (ITS2) genes of 232 specimens from the entire range. The results of an array of phylogeographical procedures congruently suggested that the picture of a widespread, continuously distributed and homogenous T. anophthalmus was wrong. The taxon is composed of four or possibly five monophyletic, geographically defined phylogroups that meet several species delimitation criteria, two of them showing evidence of biological reproductive isolation in sympatry. COI genetic distances between phylogroups turned out to be a poor predictor, as they were much lower than the sometimes suggested crustacean threshold value of 0.16 substitutions per site. Most results confirmed the nondispersal hypothesis of subterranean fauna, but the southern Adriatic phylogroup displayed a paradoxical pattern of recent dispersal across 300 kilometres of hydrographically fragmented karst terrain. We suggest a model of migration under extreme water-level conditions, when flooded poljes could act as stepping-stones. In the north of the range (Slovenia), the results confirmed the existence of a zone of unique biogeographical conflict, where surface fauna is concordant with the current watershed, and subterranean fauna is not.

AB The effects of habitat fragmentation on species may change seasonally mainly due to variations in resource availability and biotic interactions. In critical periods, such as winter, when the importance of intraspecific competition diminish, species may relax their environmental requirements widening their ecological niche to exploit the scarcer trophic resources more efficiently in comparison with spring. Those variations in niche width may implicate seasonal expansions/retractions in species distribution. In this sense, an integrated knowledge on the spatial arrangement of breeding and wintering suitable patches is essential to infer seasonal movements (migratory connectivity). This paper shows that little bustard environmental preferences were more predictable and complex (controlled by a larger number of environmental factors) in spring than in winter, when potential distribution and ecological niche width were slightly larger. In spring, habitat variables (i.e. percentage of dry crops and pasturelands and altitude) ruled species' distribution,while, winter pattern was driven by mixed criteria, based on both habitat and climate (i.e. percentage of dry crops and wastelands and winter rainfall). Suitable patches were more connected across spatial scales in winter than in spring, i.e. landscape was perceived as less fragmented. The overlap between potential breeding and wintering distribution areas was high. In fact, most of the predicted wintering areas coincided or showed high connectedness with predicted breeding patches. Conversely, there were significant breeding patches that were predicted with low suitability, showing little connectedness with potential winter areas. Spring habitat was a better predictor of little bustard's wintering range than vice versa, which has clear management implications (preserving breeding sites closer to wintering areas ensures the conservation of a larger proportion of the total distribution range). This is an example of how predictive large-scale modeling procedures can contribute to the optimization of land management aimed at species conservation. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.

AB Recent speciation events provide important insights into the understanding and conservation of Earth's biodiversity, representing recent adaptations to a changing environment and an important source of future evolutionary potential. However, the most frequently applied criterion for molecular-based speciation investigations, that of reciprocal monophyly of mitochondrial sequences, overlooks recent speciation events where insufficient time has passed for fixed molecular differences to develop between putative species. Two morphologically distinguishable forms of finless porpoise ( genus Neophocaena) exist in sympatry in the strait of Taiwan, however the taxonomic relationship of these different forms is controversial. To test the hypothesis that the two forms represent different species, a study was conducted based on morphological characters and microsatellite and mitochondrial markers. The data suggest that the two forms are highly differentiated in terms of both morphology and genetic characteristics, despite being sympatric, and therefore represent different species as defined by the biological species concept. Moreover, the two forms appear to have been reproductively isolated since sharing a common ancestor prior to the last major glaciation event similar to 18 000 years ago. However, this represents an insufficient amount of time for reciprocal monophyly to have developed, and thus previous studies based on this criterion have overlooked this speciation event and resulted in incorrect taxonomic classification of these forms.

AB 1. Similar constraints in distant, but climatically comparable, regions may be expected to yield biotic assemblages with similar attributes. Environmental factors that constrain communities at smaller scales, however, may be different between climatically similar regions. Thus, patterns observed at large scales may differ from those detected at small scales, and international comparisons should be focussed at multiple scales.
   2. Mediterranean-climate regions (MCRs) are characterized by remarkable seasonal variability in precipitation and temperature. Accordingly, rivers in these regions have seasonal and predictable floods and droughts, and temporary reaches are frequent. Present in six geographical regions of the world, MCRs have similar environmental constraints and are ideal for testing intercontinental similarities between macroinvertebrate communities.
   3. We examined aquatic macroinvertebrate taxon richness and composition in MCRs at three scales: regional, reach and macrohabitat. At the regional scale, the Mediterranean Basin had the highest taxon richness at family level, and southwestern Australia the lowest. Taxonomic composition showed c. 85% similarity between the northern hemisphere MCRs of California and the Mediterranean Basin, which were followed in similarity by South Africa. The two Australian MCRs (South west and South) showed a similarity to each other of about 70% whereas the Chilean fauna was the most distinct.
   4. At the reach scale, taxon richness was not significantly different between permanent and temporary reaches in any MCR, whereas taxonomic composition was significantly different among northern hemisphere MCRs. At the macrohabitat scale, taxon richness was not significantly different between lotic and lentic macrohabitats within any of the MCRs, but differences in macroinvertebrate communities were found between macrohabitats when considering regions.
   5. Our results show that the strength of similarity between distant but climatically similar regions is scale-dependent, being highest at the macrohabitat scale. Although the similarities in richness and composition at the macrohabitat scale are presumed to be universal, the seasonal predictability of drought in MCRs is expected to result in characteristic macroinvertebrate responses at the reach scale. We suggest, however, that regional evolutionary history and environmental characteristics may override this general pattern of a similar response of MCRs at different scales. The Mediterranean Basin and California, having similar historical and environmental condition, thus appeared as the most similar MCRs at all scales.

AB According to the exploitation ecosystems hypothesis (EEH), productive terrestrial ecosystems are characterized by community-level trophic cascades, whereas unproductive ecosystems harbor food-limited grazers, which regulate community-level plant biomass. We tested this hypothesis along arctic-alpine productivity gradients at the Joatka field base, Finnmark, Norway. In unproductive habitats, mammalian predators were absent and plant biomass was constant, whereas herbivore biomass varied, reflecting the productivity of the habitat. In productive habitats, predatory mammals were persistently present and plant biomass varied in space, but herbivore biomass did not. Plant biomass of productive tundra scrublands declined by 40% when vegetation blocks were transferred to predation-free islands. Corresponding transfer to herbivore-free islands triggered an increase in plant biomass. Fertilization of an unproductive tundra heath resulted in a fourfold increase in rodent density and a corresponding increase in winter grazing activity, whereas the total aboveground plant biomass remained unchanged. These results corroborate the predictions of the EEH, implying that the endotherm community and the vegetation of the North European tundra behaves dynamically as if each trophic level consisted of a single population, in spite of local co-occurrence of > 20 plant species representing different major taxonomic groups, growth forms, and defensive strategies.

   reef sponge Leucetta chagosensis (Leucettidae): Founder effects,
   vicariance, or both?

   DIVERSIFICATION
AB Background: An increasing number of studies demonstrate that genetic differentiation and speciation in the sea occur over much smaller spatial scales than previously appreciated given the wide distribution range of many morphologically defined coral reef invertebrate species and the presumed dispersal-enhancing qualities of ocean currents. However, knowledge about the processes that lead to population divergence and speciation is often lacking despite being essential for the understanding, conservation, and management of marine biodiversity. Sponges, a highly diverse, ecologically and economically important reef-invertebrate taxon, exhibit spatial trends in the Indo-West Pacific that are not universally reflected in other marine phyla. So far, however, processes generating those unexpected patterns are not understood.
   Results: We unraveled the phylogeographic structure of the widespread Indo-Pacific coral reef sponge Leucetta chagosensis across its known geographic range using two nuclear markers: the rDNA internal transcribed spacers (ITS 1&2) and a fragment of the 28S gene, as well as the second intron of the ATP synthetase beta subunit-gene (ATPSb-iII). This enabled the detection of several deeply divergent clades congruent over both loci, one containing specimens from the Indian Ocean ( Red Sea and Maldives), another one from the Philippines, and two other large and substructured NW Pacific and SW Pacific clades with an area of overlap in the Great Barrier Reef/Coral Sea. Reciprocally monophyletic populations were observed from the Philippines, Red Sea, Maldives, Japan, Samoa, and Polynesia, demonstrating long-standing isolation. Populations along the South Equatorial Current in the south-western Pacific showed isolation-by-distance effects. Overall, the results pointed towards stepping-stone dispersal with some putative long-distance exchange, consistent with expectations from low dispersal capabilities.
   Conclusion: We argue that both founder and vicariance events during the late Pliocene and Pleistocene were responsible to varying degrees for generating the deep phylogeographic structure. This structure was perpetuated largely as a result of the life history of L. chagosensis, resulting in high levels of regional isolation. Reciprocally monophyletic populations constitute putative sibling ( cryptic) species, while population para- and polyphyly may indicate incipient speciation processes. The genetic diversity and biodiversity of tropical Indo-Pacific sponges appears to be substantially underestimated since the high level of genetic divergence is not necessarily manifested at the morphological level.

AB We analyze the contribution of ecosystem services to GDP and use this contribution to calculate an empirical price for ecosystem services. Net primary production is used as a proxy for ecosystem services and, along with capital and labor, is used to estimate a Cobb Douglas production function from an international panel. A positive output elasticity for net primary production probably measures both marketed and nonmarketed contributions of ecosystems services. The production function is used to calculate the marginal product of net primary production, which is the shadow price for ecosystem services. The shadow price generally is greatest for developed nations, which have larger technical scalars and use less net primary production per unit output. The rate of technical substitution indicates that the quantity of capital needed to replace a unit of net primary production tends to increase with economic development, and this rate of replacement may ultimately constrain economic growth.

AB Aim We investigated geographical variation in the density of the red fox in relation to climatic variables, habitat productivity and seasonality to identify those factors that were the best predictors of fox density.
   Location Published data on red fox abundance were collated from 69 locations over Europe and Asia.
   Methods Using generalized linear models and the information-theoretic approach, we analysed the contribution of climatic measures (winter and summer temperature, mean snow depth and duration), primary productivity and seasonality indices [based on the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation (FPAR) index] to account for variation in red fox density.
   Results Red fox density in winter ranged from 0.001-2.8 individuals km(-2); the average density was 0.21 individuals km(-2). Variation in red fox density was best explained by the winter temperature and seasonality. Density decreased with declining winter and summer temperatures, increasing degree of seasonality and increasing duration of snow cover. There was no relationship with habitat productivity.
   Main conclusions Our results indicate that winter climatic conditions and seasonality, but not habitat productivity, may limit red fox density in Eurasia. One explanation for the limitation of the red fox population may be the fox's physiological capability to cope with abiotic conditions. Concurrently, the severity of winter may lead to reduced availability of the fox's prey. That, together with a shorter reproductive period may result in lower reproductive output as well as lower survival of adults and cubs.

AB Over 70% of North American freshwater mussel species (families Unionidae and Margaritiferidae) are listed as threatened or endangered. Knowledge of the genetic structure of target species is essential for the development of effective conservation plans. Because Ambelma plicata is a common species, its population genetic structure is likely to be relatively intact, making it a logical model species for investigations of freshwater mussel population genetics. Using mtDNA and allozymes, we determined the genotypes of 170+ individuals in each of three distinct drainages: Lake Erie, Ohio River, and the Lower Mississippi River. Overall, within-population variation increased significantly from north to south, with unique haplotypes and allele frequencies in the Kiamichi River (Lower Mississippi River drainage). Genetic diversity was relatively low in the Strawberry River (Lower Mississippi River drainage), and in the Lake Erie drainage. We calculated significant among-population structure using both molecular markers (A.p. Phi(st) = 0.15, theta(st) = 0.12). Using a hierarchical approach, we found low genetic structure among rivers and drainages separated by large geographic distances, indicating high effective population size and/or highly vagile fish hosts for this species. Genetic structure in the Lake Erie drainage was similar to that in the Ohio River, and indicates that northern populations were founded from at least two glacial refugia following the Pleistocene. Conservation of genetic diversity in Amblema plicata and other mussel species with similar genetic structure should focus on protection of a number of individual populations, especially those in southern rivers.

AB Temperature acclimation of soil organic matter (SOM) decomposition is one of the major uncertainties in predicting soil CO2 efflux associated with the increase in global mean temperature. A reasonable explanation for an apparent acclimation proposed by Davidson and colleagues (2006) based on Michaelis-Menten kinetics suggests that temperature sensitivity decreases when both maximal activity of respiratory enzymes (V-max) and half-saturation constant (K-s) cancel each other upon temperature increase. We tested the hypothesis of the canceling effect by the mathematical simulation of data obtained in incubation experiments with forest and arable soils. Our data support the hypothesis and suggest that concentration of readily decomposable C substrate (as glucose equivalents) and temperature dependent substrate release are the important factors controlling temperature sensitivity of soil respiration. The highest temperature sensitivity of soil respiration was observed when substrate release was temperature dependent and C substrate concentration was much lower than K-s. Increase of substrate content to the half-saturation constant by glucose addition resulted in temperature acclimation associated with the canceling effect. Addition of the substrate to the level providing respiration at a maximal rate V-max leads to the acclimation of the whole microbial community as such. However, growing microbial biomass was more sensitive to the temperature alterations. This study improves our understanding of the instability of temperature sensitivity of soil respiration under field conditions, attributing this phenomenon to changes in concentration of readily decomposable C substrate.

AB Both local and regional filters can determine the invasion of alien species into native plant communities. However, their relative importance is essentially unknown. We used plot data from fragments of indigenous forests in southeastern New Zealand to infer which factors are important in explaining invasibility, measured as alien species richness. Twenty-eight predictor variables comprising both local factors (stand structure and soil) and regional ones (climate and land cover) were assessed. Reduction or increase in deviance in linear models was assessed, both individually and with a forward and backward stepwise variable selection procedure using the Akaike information criterion (AIC).
   We found that higher alien species richness was mainly associated with forest fragments of small area in warm and dry climates and where there were only small areas of surrounding indigenous forest. Local soil and stand structure variables had considerably smaller effects on alien species richness than the regional land cover and climate variables. Alien species richness showed no relationship with native species richness. We conclude that in the forest fragments investigated here, of the variables included in the analyses, regional land cover and climate variables are potentially important drivers for alien species richness at plot level. This has implications for projections of alien species spread in the future under different climate change and land use scenarios.

AB The true thrushes (Passeriformes: Muscicapidae, subfamily Turdinae) are a speciose and widespread avian lineage presumed to be of Old World origin. Phylogenetic relationships within this assemblage were investigated using mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequence data that included the cytochrome b and ND2 genes. Our ingroup sampling included 54 species representing 17 of 20 putative turdine genera. Phylogenetic trees derived via maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood were largely congruent. Most of the Turdine taxa sampled can be placed into one of six well supported clades. Our data indicate a polyphyletic Zoothera which can be divided into at least two (Afro-Asian and Austral-Asian) main clades. The genus Turdus, as presently recognized, is paraphyletic but forms a well supported clade with the addition of three mostly monotypic genera (Platycichla, Nesocichla, and Cichlherminia). We identify an exclusively New World clade that includes a monophyletic Catharus, Hylocichla, Cichlopsis, Entomodestes, Ridgwayia, and Ixoreus. Members of the morphologically and behaviorally distinct genera Sialia, Myadestes, and Neocossyphus unexpectedly form a basal clade. Using multiple outgroup choices, we show that this group is distantly related, but unequivocally the sister group to the remaining Turdines sampled. The Turdinae appear to be a relatively old songbird lineage, originating in the mid to late Miocene. If the Turdinae are indeed Old World in origin, our data indicate a minimum of three separate invasions of the New World. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Here we investigated photosynthetic traits of evergreen species under a deciduous canopy in a temperate forest and revealed the importance of CO, assimilation during winter for annual CO, assimilation.
   Saplings were shaded by the canopy trees from spring through to autumn, but were less shaded during the winter months. Photosynthetic rates at light saturation (A(area)) were lower during winter than during the growing season. A(area) was higher in Camellia, flex and Photinia than in Castanopsis, Cleyera and Quercus during the winter, but differed little during summer and autumn.
   Estimated daily CO2 assimilation (A(day)) was higher during the winter than during the growing season in Camellia, flex and Photinia but was higher than that during the growing season only at the beginning and end of winter in Castanopsis, Cleyera and Quercus. Aday was higher in Camellia, Ilex and Photinia than in Castanopsis, Cleyera and Quercus but differed little among them during the growing season.
   These results reveal the importance of winter CO2 assimilation for the growth of Camellia, flex and Photinia. Furthermore, differences in annual CO2 assimilation among species are strongly modified by species-specific photosynthetic traits during the winter under deciduous canopy trees.

AB Using museum specimens, we studied temporal changes in skull size in two species of Japanese rodents, the large Japanese field mouse (Apodemus speciosus) and Pratt's vole (Eothenomys smithii = E. kageus) during the 20th century. We used the greatest length of the skull (GTL), zygomatic breadth (ZB), narrowest width of the skull across the interorbital region (IC) and the length of the upper cheek teeth row (M) as indicators to such changes. We found that GTL and ZB (but not IC and M) increased during the study period in mice, and that IC and M (but not GTL and ZB) increased marginally in voles. We attribute these changes to elevated ambient minimal temperatures, which increased food availability and energy savings for the mice, and required diet change in the voles.

ID CONSEQUENCES; RANGES
AB Altitudinal shifts in distribution were investigated in forest breeding birds, along two elevational gradients in the French northern and southern Alps, from counts repeated at exactly the same locations in the 1970s and the 2000s. Significant shifts were reported for eight of 24 species in the northern alpine site (five downwards, three upwards) and for two of the 17 species in the southern site (one downwards, one upwards). Apart from the Crested Tit Parus cristatus, which shifted significantly downwards at both sites, altitudinal shifts were not significantly correlated between sites. Bird communities did not shift their distribution upwards despite a 2.3degreesC increase in spring temperatures in the two study areas. These results suggest that bird distributions by altitude have not yet been affected by climatic warming, and that most specific elevational shifts are probably related to site-specific factors.

AB The present study assessed variation in the abundances of large herbivorous invertebrates in south-western Australia. There was some habitat partitioning between different parts of the reef: of the most frequently recorded species, the sea urchins Phyllacanthus irregularis and Centrostephanus tenuispinus were found primarily at the base of steep rock faces, whereas the gastropods Turbo torquatus and Australium squamifera were found primarily on open sections of reef. The sea urchin Heliocidaris erythrogramma was evenly distributed between these two habitats. For C. tenuispinus and H. erythrogramma, differences among locations ( separated by tens to hundreds of kilometers) were the main source of variation in abundances. Phyllacanthus irregularis was more evenly distributed among locations. Abundances of sea urchins at each reef varied little over 26 months, suggesting low mortality and low recruitment. Turbo torquatus and A. squamifera varied significantly in abundance among reefs separated by < 10 km, although these differences were influenced by fluctuations over time. Broad patterns in abundances were evident: overall, abundances of herbivorous invertebrates were low, but certain areas supported high abundances. This suggests that herbivory may be a minor process in this region; however, the importance of herbivory at reefs with and without high abundances of herbivores deserves further attention.

AB The house finch (Carpodacus mexicanus) is a native songbird of western North America that was introduced to the eastern United States and Hawaiian Islands in historic times. As such, it provides an unusually good opportunity to test the ability of molecular markers to recover recent details of a known population history. To investigate this prospect, genetic variation in 172 individuals from 16 populations in the western and eastern United States, southeastern Canada, Hawaiian Islands, and Mexico, as well as genetic variation in the closely related purple finch (Carpodacus purpureus) and Cassin's finch (Carpodacus cassinii) was studied by a semi-automated fluorescence-labeled amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) marker system. A total of 363 markers were generated, of which 258 (71.2%) were polymorphic among species, 166 (61.4%) polymorphic among house finch subspecies, and 157 (60.2%) polymorphic among populations within the frontalis subspecies complex. Heterozygosities and interpopulation divergences revealed by the analysis appeared relatively low at all taxonomic levels, but there are few similar studies in avian populations with which to compare results. Whereas the known population history predicts that both eastern and Hawaiian finches should have been derived from within western populations, tree analysis using both populations and individuals as units suggest weak monophyly of eastern populations and indicates that Hawaiian populations are not clearly derived from California populations. However, the genetic distinctiveness of native and recently founded populations was disclosed by analyses of molecular variance as well as by a model-based assignment approach in which 98%, 94%, and 99% individuals from western, Hawaiian, and eastern regions, respectively, were assigned correctly to their populations without using prior information on population of origin, suggesting that these recent introductions have resulted in detectable differentiation without substantial loss of AFLP diversity. Our results indicate that AFLPs are a useful tool for population genetic and evolutionary studies of birds, particularly as a prelude to finding molecular markers linked to traits subjected to recent adaptive evolution.

AB Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is the most important cereal crop after rice in India. Optimum schedule of irrigation for wheat and its response to irrigation based on the ratio of irrigation water and cumulative pan evaporation (irrigation depth (IW):CPE at 1.2, 0.9 and 0.6) was studied in a field experiment during the winter seasons of 1989-1990 and 1990-1991. The site had a sandy loam (Typic Fluvaquent) soil and shallow water table, located in the humid tropical canal command area at the University Experimental Farm, Memari (23degrees1'N, 88degrees5'E and 21.34 m above mean sea level) in West Bengal, India. The yield of wheat, weekly and seasonal actual evapotranspiration (ETa) from water balance equation, crop coefficients (K-c), soil water stress coefficients (K-s), water extraction patterns, water use efficiency (WUE) and water application efficiency (A(e)) were determined. Maximum profile water depletion and ETa of wheat occurred in the wetter moisture regime (1.2 IW:CPE). The average daily ETa varied from <1 mm per day in the early growing period to a maximum value of 2.72 mm per day at 9-14 weeks after sowing (WAS) under 1.2 IW:CPE when leaf area index (LAI) was >3. During crop development to mid season (4-14 WAS), 1.2 IW:CPE showed 9-15% increased ETa than 0.9 and 0.6 IW:CPE. The seasonal ETa of wheat with IW:CPE of 1.2 was 238.2 and 261.95 mm during 1989-1990 and 1990-1991, respectively. Maximum roots were concentrated in the top 150 mm layer (57% of root length density) and maximum root water extraction efficiency (U-z) was observed at 600-750 mm depth under the drier soil moisture regimes of 0.9 and 0.6 IW:CPE, respectively. The yield increased significantly with increasing levels of irrigation. IW:CPE ratio of 1.2 produced 13 and 21% more yield, and 8 and 14% improved WUE than 0.9 and 0.6 IW:CPE, respectively. Water application efficiency (A(e)) was noticed higher (79.85%) under 0.6 IW:CPE irrigation regime. Precise information of K-c, which is required for regional scale irrigation planning is lacking in developing countries. The estimated values of K-c for wheat at four crop growth stages (initial, crop development, mid season and maturity) were 0.33, 0.82, 1.08 and 0.64, respectively which were identical to those suggested by the FAO indicating need for generating these values at the local/regional level. The K-s values of 0.6 IW:CPE decreased steeply and experienced more stress condition than 0.9 IW:CPE. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Trillium camschateense, a long-lived common woodland herb, has been experiencing intensive habitat fragmentation over the last century in eastern Hokkaido, Japan. We examined the genetic diversity and population genetic structure of 12 fragmented populations with different population sizes using allozyme electrophoresis. The percentage of polymorphic loci and mean number of alleles per locus were positively related to population size, probably due to the stochastic loss of rare alleles (frequency of q < 0.1) in small populations. Populations with 350 flowering plants or fewer had lost almost all of their rare alleles. While the heterozygosity and inbreeding coefficient were not related to population size, some small populations showed relatively high inbreeding coefficients. In spite of the low genetic differentiation among overall populations (F-ST = 0. 130), local population structuring was recognized between the two geographically discontinuous population groups.

AB Heterobaric leaves show heterogeneous pigmentation due to the occurrence of a network of transparent areas that are created from the bundle sheaths extensions (BSEs). Image analysis showed that the percentage of photosynthetically active leaf area (A(p)) of the heterobaric leaves of 31 plant species was species dependent, ranging from 91% in Malva sylvestris to only 48% in Gynerium sp. Although a significant portion of the leaf surface does not correspond to photosynthetic tissue, the photosynthetic capacity of these leaves, expressed per unit of projected area (P-max), was not considerably affected by the size of their transparent leaf area (A(t)). This means that the photosynthetic capacity expressed per A(p) (P-max*) should increase with A(t). Moreover, the expression of P-max* could be allowing the interpretation of the photosynthetic performance in relation to some critical anatomical traits. The P-max* irrespective of plant species, correlated with the specific leaf transparent volume (lambda(t)), as well as with the transparent leaf area complexity factor ((CF)A(t)), parameters indicating the volume per unit leaf area and length/density of the transparent tissues, respectively. Moreover, both parameters increased exponentially with leaf thickness, suggesting an essential functional role of BSEs mainly in thick leaves. The results of the present study suggest that although the A(p) of an heterobaric leaf is reduced, the photosynthetic performance of each areole is increased, possibly due to the light transferring capacity of BSEs, This mechanism may allow a significant increase in leaf thickness and a consequent increase of the photosynthetic capacity per unit (projected) area, offering adaptive advantages in xerothermic environments.

AB Climate variations over the Northern Hemisphere are to a substantial proportion associated with the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). Recently, many studies revealed the impacts of the NAO on the dynamics of organisms in different ecosystems but the results in the single studies were inconsistent. Here, we used meta-analysis techniques for a quantitative synthesis of results. We tested the influence of the NAO on the timing of life history events, on biomass of organisms, and on biomass of different trophic levels. We found a clear NAO signature in freshwater, marine, and terrestrial ecosystems. The response of life history events to the NAO was similar in all environments but less pronounced at higher latitudes. The magnitude of the biomass response was significantly related to the NAO, either positively in aquatic or negatively in terrestrial ecosystems. The response depended on longitude, the effect being less pronounced in Eastern Europe. The results stressed that a meta-analysis is a valuable tool in the field of climate-driven ecosystem responses and can identify more general ecological responses than single studies. We recommend the inclusion of nonsignificant results in order to archive an objective view of the strength of NAO and climate impacts in general.

AB An extensive survey of European wetlands was undertaken to compare the importance of growing conditions vs functional characteristics of vegetation in determining N, P and K contents.
   Stress-tolerator dominated stands (S) had consistently lower nutrient contents and higher N : P ratios whereas ruderal-dominated (R) stands displayed the opposite pattern. Competitor (C) and competitor-stress tolerator (CS) stands were intermediate to R and S.
   These patterns were mostly preserved after removing covariation between vegetation and environment, thus indicating constitutional differences in nutrient signatures between functionally differentiated vegetation. C and R stands were least likely to be nutrient limited. Half of the S stands were probably P-limited but C, CS and R stands rarely or never experienced P limitation. Inferred colimitation by K was twice as frequent in S stands compared with other vegetation.
   This study extends the evidence for syndromes of traits closely linked to nutrient use efficiency that increase fitness under particular growing conditions. It also highlights patterns at a community level across a wide range of wetland types and suggests that tissue nutrient signatures will have diagnostic value in predicting community responses to perturbation in nutrient availability.

AB The neutrality theory predicts that the rate of neutral molecular evolution is constant over time, and thus that there is a molecular clock for timing evolutionary events. It has been observed that the variance of the rate of evolution is generally larger than expected according to the neutrality theory, which has raised the question of how reliable the molecular clock is or, indeed, whether there is a molecular clock at all. We have carried out an extensive investigation of three proteins, glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and xanthine dehydrogenase (XDH). We have observed that (i) the three proteins evolve erratically through time and across lineages and (ii) the erratic patterns of acceleration and deceleration differ from locus to locus, so that one locus may evolve faster in one than another lineage, whereas the opposite may be the case for another locus. The observations are inconsistent with the predictions made by various subsidiary hypotheses proposed to account for the overdispersion of the molecular clock.

AB The effects of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) infection by Glomus mosseae (Nicolson & Gerdemann) Gerdemann & Trappe on growth, photosynthesis and nutrient concentration of cucumber (Cucumis sativus L. var. Telegraph Improved) were studied in sand culture with three different nutrient solutions based on the Long Ashton formula. These were high P+high concentrations of the other essential nutrients (full-strength solution containing 1.3 mM P), low P (0.13 mM) + high concentrations of the other nutrients and low P + low concentrations of the other nutrients (10% of the full-strength nutrient solution). AM infection was found to depend on both P supply and the availability of other nutrients. Plants grown at low P with high concentrations of other nutrients had the highest AM infection, and a higher biomass due to an enhanced maximum net photosynthetic rate (P,). Although this was unrelated to the N concentration of leaves, there was evidence that the higher P, was associated with a low leaf P concentration and the significance of these results is discussed. With high P and high concentrations of the other nutrients, a growth depression was found with +AM plants, although this was not due to a reduction in photosynthesis or an increase in leaf dark respiration rate. It was, however, associated with a reduction in photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency. Overall, the present study indicates that any advantages or disadvantages associated with AM infection in cucumber are a result of complex interactions between P supply and the availability of other essential nutrients.

AB Photosynthetic capacity and leaf properties of sun and shade leaves of overstorey sweetgum trees (Liquidambar styraciflua L.) were compared over the first 3 years of growth in ambient or ambient + 200 muL L-1 CO2 at the Duke Forest Free Air CO2 Enrichment (FACE) experiment, We were interested in whether photosynthetic downregulation to CO2 occurred in sweetgum frees growing in a forest ecosystem, whether shade leaves down-regulated to a greater extent than sun leaves, and if there was a seasonal component to photosynthetic down-regulation. During June and September of each year, we measured net photosynthesis (A) versus the calculated intercellular CO2 concentration (C-i) in situ and analysed these response curves using a biochemical model that described the limitations imposed by the amount and activity of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Vc(max)) and by the rate of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP) regeneration mediated by electron transport (J(max)). There was no evidence of photosynthetic down-regulation to CO2 in either sun or shade leaves of sweetgum trees over the 3 years of measurements. Elevated CO2 did not significantly affect Vc(max) or J(max). The ratio of Vc(max) to J(max) was relatively constant, averaging 2.12, and was not affected by CO2 treatment, position in the canopy, or measurement period. Furthermore, CO2 enrichment did not affect leaf nitrogen per unit leaf area (N-a), chlorophyll or total non-structural carbohydrates of sun or shade leaves. We did, however, find ka strong relationship between N-a and the modelled components of photosynthetic capacity, Vc(max) and J(max). Our data over the first 3 years of this experiment corroborate observations that frees rooted in the ground may not exhibit symptoms of photosynthetic down-regulation as quickly as free seedlings growing in pots. There was a strong sustained enhancement of photosynthesis by CO2 enrichment whereby light-saturated net photosynthesis of sun leaves was stimulated by 63% and light-saturated net photosynthesis of shade leaves was stimulated by 48% when averaged over the 3 years. This study suggests that this CO2 enhancement of photosynthesis will be sustained in the Duke Forest FACE experiment as long as soil N availability keeps pace with photosynthetic and growth processes.

AB Eleven populations of wapiti (Cervus elaphus) were analysed for genetic diversity using 12 microsatellite loci. Samples were taken from Vancouver Island, British Columbia; Burwash and French River herds in Ontario; Ya Ha Tinda Ranch, Alberta; and Banff, Elk Island, Jasper, Kootenay, Riding Mountain, Yellowstone and Yoho National Parks. Overall, wapiti populations have on average three to four alleles per locus and an average expected heterozygosity that ranged from 25.75 to 52.85%. The greatest genetic distances were observed between the Vancouver population and all other populations. Using the assignment test, Roosevelt wapiti (C. e. roosevelti Merriam 1897) assigned only to the Vancouver Island population. The distance and assignment values suggest a divergence of the Roosevelt wapiti from other populations and support the subspecific status for the Vancouver Island population. No evidence was found for the existence of unique Eastern wapiti (C. e. canadensis Erxleben 1777) in the Burwash or French River herds in Ontario. The overlapping distribution of genotypes from indigenous populations from Riding Mountain, Elk Island and Yellowstone National Parks suggests that wapiti were once a continuous population before settlers decimated their numbers. The lack of differentiation between these populations raises questions about the status of Manitoban (C. e.manitobensis Millais 1915) and Rocky Mountain (C. e.nelsoni Bailey 1935) subspecies.

AB The swordfish Xiphias gladius is a migratory oceanic species distributed in sub-tropical and temperate waters worldwide. Studies utilizing mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) have demonstrated genetic subdivision between ocean basins, as well as within the Atlantic basin. However, there has been no support of population subdivision within the Pacific. We sequenced 629 base pairs of the control region for 281 swordfish collected in the Pacific. A rate heterogeneity parameter, alpha, was found to be 0.201, indicating substantial variation in mutation rate within the control region of swordfish. Hierarchical analysis of molecular variance supported significant genetic structuring among Pacific populations. Northern and southern populations in the western Pacific were significantly divergent, while populations in the east appeared to be genetically continuous. Regression analysis supported a correlation of genetic differentiation with geographic distance along a U-shaped corridor of gene flow. These results reveal a pelagic biogeographic pattern heretofore unrecognized in the Pacific, and reject the null hypothesis that Pacific populations of swordfish are unstructured and comprise only a single homogeneous stock.

AB In the Australian myobatrachid frog Crinia georgiana simultaneous polyandry occurs in about half of all matings, which leads to multiple paternity, but reduced fertilization success and occasional female mortality. Multiple paternity may provide benefits to females that compensate for these costs, for example, through enhanced genetic diversity of a clutch. In nature, embryos and tadpoles of C. georgiana develop in shallow, temporary pools and may be exposed to fluctuating water levels and the risk of desiccation between rain events. Fertilization by genetically diverse sires may act as a bet hedge against these conditions. To evaluate this hypothesis, females were artificially mated with one or two males in the held and eggs and larvae reared in the laboratory under constant or fluctuating developmental conditions. Experiment 1 exposed embryos from single- and multiple-paternity clutches to conditions where eggs were completely covered during development or eggs sat in air on a moist substrate. Experiment 2 exposed freshly hatched larvae from single- and multiple-paternity clutches to constant wet conditions, where larvae were completely covered, or fluctuating wet conditions, where larvae ranged from being completely submersed to partially exposed over a 13- day cycle. We measured mean performance and best performance as alternate measures of genetic benefits. There were no effects of paternity on percent survival, to hatching, time to hatching, body size at hatching, percent survival to metamorphosis, time to metamorphosis, or body size at metamorphosis. We also analyzed variance within clutches as a measure of genetic diversity. Again there were no predictable effects of multiple paternity. Polyandry does not appear to provide any genetic benefits that compensate for the high costs of polyandry in this species.

AB Distribution of leaf nitrogen with respect to leaf mass per unit area (M-a), nitrogen per unit mass (N-m) and nitrogen per unit area (N-a) within peach (Prunus persica L.) tree canopies was studied in two field experiments. In one experiment, leaf light exposure and M-a were measured on leaves from different canopy positions of peach trees subjected to five nitrogen (N) fertilization treatments. Leaf light exposure and M-a were linearly related and the relationship was independent of N fertilization In a subsequent experiment, N fertilizer was applied to previously unfertilized trees in midsummer, after shoot growth had terminated. Application of N fertilizer did not affect mean canopy M-a. Fertilization increased N-m of all leaves throughout the canopy compared with non-fertilized trees. No significant relationship between N-m and M-a was found in either fertilized or control trees. There was a linear relationship between N-a and M-a and the slope of the relationship was increased by N fertilizer application. We conclude that distribution of N-a in peach tree canopies is primarily a function of M-a partitioning with light and N-m, which is related to soil N availability.

AB Due to their secretive habits, very little is known about the ecology of amphisbaenians. Based on a large series of specimens from the Cerrado of central Brazil, the diet composition, reproduction, and sexual dimorphism of Amphisbaena alba are described. Amphisbaena alba displayed a relatively diverse diet, even ingesting vertebrates and plant material. Beetles, ante, and spiders dominated the diet numerically, whereas ants, insect larvae, and beetles were more important volumetrically. No association was observed between prey size and body dimensions. The smallest reproductive male was 422 mm SVL (snout-vent length), and the smallest reproductive female was 457 nun SVL. Clutch size ranged from 8-16, one of the largest known for amphisbaenians, and is possibly influenced by the large body size of A. alba. Reproduction is apparently seasonal and restricted to the dry season. No intersexual differences were observed, either in morphometric or meristic characters, presumably because of functional constraints related to fossoriality.

AB Scaling leaf-level measurements to estimate carbon gain of entire leaf crowns or canopies requires an understanding of the distribution of photosynthetic capacity and corresponding light microenvironments within a crown. We have compared changes in the photosynthetic light response and nitrogen (N) content (Der unit leaf area) of Pinus contorta Dougl, ssp. latifolia Engelm. (lodgepole pine) leaves in relation to their age and light microenvironment. The vertical gradient in integrated daily photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) from the upper to the lower crown of lodgepole pine was similar in magnitude to the horizontal gradient in daily PPFD along shoots from young to old leaves. The relationship between light-saturated net photosynthesis (A(max)) and daily PPFD was significant for both young and old leaves. However, old leaves had a lower A(max) than young leaves in a similar daily irradiance regime. For leaves of all ages from throughout the crown, A(max) was linearly related to the estimated daily net carbon gain that leaves could achieve in their natural PPFD environment (estimated A(day)) (r(2) = 0.84, P < 0.001, n = 39), indicating that estimated A(day) may be dominated by carbon fixed when leaves are light-saturated and operating at A(max). Comparison of the PPFD required to achieve A(max) and the PPFD available to the leaves showed that all of the measured leaves (n = 39), regardless of their position in the crown or age, were in light environments that could light-saturate photosynthesis for a similar proportion of the day. For all data pooled, foliar N was weakly correlated with daily PPFD. Analyzing each leaf age class separately showed that foliar N was significantly related to daily PPFD, A(max), and estimated A(day) for the youngest leaves but not for middle-aged or old leaves. Therefore, the general theory that foliar N is allocated within a crown according to total daily light availability was supported only for young (1-4-year-old) leaves in this study.

AB We studied the effects of variation in shoot structure and needle morphology on the distributions of light and nitrogen within a Pacific silver fir (Abies amabilis (Dougl.) Forbes) canopy. Specifically, we investigated the role of morphological shade acclimation in the determination of resource use efficiency, which is claimed to be optimal when the distribution of nitrogen within the canopy is directly proportional to the distribution of intercepted photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). Shoots were collected from different heights in the crowns of trees representing four different size classes. A new method was developed to estimate seasonal light interceptance (SLI, intercepted PAR per unit needle area) of the shoots using a model for the directional distribution of above-canopy PAR, measurements of shoot silhouette area and canopy gap fraction in different directions. The ratio SLI/SLIo, where the reference value SLIo represents the seasonal light interceptance of a spherical surface at the shoot location, was used to quantify the efficiency of light capture by a shoot. The ratio SLI/SLIo, doubled from the top to the bottom of the canopy, mainly as a result of smaller internal shading in shade shoots than in sun shoots. Increased light-capturing efficiency of shade shoots implies that the difference in intercepted light by sun shoots versus shade shoots is much less than the decrease in available light from the upper to the lower canopy. For example, SLI of the five most sunlit shoots was only about 20 times greater than the SLI of the five most shaded shoots, whereas SLIo was 40 times greater for sun shoots than for shade shoots. Nitrogen content per unit needle area was about three times higher in sun needles than in shade needles. This variation, however, was not enough to produce proportionality between the amounts of nitrogen and intercepted PAR throughout the canopy.

AB Population dynamics of coral reef fishes and spiny lobster appear to be determined by variable recruitment interacting with post-settlement processes, particularly predation. The risk of predation may be modified by the scaling between prey and shelter size, which enhances the protective capacity of a reef. We experimentally tested these predictions by manipulating densities of predatory Nassau grouper Epinephelus striatus on 8 artificial patch reefs of 2 sizes (small, large) in a large seagrass bed near Lee Stocking Island, Bahamas. We initially censused patch reefs for 7 mo, after which we randomly selected equivalent numbers of small and large reefs to serve as permanent grouper removal versus control (non-removal) reefs. We continued to census patch reefs for 12 mo after predators were removed from certain reefs. The abundance of predatory Nassau grouper and the size of shelters from predation jointly explained the observed distribution and abundance patterns of spiny lobster and reef fish prey inhabiting artificial patch reef habitats. For example, the abundance of small lobsters was highest in small reefs where Nassau grouper were experimentally removed. When we assessed the effects of predator abundance on all reef fish prey (1 to 10 cm TL), we were unable to detect any significant effects on prey abundance or species diversity due to low statistical power. However, the total abundance and species richness of medium size reef fish (4 to 10 cm TL) was significantly higher in small shelters from which grouper were removed. In comparing species' relative abundances on reefs with low versus high numbers and Nassau grouper, the results indicated that grouper reduce prey abundances in a generalized, non-selective pattern, with no difference in the number of rare versus common prey species that were extirpated. Thus, juvenile Nassau grouper inhabiting certain patch reefs produce a general predatory impact, whereby predation reduces prey abundance and diversity in proportion to the initial relative abundance of prey. Our results support the prediction that at certain scales of space and time, post-settlement predation is a critical determinant of population abundance and species diversity of reef-fish and spiny lobster prey, and that the effect of predation is mediated by the protective capacity of a reef.

AB Fighting behavior between male copperheads (Agkistrodon contortrix) occurs during the two mating periods (late summer/fall and spring) to gain priority of access to females. Fights are characterized by prominent vertical challenge displays, swaying, and a high degree of physical contact that does not involve biting. At the moment of subordination, losers retreat quickly from fights and winners respond by chasing. Subsequently, losers do not participate in further challenge displays or fighting for at least 7 days, and also they show behavioral signs of stress, which includes submissive acts and suppression of sexual behavior. The goal of this study was to determine whether or not losers show elevated levels of plasma corticosterone (B) and depressed levels of plasma testosterone (T) relative to winners and controls. Winners and losers were produced in 13 staged trials. Two different controls (N = 26) were run. Males with no recent agonistic experience were (1) tested in the fighting arena in the absence of a competitive male but paired with a single female (N = 13), and (2) tested alone in their cages (N = 13). All trials, including controls, were conducted in spring and late summer. Mean B in losers at l-hr postfight was significantly greater than in winners and both control groups in both seasons. Mean T was significantly greater in late summer in all groups, as expected, but in each season was not significantly different between the groups. Levels of B and T were not correlated with SVL, mass, or duration of fighting. This study provides further support for the social insensitivity/challenge hypotheses and is the first to document postfight B and T levels in snakes. (C) 1996 Academic Press, Inc.

AB Mycorrhizal (Lactarius rufus Fr.) and non-mycorrhizal Norway spruce seedlings (Picea abies Karst.) were grown in a sand culture and inoculated with protozoa (naked amoebae and flagellates) extracted from native forest soil or with protozoa grown on agar cultures. A soil suspension from which the protozoa were eliminated by filtration or chloroform fumigation was used as a control. After 19 weeks of growth in a climate chamber at 20-22 degrees C, the seedlings were harvested. Protozoa reduced the number of bacterial colony-forming units extracted from the rhizoplane of both non-mycorrhizal and mycorrhizal seedlings and significantly increased seedling growth. However, concentrations of mineral nutrients in needles were not increased in seedlings with protozoan treatment. It is concluded that the increased growth of seedlings was not caused by nutrients released during amoebal grazing on rhizosphere micro-organisms. The protozoa presumably affected plant physiological processes, either directly, via production of phytohormones, or indirectly, via modification of the structure and performance of the rhizosphere microflora and their impact on plant growth. Mycorrhizal colonization significantly increased the abundance of naked amoebae at the rhizoplane. Our observations indicate that protozoa in the rhizosphere interact significantly with mycorrhizae.

AB The effects of microhabitat types on patterns of Cystoseira spp. settlement and recruitment in littoral rockpools were examined in this study. Three experiments were carried out from July 1989 to December 1991 on the west coast of Italy (Western Mediterranean). By manipulation of (1) the adult canopy of Cystoseira spp., (2) herbivore density and (3) substratum type, we tested the general null hypothesis that the distribution and abundance of Cystoseira spp. embryos and juveniles were unaffected by microhabitat differences. Settlement was higher in patches of algal turfs than in areas covered by encrusting corallines or dominated by a full canopy of Cystoseira spp. In contrast, recruitment was significantly higher in plots dominated by encrusting and filamentous algae when herbivores were removed. Grazers (essentially limpets), if left at their natural density, greatly reduced the abundance of both Cystoseira spp. embryos and juveniles in these areas. Our results indicated that post-settlement mortality could reverse the patterns of recruit abundance expected from the distribution of settlers among microhabitats. The information gathered in this study will allow more accurate predictions of the spatial and temporal variability of Cystoseira populations in littoral rockpools.

AB Understanding how plant species influence soil nutrient cycling is a major theme in terrestrial ecosystem ecology. However, the prevailing paradigm has mostly focused on litter decomposition, while rhizosphere effects on soil organic matter (SOM) decomposition have attracted little attention. Using a dual(13)C/N-15 labeling approach in a 'common garden' glasshouse experiment, we investigated how the economic strategies of 12 grassland plant species (graminoids, forbs and legumes) drive soil nitrogen (N) cycling via rhizosphere processes, and how this in turn affects plant N acquisition and growth. Acquisitive species with higher photosynthesis, carbon rhizodeposition and N uptake than conservative species induced a stronger acceleration of soil N cycling through rhizosphere priming of SOM decomposition. This allowed them to take up larger amounts of N and allocate it above ground to promote photosynthesis, thereby sustaining their faster growth. The N-2-fixation ability of legumes enhanced rhizosphere priming by promoting photosynthesis and rhizodeposition. Our study demonstrates that the economic strategies of plant species regulate a plant-soil carbon-nitrogen feedback operating through the rhizosphere. These findings provide novel mechanistic insights into how plant species with contrasting economic strategies sustain their nutrition and growth through regulating the cycling of nutrients by soil microbes in their rhizosphere.

AB Our ability to predict invasions has been hindered by the seemingly idiosyncratic context-dependency of individual invasions. However, we argue that robust and useful generalisations in invasion science can be made by considering "invasion syndromes" which we define as "a combination of pathways, alien species traits, and characteristics of the recipient ecosystem which collectively result in predictable dynamics and impacts, and that can be managed effectively using specific policy and management actions". We describe this approach and outline examples that highlight its utility, including: cacti with clonal fragmentation in arid ecosystems; small aquatic organisms introduced through ballast water in harbours; large ranid frogs with frequent secondary transfers; piscivorous freshwater fishes in connected aquatic ecosystems; plant invasions in high-elevation areas; tall-statured grasses; and tree-feeding insects in forests with suitable hosts. We propose a systematic method for identifying and delimiting invasion syndromes. We argue that invasion syndromes can account for the context-dependency of biological invasions while incorporating insights from comparative studies. Adopting this approach will help to structure thinking, identify transferrable risk assessment and management lessons, and highlight similarities among events that were previously considered disparate invasion phenomena.

AB As a result of the unique geographical characteristics, pastoral lifestyle, and economic conditions in Mongolia, its fragile natural ecosystems are highly sensitive to climate change and human activities. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was employed in this study as an indicator of the growth status of vegetation. The Sen's slope, Mann-Kendall test, and geographical detector modelling methods were used to assess the spatial and temporal changes of the NDVI in response to variations in natural conditions and human activities in Mongolia from 1982 to 2015. The corresponding individual and interactive driving forces, and the optimal range for the maximum NDVI value of vegetation distribution were also quantified. The area in which vegetation was degraded was roughly equal to the area of increase, but different vegetation types behaved differently. The desert steppe and the Gobi Desert both in arid regions have degraded significantly, whereas the meadow steppe and alpine steppe showed a significant upward trend. Precipitation can satisfactorily account for vegetation distribution. Changes of livestock quantity was the dominant factor influencing the changes of most vegetation types. The interactions of topographic factors and climate factors have significant effects on vegetation growth. In the region of annual precipitation between 331 mm and 596 mm, forest vegetation type and pine sandy soil type were found to be most suitable for the growth of vegetation in Mongolia. The findings of this study can help us to understand the appropriate range or type of environmental factors affecting vegetation growth in Mongolia, based on which we can apply appropriate interventions to effectively mitigate the impact of environmental changes on vegetation.

AB Hybridization among naturally separate taxa is increasing owing to human impact, and can result in taxon loss. Previous classification of anthropogenic hybridization has largely ignored the case of bimodal hybrid zones, in which hybrids commonly mate with parental species, resulting in many backcrossed individuals with a small proportion of introgressed genome. Genetic markers can be used to detect such hybrids, but until recently too few markers have been used to detect the true extent of introgression. Recent studies of wolves and trout have employed thousands of markers to reveal previously undetectable backcrosses. This improved resolution will lead to increased detection of late-generation backcrosses, shed light on the consequences of anthropogenic hybridization, and pose new management issues for conservation scientists.

AB Quantifying the spatial pattern and change of urban greenspace is a prerequisite to understanding the myriad ecosystem services provided by urban greenspace. Previous studies have largely focused on loss of greenspace due to urban expansion, using medium resolution imagery. This paper presents a comparison study on the spatiotemporal patterns of urban greenspace in nine major cities in China, using 2.5 m resolution ALOS and SPOT image data collected in 2005 and 2010, respectively. The changes in urban greenspace were further compared with those based on the commonly used 30 m Landsat TM data. The results show: 1) Urban greenspace was highly fragmented and heterogeneous, characterized by a mix of a large number of small-sized patches (smaller than 0.1 ha) with relatively few dispersed large patches in nine cities. 2) In contrast to findings from previous research that greenspace in inner cities tends to remain largely unchanged, urban greenspace in all nine cities was highly dynamic, experiencing both gain and loss, with net change ranging from 0.51% to 11.26% over five years. Most of the changes in urban greenspace, however, tended to occur as small patches, and could only be revealed by high spatial resolution imagery. 3) Spatial patterns of greenspace varied greatly across cities in terms of patch size, patch and edge density, and shape. Urban greenspace became increasingly fragmented and complex in the southern cities, but the opposite in the northern cities. The high turnover dynamics of urban greenspace in cities proper provide opportunities for better design and planning to achieve urban sustainability, but also call for better protection of small-sized urban greenspaces in Chinese cities.

AB Despite the urgent demand for sustainable mining, the revegetation and rehabilitation of areas degraded by mining activities remain challenging. Uncertainties about species selection, the management and control of alien invasive species and monitoring procedures require ongoing multidisciplinary research. Modern functional and phylogenetic approaches in community ecology represent powerful tools to enhance the entire rehabilitation process and to overcome these challenges, but methodologies that incorporate up-to-date phylogenetic information or knowledge about intraspecific variation along rehabilitation trajectories must be developed. Functional and phylogenetic criteria may play an especially important role in guiding the definition of faster-growing, more resistant species mixtures that can be applied in mine land revegetation and rehabilitation. Limiting similarity approaches may help to reduce biological invasions, enabling native vegetation to outcompete alien invasive species and aiding in the development of enduring mechanisms for controlling such species in rehabilitated mine land. Finally, incorporating phylogenetic and functional aspects into monitoring of the success of mine land rehabilitation with additional tools, such as remote sensing or metabarcoding, can enrich scientific knowledge about ecosystem functions such as nutrient cycling, community assembly and resource availability while providing sound information about the success of revegetation activities. In the middle to long term, research activities on these topics can provide valuable technical recommendations for all aspects of the management of rehabilitated ecosystems, thus contributing to more sustainable mining.

AB The maximum photosynthetic carboxylation rate (V-cmax) is an influential plant trait that has multiple scaling hypotheses, which is a source of uncertainty in predictive understanding of global gross primary production (GPP).
   Four trait-scaling hypotheses (plant functional type, nutrient limitation, environmental filtering, and plant plasticity) with nine specific implementations were used to predict global V-cmax distributions and their impact on global GPP in the Sheffield Dynamic Global Vegetation Model (SDGVM).
   Global GPP varied from 108.1 to 128.2 PgC yr(-1), 65% of the range of a recent model inter-comparison of global GPP. The variation in GPP propagated through to a 27% coefficient of variation in net biome productivity (NBP). All hypotheses produced global GPP that was highly correlated (r = 0.85-0.91) with three proxies of global GPP.
   Plant functional type-based nutrient limitation, underpinned by a core SDGVM hypothesis that plant nitrogen (N) status is inversely related to increasing costs of N acquisition with increasing soil carbon, adequately reproduced global GPP distributions. Further improvement could be achieved with accurate representation of water sensitivity and agriculture in SDGVM. Mismatch between environmental filtering (the most data-driven hypothesis) and GPP suggested that greater effort is needed understand V-cmax variation in the field, particularly in northern latitudes.

AB We examined whether variations in photosynthetic capacity are linked to variations in the environment and/or associated leaf traits for tropical moist forests (TMFs) in the Andes/western Amazon regions of Peru.
   We compared photosynthetic capacity (maximal rate of carboxylation of Rubisco (V-cmax), and the maximum rate of electron transport (J(max))), leaf mass, nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) per unit leaf area (M-a, N-a and P-a, respectively), and chlorophyll from 210 species at 18 field sites along a 3300-m elevation gradient. Western blots were used to quantify the abundance of the CO2-fixing enzyme Rubisco.
   Area- and N-based rates of photosynthetic capacity at 25 degrees C were higher in upland than lowland TMFs, underpinned by greater investment of N in photosynthesis in high-elevation trees. Soil [P] and leaf Pa were key explanatory factors for models of area-based Vcmax and Jmax but did not account for variations in photosynthetic N-use efficiency. At any given N-a and P-a, the fraction of N allocated to photosynthesis was higher in upland than lowland species. For a small subset of lowland TMF trees examined, a substantial fraction of Rubisco was inactive.
   These results highlight the importance of soil- and leaf-P in defining the photosynthetic capacity of TMFs, with variations in N allocation and Rubisco activation state further influencing photosynthetic rates and N-use efficiency of these critically important forests.

AB Plants cope with the environment in a variety of ways, and ecological analyses attempt to capture this through life-history strategies or trait-based categorization. These approaches are limited because they treat the trade-off mechanisms that underlie plant responses as a black box. Approaches that involve the molecular or physiological analysis of plant responses to the environment have elucidated intricate connections between developmental and environmental signals, but in only a few well-studied model species. By considering diversity in the plant response to the environment as the adaptation of an information-processing network, new directions can be found for the study of life-history strategies, trade-offs and evolution in plants.

AB The paper studies the horizontal global, direct-beam and sky-diffuse solar irradiance data measured in Hong Kong from 2008 to 2013. A machine learning algorithm was employed to predict the horizontal sky-diffuse irradiance and conduct sensitivity analysis for the meteorological variables. Apart from the clearness index (horizontal global/extra atmospheric solar irradiance), we found that predictors including solar altitude, air temperature, cloud cover and visibility are also important in predicting the diffuse component. The mean absolute error (MAE) of the logistic regression using the aforementioned predictors was less than 21.5 W/m(2) and 30 W/m(2) for Hong Kong and Denver, USA, respectively. With the systematic recording of the five variables for more than 35 years, the proposed model would be appropriate to estimate of long-term diffuse solar radiation, study climate change and develope typical meteorological year in Hong Kong and places with similar climates.

AB Research in plant hydraulics has provided important insights into plant responses to drought and species absolute drought tolerance. However, our ability to predict when plants will die from hydraulic failure under extreme drought is limited by a lack of knowledge with regards to the dynamics of plant desiccation following stomatal closure. Thus, we develop a simple hydraulics model based on branch-level traits that incorporates key aspects of allometry, rates of water loss and resistance to embolism thresholds in order to define species differences in the time it takes plants to desiccate from stomatal closure to lethal levels of drought stress.

AB Many species have isolated, inbred populations that have a high risk of extinction from inbreeding depression. While inbreeding can be reversed by outcrossing (genetic rescue), doubts have been expressed about whether fitness benefits persist beyond the F1 generation. To address this issue, I used a meta-analysis to evaluate the effects of outcrossing of inbred populations on reproductive fitness in F1, F2 and F3 (and later) generations for population crosses screened as having a low risk of outbreeding depression. Outcrossing of inbred populations was significantly beneficial compared to the inbred parent in the F1, F2 and F3 (and later) generations, with 90.5%, 100% and 94.1% of comparisons beneficial, respectively. The median benefits of outcrossing on composite fitness (combined fecundity and survival) were 42%, 84% and 86% in the F1, F2 and F3 generations, respectively, and F2 and F3 effects were not significantly different from those in the F1. Further, pre-screening to detect possible outbreeding depression was highly effective. Consequently, outcrossing can be recommended to genetically rescue inbred populations, provided the risk of outbreeding depression has been assessed and found to be low. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB We present a fast and flexible software package-SimPhy-for the simulation of multiple gene families evolving under incomplete lineage sorting, gene duplication and loss, horizontal gene transfer-all three potentially leading to species tree/gene tree discordance-and gene conversion. SimPhy implements a hierarchical phylogenetic model in which the evolution of species, locus, and gene trees is governed by global and local parameters (e.g., genome-wide, species-specific, locus-specific), that can be fixed or be sampled from a priori statistical distributions. SimPhy also incorporates comprehensive models of substitution rate variation among lineages (uncorrelated relaxed clocks) and the capability of simulating partitioned nucleotide, codon, and protein multilocus sequence alignments under a plethora of substitution models using the program INDELible. We validate SimPhy's output using theoretical expectations and other programs, and show that it scales extremely well with complex models and/or large trees, being an order of magnitude faster than the most similar program (DLCoal-Sim). In addition, we demonstrate how SimPhy can be useful to understand interactions among different evolutionary processes, conducting a simulation study to characterize the systematic overestimation of the duplication time when using standard reconciliation methods. SimPhy is available at https://github.com/adamallo/SimPhy, where users can find the source code, precompiled executables, a detailed manual and example cases.

AB Behavioral responses of fishes to variability in environmental conditions and habitat quality are central to population-level demographic processes. Although field surveys can correlate abundance to habitat variables (physiochemical, biotic, and structural), they cannot provide mechanistic explanations. Moreover, field surveys are often stratified by time or geographic criteria relevant to humans, whereas fishes stratify by habitat variables relevant to them. If mechanisms underlying behavior are not explicitly understood, conclusions based on survey data can lead to biased inferences as to species-specific habitat requirements and preferences, as well as changes in stock size occurring over time. Because physiology is the transfer function that links specific environmental conditions to behavior and fitness, we argue great gains can be made through the integration of physiology and fisheries science. These are complementary disciplines, albeit ones that generally function at very different temporal and spatial scales, as well as different levels of biological organization. We argue more specifically that integrating physiological approaches with behavioral studies and traditional fisheries survey data (where each approach develops hypotheses to be tested in the other) can mechanistically link processes from cells through populations to place fisheries management in an appropriate ecosystem context. We further contend that population- and species-specific mechanistic understanding of physiological abilities and tolerances can significantly help to: improve stock assessments, describe essential fish habitat, predict rates of post-release mortality, develop effective bycatch reduction strategies, and forecast the population effects of increases in global temperatures and ocean acidification.

AB Boreal regions store most of the global terrestrial carbon, which can be transferred as dissolved organic carbon (DOC) to inland waters with implications for both aquatic ecology and carbon budgets. Headwater riparian zones (RZ) are important sources of DOC, and often just a narrow dominant source layer' (DSL) within the riparian profile is responsible for most of the DOC export. Two important questions arise: how long boreal RZ could sustain lateral DOC fluxes as the sole source of exported carbon and how its hydromorphological variability influences this role. We estimate theoretical turnover times by comparing carbon pools and lateral exports in the DSL of 13 riparian profiles distributed over a 69km(2) catchment in northern Sweden. The thickness of the DSL was 36 +/- 18 (average +/- SD) cm. Thus, only about one-third of the 1-m-deep riparian profile contributed 90% of the lateral DOC flux. The 13 RZ exported 8.7 +/- 6.5g C m(-2)year(-1), covering the whole range of boreal stream DOC exports. The variation could be explained by local hydromorphological characteristics including RZ width (R-2=0.90). The estimated theoretical turnover times were hundreds to a few thousands of years, that is there is a potential long-lasting supply of DOC. Estimates of net ecosystem production in the RZ suggest that lateral fluxes, including both organic and inorganic C, could be maintained without drawing down the riparian pools. This was supported by measurements of stream (DOC)-C-14 that indicated modern carbon as the predominant fraction exported, including streams disturbed by ditching. The transfer of DOC into boreal inland waters from new and old carbon sources has a major influence on surface water quality and global carbon balances. This study highlights the importance of local variations in RZ hydromorphology and DSL extent for future DOC fluxes under a changing climate.

AB Rapidly growing trade of ornamental animals may represent an entry pathway for emerging pathogens; this may concern freshwater crayfish that are increasingly popular pets. Infected crayfish and contaminated water from aquaria may be released to open waters, thus endangering native crustacean fauna. We tested whether various non-European crayfish species available in the pet trade in Germany and the Czech Republic are carriers of two significant crustacean pathogens, the crayfish plague agent Aphanomyces astaci and the white spot syndrome virus (WSSV). The former infects primarily freshwater crayfish (causing substantial losses in native European species), the latter is particularly known for economic losses in shrimp aquacultures. We screened 242 individuals of 19 North American and Australasian crayfish taxa (the identity of which was validated by DNA barcoding) for these pathogens, using molecular methods recommended by the World Organisation for Animal Health. A. astaci DNA was detected in eight American and one Australian crayfish species, comprising in total 27 % of screened batches. Furthermore, viability of A. astaci was confirmed by its isolation to axenic cultures from three host taxa, including the parthenogenetic invader Marmorkrebs (Procambarus fallax f. virginalis). In contrast, WSSV was only confirmed in three individuals of Australian Cherax quadricarinatus. Despite modest prevalence of detected infections, our results demonstrate the potential of disease entry and spread through this pathway, and should be considered if any trade regulations are imposed. Our study highlights the need for screening for pathogens in the ornamental trade as one of the steps to prevent the transmission of emerging diseases to wildlife.

AB Despite its importance for the long-term viability of populations and functioning of ecosystems, the genetic diversity of populations is seldom given explicit consideration in conservation prioritization. Research on the species-genetic diversity correlation (SGDC) suggests that species diversity within a community and intrapopulation genetic diversity are positively correlated, due to the parallel influences of environmental characteristics (area, connectivity, and environmental heterogeneity) on both levels of diversity. A positive locality scale SGDC (i.e. alpha-SGDC) thus provides potential for simultaneous conservation of both species diversity within a locality and intrapopulation genetic diversity. However, caution is needed, since in some situations environmental characteristics can influence species diversity and genetic diversity differently, resulting in a negative alpha-SGDC. In such cases there can be a conflict between conservation of species diversity within localities and genetic diversity within populations. SGDCs provide useful information also for conservation planning, which considers compositional differences between localities, since the mechanisms behind alpha-SGDCs can also drive correlations between differentiation of community and genetic compositions (i.e. beta-SGDCs). We suggest that emphasizing locality area and connectivity between similar localities in conservation planning best conserves both species and intrapopulation genetic diversity, and that focusing on highly complementary species richness may compromise conservation of genetic diversity.

AB A scarcity of life-history data currently exists for many exploited coral reef fishes, hindering our ability to interpret fishery dynamics and develop sound conservation policies. In particular, parrotfishes (Family Labridae) represent a ubiquitous and ecologically important group that is increasingly prevalent in commercial and artisanal fisheries worldwide. We used both fishery-dependent and fishery-independent data to examine the effect of life histories on vulnerability to overexploitation in parrotfishes. Vulnerability for each species was derived from independent measures associated with both temporal (20-year catch records) and spatial datasets. Most life-history traits examined were significant predictors of vulnerability across species, but their relative utility differed considerably. Length-based traits (e.g., lengths at maturity and sex change, maximum length) were generally superior to age-based traits (e.g., life span), but one age-based trait, age at female maturation, was the best predictor. The results suggest that easily derived metrics such as maximum length can be effective measures of sensitivity to exploitation when applied to phylogenetically related multispecies assemblages, but more holistic and comprehensive age-based demographic data should be sought, especially in data-deficient and heavily impacted regions. Given the increasing prevalence of parrotfishes in the global coral reef harvest, species-specific responses demonstrate the capacity for heavy fishing pressure to alter parrotfish assemblages considerably.

AB Several studies have demonstrated that topography, as a proxy for resource availability, plays an important role in shaping tree species distribution patterns in tropical forests. Here we take a functional approach by assessing changes in plant functional traits along topographical gradients in a 20-ha forest dynamics plot in Xishuangbanna, southern Yunnan, China. We hypothesized that observed changes in trait composition and diversity along the topographic gradient should reflect tree life-history strategies linked to resource (water and nutrients) availability. We measured and compiled data of the maximum height, leaf area, seed mass and wood density of 334 tree species in 500 subplots (20 x 20 m). We found that species composition and diversity changed significantly along the topographical gradient. This change was accompanied by increasing community average seed mass and wood density, and decreasing leaf area and tree maximum height with higher elevations and steeper slopes. Higher slopes and ridges were being dominated by tree communities that, possibly due to environmental filtering, converged on a combination of traits characteristic of slow growth and low turn-over. Lower slopes and valleys, on the other hand, were dominated by tree communities that showed high trait evenness and divergence, and tree species characterized by traits indicative of fast growth and turn-over, i.e. competition for resources may be responsible for complementary trait combinations and resource use in this habitat type. Our study shows that functional traits can provide a mechanistic understanding of the processes shaping tropical tree community assembly along topographical gradients and supplements information obtained using species composition and diversity data. Some practical outcomes of our study include: (1) plant species compositional trends in tropical forests can be predicted with GIS technology, focusing on topographical gradients; (2) forest communities on ridges may become more dominant and expand in the future due to increasing drought severity; (3) a considerable number of tropical tree species may currently be under threat of local extinction due to topographically biased deforestation trends and (4) trait based survey approaches improve our understanding of the mechanisms behind species compositional trends.

AB Freshwater rivers have been substantially altered by development and flow regulation. Altered hydrological regimes have affected a range of biota, but impacts are often most obvious on freshwater fish. Flow largely influences the range of physical habitat available to fish at various life history stages. Biological rhythms are therefore often linked to flow and optimized so that opportunities for spawning, growth and dispersal are synchronized. Assuming that flow therefore becomes the main factor which structures freshwater fish communities, the use of species specific biological information should be able to inform adaptive flow delivery strategies from the river reach to catchment scale. A test of this assertion was performed as a case study of native fish within the Edward-Wakool River system (New South Wales, Australia). Fish within the system were assigned to one of four groups based on biological similarity. Aspects of reproductive and movement ecology were then reviewed to generate optimal flow release strategies for each group. Life expectancy and hydrological constraints were then investigated and used to develop a possible 10-year flow delivery program that could generate ecological outcomes within a strategic adaptive management framework that considered potential impacts on third parties. The approach could be used to develop flow characteristics to benefit biota in any watercourse provided enough data are available to link potential outcomes with flow delivery.

AB Restoration of riparian vegetation is widely recognized as a tool in stream rehabilitation, but information on whether local riparian characteristics can mitigate the effects of catchment-level stressors on in-stream processes is limited. We measured community metabolism in 21 streams in the Canterbury region of New Zealand along 2 independent gradients of agricultural intensity and riparian cover (from closed canopied to open canopied) to assess relative effects of landscape and local factors on stream trophic state. We measured stream metabolism with the single-station open-channel diel O-2 method. We found a correlation between gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER), indicating a gradient of trophic states across sites. Streams were strongly heterotrophic with P: R values varying from 0.01 to 0.25. GPP and ER increased with % agriculture and % macrophyte cover, but decreased with % shade from riparian vegetation. Hierarchical partitioning analysis indicated that % agriculture was the only landuse variable to have a significant independent effect on GPP and ER. Among local variables, % shade and % macrophyte cover had significant independent effects on GPP. Percent shade was the only local variable to have a significant independent effect on ER. Percent shade had a stronger effect on both GPP and ER than did % agriculture, and a trade-off exists between the importance of agricultural and forest cover on stream metabolism at different spatial scales. Our results highlight the role of local riparian conditions in controlling trophic state and the importance of riparian buffers as a tool to mitigate eutrophication in streams and rivers.

AB Biogeographic transition zones in marine temperate systems are often hotspots of biodiversity, with high levels of resilience to short-term climate shifts due to naturally occurring cyclic oscillations of oceanographic conditions. However, these environments are likely vulnerable to a steady global warming scenario in which these cyclical conditions could be disrupted. Here, we evaluate how changes in local oceanography affect the structure of rocky reef fish assemblages over a period of 50 yr in a biogeographic transition zone. Using a 12 yr time series of rocky reef fish assemblage structure, we identified the set of oceanographic variables that most influenced assemblage dynamics. Descriptive and predictive models (multivariate regression trees) were compared to observed data using the area under the curve. Winter northward wind stress and sea surface temperature (SST) were the most important drivers of change in assemblage structure. Only warmer years had indicator species with warm-temperate or tropical affinities. A fish assemblage 'tropicalization' index was developed in response to both local-spatial resolution and short-term environmental variation (1993-2011), and to regional spatial resolution and long-term SST (1960-2012). Predictive modelling for the last 50 yr revealed that species with tropical affinities have increased in frequency compared to cold-temperate species, coinciding with the trend of increasing mean winter SST. Since the mid-1980s, warm-temperate and tropical species have responded rapidly to more frequent warm winters, suggesting that species distributions are shifting polewards. Our results support a hypothesis that cold species retreat more slowly than the advance of warm species. We discuss the importance of transition zones as ` barometers' of climate change.

AB According to island biogeography theory, the species richness of patches is determined by their size and spatial isolation, while in conservation practice, it is patch quality that determines protection and guides management. We analysed whether size, isolation or habitat quality are most important for the species richness in a set of 50 dry grassland fragments in agricultural landscapes of eastern Austria. We studied two plant taxa (vascular plants, bryophytes) and 11 invertebrate taxa (gastropods, spiders, springtails, grasshoppers, true bugs, leafhoppers and planthoppers, ground beetles, rove beetles, butterflies and burnets, ants and wild bees). The species richness of three categories was analysed: (1) dry grassland specialist species, (2) all grassland species and (3) all species. We used regression and hierarchical partitioning techniques to determine the relationship between species richness and environmental variables describing patch size and shape, patch quality, landscape configuration and landscape quality. The area-isolation paradigm was only applicable for dry grassland specialists, which comprised 12% of all species. Richness of all grassland species was determined mostly by landscape heterogeneity parameters. Total species richness was highly influenced by spillover from adjacent biotopes, and was significantly determined by the percentage of arable land bordering the patches. When analysing all taxa together, species richness of dry grassland specialists was significantly related to historical patch size but not to current patch size, indicating an extinction debt. At the landscape scale, the variable 'short-grass area' was a better predictor than the less specific variable 'area of extensively used landscape elements'. 'Distance to mainland' was a good predictor for specialists of mobile animal taxa. Plant specialists showed a pronounced dependence on quality measures at the patch scale and at the landscape scale, whereas animal specialists were influenced by patch size, patch quality, landscape quality and isolation measures. None of the taxa benefited from linear structures in the surroundings. In conclusion, high patch quality and a network of high-quality areas in the surrounding landscape should be the best conservation strategy to ensure conservation of dry grassland specialists. This goal does not conflict with the specific demands of single taxa. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB During population establishment, genetic drift can be the key driver of changes in genetic diversity, particularly while the population is small. However, natural selection can also play a role in shaping diversity at functionally important loci. We used a well-studied, re-introduced population of the threatened Stewart Island robin (N=722 pedigreed individuals) to determine whether selection shaped genetic diversity at innate immunity toll-like receptor (TLR) genes, over a 9-year period of population growth following establishment with 12 genetic founders. We found no evidence for selection operating with respect to TLR diversity on first-year overwinter survival for the majority of loci, genotypes and alleles studied. However, survival of individuals with TLR4(BE) genotype was significantly improved: these birds were less than half as likely to die prior to maturity compared with all other TLR4 genotypes. Furthermore, the population frequency of this genotype, at a two-fold excess over Hardy-Weinberg expectation, was increased by nonrandom mating. Near-complete sampling and full pedigree and reproductive data enabled us to eliminate other potential causes of these patterns including inbreeding, year effects, density dependence, selection on animals at earlier life history stages or genome-level association of the TLR4(E) allele with good genes'. However, comparison of observed levels of gene diversity to predictions under simulated genetic drift revealed results consistent with neutral expectations for all loci, including TLR4. Although selection favoured TLR4(BE) heterozygotes in this population, these effects were insufficient to outweigh genetic drift. This is the first empirical study to show that genetic drift can overwhelm natural selection in a wild population immediately following establishment.

AB Aim We combined genetic sequence data and ecological niche modelling to resolve the impacts of past climatic fluctuations on the distribution, genetic diversification, and demographic dynamics of an East Asian montane bird, the green-backed tit (Parus monticolus). Location East Asia. Methods Phylogenetic analyses were carried out using four mitochondrial fragments and seven nuclear loci from 161 birds sampled from 29 localities spanning the entire geographical range of the green-backed tit. We used *beast to estimate the species tree and calculate divergence times. Extended Bayesian skyline plots were used to infer potential historical shifts in population size. We used MaxEnt to predict potential distributions during three periods: the present day, the Last Glacial Maximum and the Last Interglacial. Results The mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) gene tree showed strong support for three reciprocally monophyletic groups: a south-western clade, a central clade and a Taiwanese clade. Taiwanese and Vietnamese samples had fixed differences at several nuclear loci, but the south-western and central samples shared haplotypes at all nuclear loci. The mtDNA gene tree topology differed from the species tree topology. The species tree suggested sister relationships between Taiwanese and Vietnamese operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and between south-western and central OTUs. Diversification within the green-backed tit was relatively recent, probably within the last 0.9 million years. Extended Bayesian skyline plots suggested rapid population expansion in the south-western and central phylogroups after the Last Interglacial, and this result was consistent with ecological niche models. Main conclusions Our results suggest that genetic diversification within the green-backed tit was affected by the later Pleistocene climate fluctuations. Ecological niche models indicated that the present-day vegetation distribution was, in many ways, more similar to that of the Last Glacial Maximum than it was to that of the Last Interglacial. Continental populations of the green-backed tit experienced unusual demographic and range expansion that is likely to have occurred during the cooling transition between the Last Interglacial and the Last Glacial Maximum. We found incongruence between the mtDNA gene tree and the species tree, which underscores the importance of using both mitochondrial and nuclear markers when estimating the evolutionary history of populations.

AB The influence of soil physicochemical properties on microbial communities can be large, especially in developing soils of glacier forefield chronosequences. However, small-scale expositional differences in bare soils and their impacts on soil microbial communities have so far been largely neglected. Here we studied the changes of microbial communities in three deglaciated unvegetated sites along a soil moisture and temperature gradient near a glacier terminus. In order to elucidate the driving forces for these changes, fine granite sediment was reciprocally transferred and regularly sampled during 16 months to determine microbial activities and the bacterial and fungal community structures and compositions using T-RFLP profiling and sequence analysis. Microbial activities only responded to soil transfer from the warmer and drier site to the colder and moister site, whereas the bacterial and fungal community structures responded to transfer in both directions. Bacterial phylotypes found to react to soil transfer were mainly the Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, alpha- and beta-Proteobacteria. The common fungal phylogenetic groups Pezizomycetes and mitosporic Ascomycetes also reacted to soil transfer. It seemed that the soil moisture was the limiting factor for the microbial activities. We concluded that for the microbial community structures transferring soil from a colder to a warmer site induced a higher rate of change due to a higher microbial activity and faster species turnover than the reverse transfer.

   consequences for functional diversity

AB It is anticipated that anthropogenic climate change will lead to substantial reassembly within communities in coming decades as individual species shift their ranges to track optimal conditions for growth and survival. As species are lost and gained in communities, what are the consequences for functional trait diversity? Functional traits are the characteristics of species that affect individual performance and provide the vital link between biodiversity at the species level and ecosystem function. We investigated how projected changes in species richness in plant communities under climate change scenarios for the decade 2050 will affect the distribution and diversity of five functional traits. We aggregated range change projections made in Maxent for the decade 2050 across all species in the regional pool of littoral rainforest vines in eastern Australia (n = 163 species). The effect of richness changes on trait diversity was assessed in nine rainforest reserves along the east coast of Australia. Although richness was predicted to significantly decline across all communities, functional diversity remained stable, indicating a decoupling in response to climate change at these two different levels of biological organization. A high degree of redundancy in trait composition in communities may buffer against the loss of function in these plant communities. Scaling-up our understanding of the impact of climate change from the species level to communities is a critical step towards developing conservation strategies aimed at preserving ecosystem function.

AB Do small-scale experiments showing spatial density dependence in marine fishes scale-up to temporal density dependence and regulation of relatively large local populations? If so, what are the causative mechanisms and their implications? We conducted an eight-year multigeneration study of population dynamics of bicolor damselfish (Stegastes partitus) inhabiting four large coral reefs in the Bahamas. After a four-year baseline period, it was clear that two populations naturally received very few settlement-stage larvae, so recruitment of recently settled fish was artificially enhanced at one low-settlement reef and reduced at one high-settlement reef to ensure a broad range of population sizes over which to test for regulation. Over all eight years, populations on the two naturally high-settlement reefs experienced temporal density dependence in multiple per capita demographic rates: mortality, survival to adulthood, and fecundity. These local populations also displayed components of regulation: persistence, boundedness, and return tendency. Reefs supporting regulated populations were structurally complex, providing sufficient prey refuges that ensured high survival at low densities. In contrast, populations at low-settlement reefs experienced either density-independent or slightly inversely density-dependent demographic rates, even though recruitment was artificially augmented to high levels at one reef. There was no evidence of regulation at these reefs, and indeed, one local population suffered temporary extirpation. Here, habitat complexity was relatively low, increasing the risk of predation, especially at low population densities when fish would have to travel longer distances when finding mates or home sites inhabited by conspecifics. Among all demographic parameters, density dependence in individual growth (an indicator of within-species competition for food) was least correlated with the presence or absence of local population regulation. We conclude that, for systems like these, the environmental context of a local population, especially predation risk and the distribution and abundance of spatial refuges, is more important than the magnitude of larval supply alone in determining the existence of regulating density dependence. At the broader metapopulation scale, density dependence in both survival and fecundity exogenously caused by predation may provide regulation for the entire stock, even when endogenous within-species competition (assumed to be important in most fisheries models) is weak.

AB World fisheries, already vulnerable, are under increasing pressure from the impacts of climate change. Using the Tasmanian rock lobster industry as a case study, we considered the efficacy of risk perception as a tool to inform how to communicate the science of climate change and suggestions for management in relation to development of adaptation strategies for fisheries. Fishers surveyed in this study operate in a fishery that is expected to undergo large changes as a consequence of climate change. Fishers also reported observations of similar large changes in the marine environment and lobster fishery consistent with climate change: yet most fishers surveyed expressed doubts about whether climate change was a real process. The important point for adaption of the industry to climate change is that fisher perceptions of risk tended to create barriers to acceptance of climate change as an issue. This means that there is a barrier to communication and awareness about climate change and thus a barrier to future action on the issue. Improving acceptance of climate change and thus ability to adapt will require the development of communications that are culturally appropriate and palatable to fishers. We argue that the application of social learning principles in communications about climate change may be one constructive way forward. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Genetic diversity generally underpins population resilience and persistence. Reductions in population size and absence of gene flow can lead to reductions in genetic diversity, reproductive fitness, and a limited ability to adapt to environmental change increasing the risk of extinction. Island populations are typically small and isolated, and as a result, inbreeding and reduced genetic diversity elevate their extinction risk. Two island populations of the platypus, Ornithorhynchus anatinus, exist; a naturally occurring population on King Island in Bass Strait and a recently introduced population on Kangaroo Island off the coast of South Australia. Here we assessed the genetic diversity within these two island populations and contrasted these patterns with genetic diversity estimates in areas from which the populations are likely to have been founded. On Kangaroo Island, we also modeled live capture data to determine estimates of population size. Levels of genetic diversity in King Island platypuses are perilously low, with eight of 13 microsatellite loci fixed, likely reflecting their small population size and prolonged isolation. Estimates of heterozygosity detected by microsatellites (H-E = 0.032) are among the lowest level of genetic diversity recorded by this method in a naturally outbreeding vertebrate population. In contrast, estimates of genetic diversity on Kangaroo Island are somewhat higher. However, estimates of small population size and the limited founders combined with genetic isolation are likely to lead to further losses of genetic diversity through time for the Kangaroo Island platypus population. Implications for the future of these and similarly isolated or genetically depauperate populations are discussed.

AB Most capture-recapture studies are inherently spatial in nature, with capture probabilities depending on the location of traps relative to animals. The spatial component of the studies has until recently, however, not been incorporated in statistical capture-recapture models. This paper reviews capture-recapture models that do include an explicit spatial component. This is done in a non-technical way, omitting much of the algebraic detail and focussing on the model formulation rather than on the estimation methods (which include inverse prediction, maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods). One can view spatially explicit capture-recapture (SECR) models as an endpoint of a series of spatial sampling models, starting with circular plot survey models and moving through conventional distance sampling models, with and without measurement errors, through mark-recapture distance sampling (MRDS) models. This paper attempts a synthesis of these models in what I hope is a style accessible to non-specialists, placing SECR models in the context of other spatial sampling models.

AB In the spirit of recent calls for species delimitation studies to become more pluralistic, incorporating multiple sources of evidence, we adopted an integrative, phylogeographic approach to delimiting species and evolutionarily significant units (ESUs) in the Corallorhiza striata species complex. This rare, North American, mycoheterotrophic orchid has been a taxonomic challenge regarding species boundaries, displaying complex patterns of variation and reduced vegetative morphology. We employed plastid DNA, nuclear DNA and morphometrics, treating the C. striata complex as a case study for integrative species delimitation. We found evidence for the differentiation of the endangered C. bentleyi (eastern USA) + C. striata var. involuta (Mexico) from the remaining C. striata (= C. striata s.s.; USA, Canada, Mexico). Corallorhiza striata involuta and C. bentleyi, disjunct by thousands of kilometres (Mexico-Appalachia), were genetically identical but morphologically distinct. Evidence suggests the C. striata complex represents three species: C. bentleyi, C. involuta and a widespread C. striata s.s under operational criteria of diagnosability and common allele pools. In contrast, Bayesian coalescent estimation delimited four species, but more informative loci and a resultant species tree will be needed to place higher confidence in future analyses. Three distinct groupings were identified within C. striata s.s., corresponding to C. striata striata, C. striata vreelandii, and Californian accessions, but these were not delimited as species because of occupying a common allele pool. Each comprises an ESU, warranting conservation considerations. This study represents perhaps the most geographically comprehensive example of integrative species delimitation for any orchid and any mycoheterotroph.

AB The sea urchin Heliocidaris erythrogramma (Valenciennes, 1846) is considered an ecologically important member of shallow sub-tidal reef assemblages across temperate Australia. However, defining its ecological role has remained elusive due to a paucity of evidence demonstrating the ability of this species to graze and maintain sea urchin barrens. Here we present critical evidence for a grazing effect of H. erythrogramma at typically observable densities (similar to 4-6 individuals m(-2)) by demonstrating recovery of canopy-forming brown algae following two controlled removals of the sea urchin from ostensibly barrens reef at sheltered locations in eastern Tasmania. In experimental plots where H. erythrogramma was removed, canopy-forming algae gradually recovered to demonstrate an average 5 times (ranging nil to 10 times) increase in percentage cover at 24 months post manipulation (chiefly driven by the habitat-formers Cystophora spp., Macrocystis pyrifera, Acrocarpia paniculata, and Sargassum spp.). While divergence in the overall algal community was indicated by both experiments, a statistically significant shift, based on percentage cover community data, was observed for only one location at 24 months post sea urchin removal, suggesting that a complete canopy-driven shift in community structure will be gradual and will be contingent on urchin density remaining below approximately 1.5 m(-2) in the longer term. The relatively slow and highly variable rates of algal recovery across plots suggests that seasonal coexistence of annual (chiefly filamentous algae) and some perennial macroalgae on H. erythrogramma barrens is likely due to a relatively low and variable intensity of selective grazing. We conclude that H. erythrogramma, at sufficient densities, is capable of grazing and maintaining a sea urchin barrens state however this phenomenon is observed to manifest in sheltered waters only. In contrast, H. erythrogramma occurring on exposed Tasmanian reefs achieves similar densities but here barrens are not observed and the sea urchin occurs cryptically within crevices and, consistent with experiments elsewhere in Australia, the sea urchin under these conditions appears to feed exclusively on an abundance of detached 'drift' macroalgae. Top-down and bottom-up factors leading to increased abundance of H. erythrogramma will be important in determining the potential influence of this enigmatic grazer on rocky reef communities, however critical tests of mechanisms controlling the switch between foraging modes are needed. Taken together, correlative patterns and results of experimental removals across the range of H. erythrogramma demonstrate that models of temperate Australian reef dynamics must account for the highly context-dependent effects of sea urchin foraging.

AB Rivers provide an excellent system to study interactions between patterns of biodiversity structure and ecological processes. In these environments, gene flow is restricted by the spatial hierarchy and temporal variation of connectivity within the drainage network. In the Australian arid zone, this variability is high and rivers often exist as isolated waterholes connected during unpredictable floods. These conditions cause boom/bust cycles in the population dynamics of taxa, but their influence on spatial genetic diversity is largely unknown. We used a landscape genetics approach to assess the effect of hydrological variability on gene flow, spatial population structure and genetic diversity in an Australian freshwater fish, Macquaria ambigua. Our analysis is based on microsatellite data of 590 samples from 26 locations across the species range. Despite temporal isolation of populations, the species showed surprisingly high rates of dispersal, with population genetic structure only evident among major drainage basins. Within drainages, hydrological variability was a strong predictor of genetic diversity, being positively correlated with spring-time flow volume. We propose that increases in flow volume during spring stimulate recruitment booms and dispersal, boosting population size and genetic diversity. Although it is uncertain how the hydrological regime in arid Australia may change under future climate scenarios, management strategies for arid-zone fishes should mitigate barriers to dispersal and alterations to the natural flow regime to maintain connectivity and the species' evolutionary potential. This study contributes to our understanding of the influence of spatial and temporal heterogeneity on population and landscape processes.

AB Unreliable and data-poor marine fishery landings can lead to a lack of regulatory action in fisheries management. Here we use official Chilean landing reports and non-conventional indicators, such as fishers' perceptions and spearfishing competition results, to provide evidence of reef fishes depletions caused by unregulated spearfishing. Results show that the three largest and most emblematic reef fishes targeted mainly by spearfishers (>98% of landings) [Graus nigra (vieja negra), Semicossyphus darwini (sheephead or pejeperro), and Medialuna ancietae (acha)] show signs of depletion in terms of abundance and size and that overall the catches of reef fishes have shifted from large carnivore species toward smaller-sized omnivore and herbivore species. Information from two snorkeling speargun world championships (1971 and 2004, Iquique, Chile) and from fishers' perceptions shows the mean size of reef fish to be declining. Although the ecological consequences of reef fish depletion are not fully understood in Chile, evidence of spearfishing depleting temperate reef fishes must be explicitly included in policy debates. This would involve bans or strong restrictions on the use of SCUBA and hookah diving gear for spearfishing, and minimum size limits. It may also involve academic and policy discussions regarding conservation and fisheries management synergies within networks of no-take and territorial user-rights fisheries areas, as a strategy for the sustainable management of temperate and tropical reef fisheries.

AB Standardized methods are required to measure ecosystem services in order to value them. In this paper, we argue that the service-providing unit (SPU) concept may help achieve this objective by promoting the systematic quantification of the key components of nature that provide services (e.g., population density of a key pollinator) and linking these with measurable outcomes for human well-being. We discuss and provide examples of the potential role of the SPU concept in improving economic valuation of ecosystem services. Further, we suggest the concept may contribute to addressing the endpoint problem, which can be defined simply as the inability of researchers to communicate the implications of environmental change in a way that is understood by a broad cross-section of society. The endpoint problem is of particular relevance to stated preference approaches, and we discuss the capacity of the SPU concept to refine these approaches. We argue that the concept enhances interdisciplinary collaboration, promoting more validated, well-informed valuation applications. It also has the potential to minimize 'warm glow effects' and put the notion of marginal changes in the provision of ecosystem services in a new light. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The life-history strategies of some species make them strong candidates for rapid exploitation of novel habitat under new climate regimes. Some early-responding species may be considered invasive, and negatively impact on 'naive' ecosystems. The barrens-forming sea urchin Centrostephanus rodgersii is one such species, having a high dispersal capability and a high-latitude range margin limited only by a developmental temperature threshold. Within this species' range in eastern Australian waters, sea temperatures have increased at greater than double the global average rate. The coinciding poleward range extension of C. rodgersii has caused major ecological changes, threatening reef biodiversity and fisheries productivity. We investigated microsatellite diversity and population structure associated with range expansion by this species. Generalized linear model analyses revealed no reduction in genetic diversity in the newly colonized region. A 'seascape genetics' analysis of genetic distances found no spatial genetic structure associated with the range extension. The distinctive genetic characteristic of the extension zone populations was reduced population-specific F-ST, consistent with very rapid population expansion. Demographic and genetic simulations support our inference of high connectivity between pre- and post-extension zones. Thus, the range shift appears to be a poleward extension of the highly-connected rangewide population of C. rodgersii. This is consistent with advection of larvae by the intensified warm water East Australian current, which has also increased Tasmanian Sea temperatures above the species' lower developmental threshold. Thus, ocean circulation changes have improved the climatic suitability of novel habitat for C. rodgersii and provided the supply of recruits necessary for colonization.

AB We studied the vegetation, testate amoebae and abiotic variables (depth of the water table, pH, electrical conductivity, Ca and Mg concentrations of water extracted from mosses) along the bog to extremely rich fen gradient in sub-alpine peatlands of the Upper Engadine (Swiss Alps). Testate amoeba diversity was correlated to that of mosses but not of vascular plants. Diversity peaked in rich fen for testate amoebae and in extremely rich fen for mosses, while for testate amoebae and mosses it was lowest in bog but for vascular plants in extremely rich fen. Multiple factor and redundancy analyses (RDA) revealed a stronger correlation of testate amoebae than of vegetation to water table and hydrochemical variables and relatively strong correlation between testate amoeba and moss community data. In RDA, hydrochemical variables explained a higher proportion of the testate amoeba and moss data than water table depth. Abiotic variables explained a higher percentage of the species data for testate amoebae (30.3% or 19.5% for binary data) than for mosses (13.4%) and vascular plants (10%). These results show that (1) vascular plant, moss and testate amoeba communities respond differently to ecological gradients in peatlands and (2) testate amoebae are more strongly related than vascular plants to the abiotic factors at the mire surface. These differences are related to vertical trophic gradients and associated niche differentiation.

AB Aim
   The highly adaptable estuarine crab (Carcinus maenas) has successfully invaded five temperate geographic regions outside of its native Europe. Here, we determine which environmental factors predict the current distribution of C. maenas and what the potential geographic range of this species might be. We also investigated whether the invasion potential of C. maenas differs with respect to the origin of a native subpopulation.
   Location
   Models were developed using global observation records of C. maenas.
   Methods
   Boosted regression trees were used to model observations from the (1) native, (2) invasive, (3) southern European, (4) northern European and (5) the combined native and invasive geographic ranges of C. maenas.
   Results
   Most established invasions were predicted mainly based on temperature. Interestingly, the environment encountered by established invasions failed to predict the majority of northern European populations; suggesting that invasion potential may differ between distinct native populations. Supporting this suggestion, a model of northern European populations, distinguished from southern European populations based on genetic structure, only predicted established invasions south of Nova Scotia. By contrast, a model of southern European populations predicted most established invasions.
   Main conclusions
   These results suggest that invasion potential depends on the European origin of an invasive population and that most invasions have arisen from southern Europe. Finally, a model based on combined native and invasive ranges of C. maenas identified potential geographic range extension along many currently invaded coastlines and the potential invasion of countries like Chile, China, Russia, Namibia and New Zealand.

AB Hydropower development brings many negative impacts on watershed ecosystems which are not fully integrated into current decision-making largely because in practice few accept the cost and benefit beyond market. In this paper, a framework was proposed to valuate the effects on watershed ecosystem services caused by hydropower development. Watershed ecosystem services were classified into four categories of provisioning, regulating, cultural and supporting services; then effects on watershed ecosystem services caused by hydropower development were identified to 21 indicators. Thereafter various evaluation techniques including the market value method, opportunity cost approach, project restoration method, travel cost method, and contingent valuation method were determined and the models were developed to valuate these indicators reflecting specific watershed ecosystem services. This approach was applied to three representative hydropower projects (Daguan, Xizaikou and Tiangong) of Jiulong River Watershed in southeast China. It was concluded that for hydropower development: (1) the value ratio of negative impacts to positive benefits ranges from 64.09% to 91.18%, indicating that the negative impacts of hydropower development should be critically Studied during its environmental administration process; (2) the biodiversity loss and water quality degradation (together accounting for 80-94%) are the major negative impacts on watershed ecosystem services: (3) the average environmental cost per unit of electricity is up to 0.206 Yuan/kW h, which is about three quarters of its on-grid power tariff; and (4) the current water resource fee accounts for only about 4% of its negative impacts value, therefore a new compensatory method by paying for ecosystem services is necessary for sustainable hydropower development. These findings provide a clear picture of both positive and negative effects of hydropower development for decision-makers in the monetary term, and also provide a basis for further design of environmental instrument such as payment for watershed ecosystem services.

AB Disturbance from floods and/or low flows is a pervading force in almost all benthic riverine communities around the world. As such the study of disturbance effects on benthic communities has been a dominant theme of research in benthic river ecology. Many of these studies have been phenomenological or have evaluated hypotheses developed in other areas of ecology. These studies have provided considerable weight to move the common view of ecological communities in general as deterministically structured, to one where stochastic disturbances can be the dominant structuring force in many communities. Benthic river studies investigating the link between disturbance and diversity have generally failed to find support for single variable hypotheses, such as the intermediate disturbance hypothesis, from other areas of ecology, however, river ecologists have been among the first to embrace multivariate models of diversity. The highly mobile, larval life history stage of many riverine invertebrates makes many of the hypotheses generated in general ecology inappropriate for benthic river communities; however, the recently popularized neutral models may prove to be good descriptors of these communities. Food web structure studies indicate riverine webs respond differently to disturbance from the way predicted by ecological theory. The contribution of studies of disturbance in benthic ecology to general ecology has to date been rather limited with some notable exceptions. However, the ubiquity of floods in rivers worldwide offers fertile ground for future contributions that could substantially advance this area of ecology. Benthic river ecologists need to resist the temptation to simply show general ecological models often do not work in streams, and need to develop their own models, which in turn may feed back to wider ecology.

AB The biogeographic patterns in sexually reproducing animals in island archipelagos may be interpreted as reflecting the importance of allopatric speciation. However, as the forms are allopatric, their reproductive isolation is largely untestable. A historical perspective integrating geology and molecular phylogeny reveals specific cases where ancient precursor islands coalesce, which allows the application of population genetics to critically test genetic isolation. The Anolis populations on Martinique in the Lesser Antilles are one such case where species-level populations on ancient precursor islands (ca 6-8 Myr BP) have met relatively recently. The distribution of the mtDNA lineages is tightly linked to the precursor island, but the population genetic analysis of microsatellite variation in large samples shows no evidence of restricted genetic exchange between these forms in secondary contact. This tests, and rejects, the hypothesis of simple allopatric speciation in these forms. By contrast, Martinique has pronounced environmental zonation, to which anoles are known to adapt. The population genetic analysis shows restricted genetic exchange across the ecotone between xeric coastal habitat and montane rainforest. This does not indicate full ecological speciation in these forms, but it does suggest the relative importance of the role of ecology in speciation in general.

AB A series of experiments was conducted oil rice seedlings in a nursery seedbed and after transplanting in order to understand root and shoot characteristics, and their contribution to the production of tillers and dry matter. At the nursery stage, the seedlings' were studied at varying densities (high and low) and fertilizer treatments (with and without nitrogen) at 12 and 24 days after sowing (DAS) in wet or (It), seedbeds. After transplanting, the effects of seedling age at the time of transplanting (12 and 30 days), method of raising seedlings (dry or wet seedbed) and water regimes (flooded or non-flooded) were studied. The overall aim was to understand the benefits, if any of this system of rice intensification (SRI) management practices over conventional methods. The study revealed that in a nursery at 12 DAS, rice seedlings raised in a city seedbed, irrespective of seeding density and fertilizer application, showed accelerated growth with better shoot and root characteristics in terms of greater leaf number, plant height, lateral root formation and elongation, and dry mass compared to seedlings grown in it wet seedbed. At 24 DAS, a significant interaction between seeding density and fertilizer application was found for dry-seedbed plants compared to those grown in a wet seedbed. Poor shoot and root growth was seen in older seedlings grown without fertilizer. Seedling age was found to be the most important factor affecting both shoot characteristics after transplanting (number of tillers, plant height, dry matter production) and root characteristics (root length density, root weight density). Younger seedlings performed better than older seedlings transplanted into either flooded or non-flooded soils with greater uptake of nitrogen and manganese than older seedlings. These results indicate that many of the constraints previously associated with non-flooded rice Cultivation may be alleviated by transplanting younger seedlings that have been raised by SRI methods.

AB The phylogenetic relationships of species are fundamental to any biological investigation, including all evolutionary studies. Accurate inferences of sister group relationships provide the researcher with an historical framework within which the attributes or geographic origin of species (or supraspecific groups) evolved. Taken out of this phylogenetic context, interpretations of evolutionary processes or origins, geographic distributions, or speciation rates and mechanisms, are subject to nothing less than a biological experiment without controls. Cypriniformes is the most diverse clade of freshwater fishes with estimates of diversity of nearly 3,500 species. These fishes display an amazing array of morphological, ecological, behavioral, and geographic diversity and offer a tremendous opportunity to enhance our understanding of the biotic and abiotic factors associated with diversification and adaptation to environments. Given the nearly global distribution of these fishes, they serve as an important model group for a plethora of biological investigations, including indicator species for future climatic changes. The occurrence of the zebrafish, Danio rerio, in this order makes this clade a critical component in understanding and predicting the relationship between mutagenesis and phenotypic expressions in vertebrates, including humans. With the tremendous diversity in Cypriniformes, our understanding of their phylogenetic relationships has not proceeded at an acceptable rate, despite a plethora of morphological and more recent molecular studies. Most studies are pre-Hennigian in origin or include relatively small numbers of taxa. Given that analyses of small numbers of taxa for molecular characters can be compromised by peculiarities of long-branch attraction and nodal-density effect, it is critical that significant progress in our understanding of the relationships of these important fishes occurs with increasing sampling of species to mitigate these potential problems. The recent Cypriniformes Tree of Life initiative is an effort to achieve this goal with morphological and molecular (mitochondrial and nuclear) data. In this early synthesis of our understanding of the phylogenetic relationships of these fishes, all types of data have contributed historically to improving our understanding, but not all analyses are complementary in taxon sampling, thus precluding direct understanding of the impact of taxon sampling on achieving accurate phylogenetic inferences. However, recent molecular studies do provide some insight and in some instances taxon sampling can be implicated as a variable that can influence sister group relationships. Other instances may also exist but without inclusion of more taxa for both mitochondrial and nuclear genes, one cannot distinguish between inferences being dictated by taxon sampling or the origins of the molecular data.

AB The study of turtle population genetics has come a long way in the past few decades. In the early 1990s, technologies such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and automated DNA sequencing spearheaded a boom in molecular ecology. Microsatellite and mitochondrial DNA haplotype markers became the methods of choice for many turtle studies. Today, the rate of research continues unabated. The emergence of new methods, approaches and ideas means exciting prospects for the molecular ecology of marine turtles. A review of genetic markers that have been used for turtle research provides a starting point for those breaking into this area for the first time. Here current molecular techniques are discussed, but upcoming new ideas and methods are also highlighted. A recently proposed hypothesis to explain the polyandrous behaviour of female turtles means a fresh direction for multiple paternity studies. A new statistical approach (individual-based analysis) offers future studies analytical methods other than F-statistics, and an alternative means to test male-biased gene flow. Paternity analysis now enables robust reconstruction of male genotypes from their offspring, elucidating the genetics of adult male turtles without collecting them in the field. With whole genome amplification (WGA) limited DNA samples can be amplified for long-terns storage, large-scale analyses and easy exchange between laboratories. New genetic markers are essential for future progress, and breakthrough DNA sequencing technologies will facilitate marker discovery. The next-generation sequencing methods also means that the new `-omics' techniques of genomics and transcriptomics may in the future be applicable to marine turtle research. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

AB Habitat type and quality are recognised as important local determinants of species richness, but other processes operating at the landscape scale can also affect diversity patterns. The evidence regarding the relative importance of landscape context on vascular plants is diverse, and little is known about the effects of this complex factor in Alpine environments. Hence, the primary purpose of the study was to elucidate the relative effects of the determinants of plant species richness by decomposing the variation into local and landscape components. We sampled 99 hay meadows in the Italian Alps, and recorded 14 explanatory variables ascribed to three sets: two sets of local variables, meadow management and abiotic environment, and a set of landscape variables. Plant diversity was affected primarily by local determinants. Species richness tended to increase in less fertilised meadows, confirming the detrimental effect of intensive meadow management on plant diversity. Site conditions such as steep slopes also enhanced plant species richness, showing a most pronounced positive effect in meadows that were cut less frequently. As to the landscape determinants, a high proportion of urban elements affected species richness negatively probably due to further eutrophication. In contrast, an increased length of meadow edges had a positive effect, particularly in meadows located on shallow soils. Partitioning analyses revealed that the three sets of variables. showed relatively large shared effects with each other (over half of the total variation explained). In conclusion, the composition of the surrounding landscape had a lower impact on vascular plant species richness than did meadow management and local abiotic environment.

AB The potential trophic impact of introduced brook trout Salvelinus fontinalis on native brown trout Salmo trutta in a mountain stream (south-west France) was investigated using stable isotope analysis (SIA). The isotopic signatures (delta C-13 and delta N-15) of S. fontinalis were similar regardless of the absence or presence of S. trutta, and SIA mixing models revealed that S. fontinalis diet consisted mainly of terrestrial invertebrates. Conversely, a significant shift in S. trutta isotopic signatures (depletion of 1-6 parts per thousand delta C-13 and enrichment of 0-6 parts per thousand delta N-15) was observed in sympatry with S. fontinalis; this may be due to a dietary shift towards terrestrial invertebrates. Contrary to an expected dietary divergence in sympatry, an elevated level of dietary overlap was observed between the non-native and native salmonids when in co-occurrence. This dietary convergence is more likely to be due to behavioural interactions than to variations in food availability or fish displacements.

AB Human-induced habitat loss and degradation are major threats to wetland species as reflected in the fact that wetlands have declined by more than 50% in Europe and North America during the last century. Both current and historic land-use patterns are likely to be significant determinants of wetland species' distributions; however their relative importance is often unknown. We studied the importance of local (study pond) and landscape (current and 18th-century landscape) characteristics in explaining the occurrence and species richness of amphibians (Rana arvalis, Bufo bufo, and Triturus vulgaris) on the Swedish island of Gotland, where more than 40% of wetlands have been lost since the 18th century. Current local habitat characteristics were the strongest determinants of occurrence for all study species. Additionally, species occurrence was related to current and historic landscape characteristics, which generally explained equal amounts of the variation in species-occurrence data. The proportions of both current and historic arable land were negative determinants of amphibian occurrence and species richness, indicating that agricultural land use may have an overall negative impact on amphibians, and that amphibians may occur less frequently in areas with a long agricultural history. Likewise, historic forest area was positively related to B. bufo occurrence and species richness, whereas current forests had no significant effects, suggesting that there may be a lag in the response of amphibians to agriculture-mediated habitat loss. Our results suggest that historic land-use patterns may influence current amphibian populations and that inclusion of historic land-use information could be a valuable tool in future studies on amphibian-habitat relations.

AB Generalized additive models (GAMs) offer an alternative approach to developing habitat suitability functions; these models may resolve some of the criticisms that have been made of conventional habitat suitability criteria and the associated composite suitability index (CSI). The potential advantages of GAMs include the ability to (1) account for correlation among habitat variables, (2) include interactions among variables, (3) make quantitative predictions of abundance or probability of occurrence at given flows, and (4) identify sharp thresholds in habitat selection. We developed CSIs and GAMs for two data sets-abundance of benthic invertebrates (mayflies Deleatidium spp. and caddisflies Aoteapsyche spp.) and habitat selection of large brown trout Salmo trutta and rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss-and applied them in an instream habitat analysis. The GAMs performed only slightly better than CSIs. The GAMs for two of the four taxa examined (Deleatidium and brown trout) had strong negative velocity-depth interaction terms, although their inclusion improved the model fit only marginally. The main effect of negative velocity-depth interaction terms was to constrain model predictions in deep, fast-flowing water, and these GAMs gave more realistic results when applied to conditions beyond those from which they were developed (i.e., larger rivers or higher flows). The GAMs hold a number of potential advantages over conventional CSIs and offer an opportunity to develop more defensible habitat suitability models; ultimately, however, the performance of any model will be limited by the quality of the calibration data.

AB In population and conservation genetics, there is an overwhelming body of evidence that genetic diversity is lost over time in small populations. This idea has been supported by comparative studies showing that small populations have lower diversity than large populations. However, longitudinal studies reporting a decline in genetic diversity throughout the whole history of a given wild population are much less common. Here, we analysed changes in heterozygosity over time in an insular mouflon (Ovis aries) population founded by two individuals in 1957 and located on one of the most isolated locations in the world: the Kerguelen Sub-Antarctic archipelago. Heterozygosity measured using 25 microsatellite markers has actually increased over 46 years since the introduction, and exceeds the range predicted by neutral genetic models and stochastic simulations. Given the complete isolation of the population and the short period of time since the introduction, changes in genetic variation cannot be attributed to mutation or migration. Several lines of evidence suggest that the increase in heterozygosity with time may be attributable to selection. This study shows the importance of longitudinal genetic surveys for understanding the mechanisms that regulate genetic diversity in wild populations.

AB We investigated spatial patterns of synchrony among coral reef fish populations and environmental variables over an eight-year period on the Great Barrier Reef, Australia. Our aims were to determine the spatial scale of intra- and interspecific synchrony of fluctuations in abundance of nine damselfish species ( genus Pomacentrus) and assess whether environmental factors could have influenced population synchrony. All species showed intraspecific synchrony among populations on reefs separated by <= 100 km, and interspecific synchrony was also common at this scale. At greater spatial scales, only four species showed intraspecific synchrony, over distances ranging from 100-300 km to 500-800 km, and no cases of interspecific synchrony were recorded. The two mechanisms most likely to cause population synchrony are dispersal and environmental forcing through regionally correlated climate ( the Moran effect). Dispersal may have influenced population synchrony over distances up to 100 km as this is the expected spatial range for ecologically significant reef fish dispersal. Environmental factors are also likely to have synchronized population fluctuations via the Moran effect for three reasons: ( 1) dispersal could not have caused interspecific synchrony that was common over distances <= 100 km because dispersal cannot link populations of different species, ( 2) variations in both sea surface temperature and wind speed were synchronized over greater spatial scales (>800 km) than fluctuations in damselfish abundance ( <= 800 km) and were correlated with an index of global climate variability, the El Nino-Southern Oscillation ( ENSO), and ( 3) synchronous population fluctuations of most damselfish species were correlated with ENSO; large population increases often followed ENSO events. We recorded regional variations in the strength of population synchrony that we suspect are due to spatial differences in geophysical, oceanographic, and population characteristics, which act to dilute or enhance the effects of synchronizing mechanisms. We conclude that synchrony is common among Pomacentrus populations separated by tens of kilometers but less prevalent at greater spatial scales, and that environmental variation linked to global climate is likely to be a driving force behind damselfish population synchrony at all spatial scales on the Great Barrier Reef.

AB Ecological niche modeling has become an increasingly important tool to address issues in many fields of basic and applied ecology. The ecological niche space occupied across the geographic range, particularly for wide-ranging species, may vary for a variety of evolutionary and non-evolutionary reasons. However, ecological niche models are often applied over large geographic areas without regard for the potential effects of regional variation in adaptation, environmental conditions and their interactions, and species responses, thus significantly reducing their accuracy and utility. We develop regionally partitioned ecological niche models, using GARP, for the wide-ranging North American tree Gleditsia triacanthos (Fabaceae). Models were constructed based on known tree occurrences at peripheral and range-centre locations, as well as across the geographic range as a whole. Our results suggest that the niche space occupied by G. triacanthos varies regionally and that between some regions in particular there may be a complete absence of niche overlap. In particular, while there is some overlap between the niche space occupied by trees in the western and central regions of the range, there appears to be virtually no overlap in the niche space occupied by trees in the south of the range and that occupied by western and central trees. This lack of overlap appears to be driven primarily by regional differences in abiotic conditions, rather than regional adaptation per se. The results of our study have several important implications for the future development of habitat suitability models over large geographic areas. Spatial partitioning of data is clearly necessary to improve predictions of models where regional niche variation occurs. For wide-ranging species in particular, regional differences in ecological characteristics may cause apparent niche variation.

AB To investigate patterns of polyandry in the sandbar shark (Carcharhinus plumbeus), 20 pregnant females were sampled from the western North Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico. Five species-specific microsatellite markers were used to genotype each shark and its litter. Of 20 litters, 17 (85%) were shown to have multiple sires. In multiply sired litters, the estimated minimum number of sires ranged from two to five with an average of 2.3 males per litter. Regression analysis did not demonstrate a significant relationship between female reproductive success and female body size or sire number and female body size. There was a high incidence of reproductive skew noted in litters, and two groups of males with significantly different mean reproductive success were observed. Analyses using Bateman's principles suggest that there is less direct benefit for females that acquire multiple mates than for males who bias paternity within litters. In light of past morphological and behavioural studies, these data suggest that patterns of polyandry in elasmobranchs may be determined by coercive mating, and that breeding behaviour has likely evolved in the context of sexual conflict.

AB The spiny lobster Palinurus delagoae inhabits the deep shelf waters and oceanic ridges of the southwestern Indian Ocean, where it supports commercial fisheries. To investigate population structure and the physical processes that may have influenced female gene flow in this species, a portion of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region (547 base pairs) was sequenced for 285 lobsters from the southeastern coast of Africa (6 sites) and 49 lobsters from Walters Shoals, a submerged seamount on the Madagascar Ridge. Lobsters from these 2 areas shared no haplotypes and differed by at least 27 mutational steps. An analysis of molecular variance showed significant genetic partitioning, and pairwise comparisons suggested that lobsters from Walters Shoals are distinct from those of other sampling areas. There was shallow genetic partitioning between 4 southern sites (South Africa) and 2 northern sites (Mozambique), suggesting 2 Management Units along the African coast. A mismatch distribution and Fu's F-test indicated fairly recent demographic changes within populations, consistent with that found in the sister species P. gilchristi. Female gene flow along the African coast may be propagated by larval dispersal in the Mozambique and Agulhas Currents and countercurrent migrations by benthic juveniles along the shelf, but the mtDNA data strongly suggest that larvae at Walters Shoals have been, or are currently still retained by other oceanographic processes. The magnitude of mtDNA divergence among lobsters from the southeastern coast of Africa and those at Walters Shoals, together with the absence of any shared haplotypes between these regions strongly suggest that these 2 taxa might in fact represent distinct species.

AB Caribbean Anolis lizards are a classic case of adaptive radiation, repeated four times across islands of the Greater Antilles. On each island, very similar patterns of evolutionary divergence have occurred, resulting in the evolution of the same set of ecological specialists-termed ecomorphs-on each island. However, this is only part of the story of the Caribbean anole radiation,;. Indeed, much of the species diversity of Caribbean Anolis occurs within clades of ecomorphs, which contain as many as 14 ecologically-similar species on a single island. We ask to what extent the classic model of ecological interactions as the driving force in adaptive radiation can account for this aspect of anole evolutionary diversity. Our answer is that it can in part, but riot entirely. More generally, the most complete understanding of evolutionary diversification and radiation is achieved by studying multiple hierarchical evolutionary levels from clades to populations.

AB The distribution and abundance of the greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) have declined dramatically, and as a result the species has become the focus of conservation efforts. We conducted a range-wide genetic survey of the species which included 46 populations and over 1000 individuals using both mitochondrial sequence data and data from seven nuclear microsatellites. Nested clade and STRUCTURE analyses revealed that, in general, the greater sage-grouse populations follow an isolation-by-distance model of restricted gene flow. This suggests that movements of the greater sage-grouse are typically among neighbouring populations and not across the species, range. This may have important implications if management is considering translocations as they should involve neighbouring rather than distant populations to preserve any effects of local adaptation. We identified two populations in Washington with low levels of genetic variation that reflect severe habitat loss and dramatic population decline. Managers of these populations may consider augmentation from geographically close populations. One population (Lyon/Mono) on the southwestern edge of the species' range appears to have been isolated from all other greater sage-grouse populations. This population is sufficiently genetically distinct that it warrants protection and management as a separate unit. The genetic data presented here, in conjunction with large-scale demographic and habitat data, will provide an integrated approach to conservation efforts for the greater sage-grouse.

AB The construction of predictive models of species distribution for conservation and regional planning can be facilitated by automatic procedures employed for the selection and transformation of predictors. It has been claimed, however, that empirical predictive models benefit from the inclusion of expert opinion at different stages of the model-building process. This is a time-consuming task that is limited by the availability of experts and difficult to standardize. Automated procedures for predictor selection based on statistical criteria are faster and easier to integrate into a geographic information system and may render highly explanatory models that fit the data with which they were built. But these models do not necessarily predict independent observations well and cannot be used to extrapolate to other areas. On the contrary, supervised models may include more frequently causal relationships, and therefore may more accurately predict new observations and extrapolate better to other areas. We built predictive models for the presence/absence of 10 bird species in two areas of Andalusia (southwestern Spain) to compare three different procedures for predictor selection ranging from a completely unsupervised to a fully supervised method. We evaluated models in three ways: (1) with the same data used to build the models, (2) with a different evaluation data set, and (3) with data from a different geographic area. The increase in the degree of expert input during model construction resulted in a significant decrease of model predictive ability when evaluated with an independent data set, and did not improve the predictive ability of the model when transferred to a new area. Unsupervised models had a greater tendency to overfit the building data, but this did not negatively affect model predictive ability or transferability to a new area. Incorporating expert opinion in the model-building process neither rendered better models as measured by their predictive ability nor resulted in models that were better suited to other regions. Therefore, unsupervised fitting procedures seem to be an adequate and cost-effective way to proceed when the aim is to generate potential distribution maps of species in a regional context.

AB We investigated the effects of predator diet breadth on the relative importance of bottom-up and top-down control of prey assemblages, using microbial food webs containing bacteria, bacterivorous protists and rotifers, and two different top predators. The experiment used a factorial design that independently manipulated productivity and the presence or absence of two top predators with different diet breadths. Predators included a "specialist" predatory ciliate Euplotes aediculatus, which was restricted to feeding on small prey, and a "generalist" predatory ciliate Stentor coeruleus, which could feed on the entire range of prey sizes. Both total prey biomass and prey diversity increased with productivity in the predator-free control and specialist predator treatments, a pattern consistent with bottom-up control, but both remained unchanged by productivity in the generalist predator treatment, a pattern consistent with topdown control. Linear food chain models adequately described responses in the generalist predator treatment, whereas food web models incorporating edible and inedible prey ( which can coexist in the absence of predators) adequately described responses in the specialist predator treatment. These results suggest that predator diet breadth can play an important role in modulating the relative strength of bottom-up and top-down forces in ecological communities.

AB 1. Roadless areas on United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service lands hold significant potential for the conservation of native biodiversity and ecosystem processes, primarily because of their size and location. We examined the potential increase in land-cover types, elevation representation and landscape connectivity that inventoried roadless areas would provide in a northern Rockies (USA) conservation reserve strategy, if these roadless areas received full protection.
   2 For the northern Rocky Mountain states of Montana, Wyoming and Idaho, USA, we obtained GIS data on land-cover types and a digital elevation model. We calculated the percentage of land-cover types and elevation ranges of current protected areas (wilderness, national parks and national wildlife refuges) and compared these with the percentages calculated for roadless and protected areas combined. Using five landscape metrics and corresponding statistics, we quantified how roadless areas, when assessed with current protected areas, affect three elements of landscape connectivity: area, isolation and aggregation.
   3. Roadless areas, when added to existing federal-protected areas in the northern Rockies, increase the representation of virtually all land-cover types, some by more than 100%, and increase the protection of relatively undisturbed lower elevation lands, which are exceedingly rare in the northern Rockies. In fact, roadless areas protect more rare and declining land-cover types, such as aspen, whitebark pine, sagebrush and grassland communities, than existing protected areas.
   4. Synthesis and applications. Landscape metric results for the three elements of landscape connectivity (area, isolation and aggregation) demonstrate how roadless areas adjacent to protected areas increase connectivity by creating larger and more cohesive protected area 'patches.' Roadless areas enhance overall landscape connectivity by reducing isolation among protected areas and creating a more dispersed conservation reserve network, important for maintaining wide-ranging species movements. We advocate that the USDA Forest Service should retain the Roadless Area Conservation Rule and manage roadless areas as an integral part of the conservation reserve network for the northern Rockies.

AB One of the major issues confronting management of parks and reserves is the invasion of non-native plant species. Yosemite National Park is one of the largest and best-known parks in the United States, harbouring significant cultural and ecological resources. Effective management of non-natives would be greatly assisted by information on their potential distribution that can be generated by predictive modelling techniques. Our goal was to identify key environmental factors that were correlated with the percent cover of non-native species and then develop a predictive model using the Genetic Algorithm for Rule-set Production technique. We performed a series of analyses using community-level data on species composition in 236 plots located throughout the park. A total of 41 non-native species were recorded which occurred in 23.7% of the plots. Plots with non-natives occurred most frequently at low- to mid-elevations, in flat areas with other herbaceous species. Based on the community-level results, we selected elevation, slope, and vegetation structure as inputs into the GARP model to predict the environmental niche of non-native species. Verification of results was performed using plot data reserved from the model, which calculated the correct prediction of non-native species occurrence as 76%. The majority of the western, lower-elevation portion of the park was predicted to have relatively low levels of non-native species occurrence, with highest concentrations predicted at the west and south entrances and in the Yosemite Valley. Distribution maps of predicted occurrences will be used by management to: efficiently target monitoring of non-native species, prioritize control efforts according to the likelihood of non-native occurrences, and inform decisions relating to the management of non-native species in postfire environments. Our approach provides a valuable tool for assisting decision makers to better manage non-native species, which can be readily adapted to target non-native species in other locations.

AB Pasture productivity under harsh environments can be increased by planting more drought-resistant species or by increasing species diversity. This research was conducted under two large (10.2 x 26.8 m) rainout shelters combined with a drip irrigation system to provide deficit, normal, and excessive moisture conditions. A two-species mixture containing the relatively drought-tolerant species, orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata L.) and red clover (Trifolium pretense L.) and two five-species mixtures were compared with a mixture containing the drought-sensitive species, white clover (Trifolium repens L.) and Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis L.), which are the predominant species in northeastern USA pastures. Plots were clipped from mid-May to early October in 2000 and 2001 on a schedule that mimicked management-intensive grazing practices. The five-species mixture containing chicory (Cichorium intybus L.), orchardgrass, Kentucky bluegrass, perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.), and white clover had the greatest dry matter yield at all moisture levels. Yield in that mixture increased 89% in the dry, 61% in the normal, and 43% (by weight) in the wet treatments compared with the white clover/ Kentucky bluegrass mixture. Increased yield was primarily due to the robust growth of chicory which dominated the mixture, accounting for 71% of harvested biomass by the fall of 2001. In addition, white clover growing in the mixture with chicory had improved leaf water relations and greater relative growth rates than white clover growing in the two-species mixture. Including the functional attribute of a deep-rooted forb appeared to be more important than species richness, per se, in improving forage yield.

AB 1. Counts of road traffic casualties (RTCs) have been proposed as one potential method of monitoring changes in the abundance of several mammal species in Britain. However, before such schemes are implemented, it is vital that the relationship between animal density and RTCs is verified and quantified. In this paper, we analyse data collected as part of a long-term study of red foxes Vulpes vulpes in Bristol, UK to determine whether RTCs reflected changes in fox numbers.
   2. Associations between fox density and RTC counts were examined using data collected from throughout Bristol during 1978-84 (spatial model) and from an intensive longitudinal study in the north-west of the city during 1990-94 (temporal model). For both sets of data, there was a significant relationship between fox density and RTCs; in the case of the temporal model, this was only evident after the data had been manipulated by calculating running means across seasons. These regression models only explained 58% and 43% of the variance observed in the data, respectively.
   3. In both analyses, there was a significant difference between the distribution of casualties and the availability of different road types; more foxes were killed on major category roads (e.g. motorways, A-roads). Incorporating the length of each road category in each region in the spatial model improved the variance explained to 81%. This level of precision would be sufficient for a national monitoring programme. However, we were able to minimize or eliminate a number of factors that could potentially confound the use of RTCs for a national monitoring programme; these factors are discussed in detail. At present, we conclude that further investigation into the validity and precision of this technique is required for a range of mammal species before it could be used in a national monitoring programme.

AB The vairone Leuciscus souffia is a cyprinid fish that inhabits river systems in and around the Alps. The complete mitochondrial DNA control region (945 bp) was sequenced in 295 vairone from 22 populations in Central Europe. A total of 51 haplotypes were identified with a maximum pairwise distance between haplotypes of 5.6%. Phylogenetic analyses revealed two major clades in L. souffia, an 'Italian' clade, and an 'Alpine' clade. Two hybrid zones exist, in the Mediterranean Alps and in the Soca basin. The position of the sister species of L. souffia, L. turskyi, to the 'Alpine' and the 'Italian' clade could not be resolved unambiguously. However, a linearized tree analysis indicated that L. turskyi represents a third lineage, that originated at the same time as the 'Alpine' and the 'Italian' clades of L. souffia. In the 'Alpine' clade two groups were resolved, a subclade with haplotypes from the Rhone and Var basins and a cluster with haplotypes from the Danube and Rhine systems. Our data suggest a long history of the vairone in Central Europe, predating Pleistocene glacial cycles. Two main refugia during glaciations must have existed, one in Italy and another one most probably in the Danube system. However, age estimates based on molecular clock calibrations suggest the survival of 'Alpine' haplotypes in several drainages during the last glaciation cycles. The Rhine system was only recently colonized.

AB The 30 living species of armadillos, anteaters, and sloths (Mammalia: Xenarthra) represent one of the three major clades of placentals. Armadillos (Cingulata: Dasypodidae) are the earliest and most speciose xenarthran lineage with 21 described species. The question of their tricky phylogeny was here studied by adding two mitochondrial genes (NADH dehydrogenase subunit 1 [ND 1] and 12S ribosomal RNA [12S rRNA]) to the three protein-coding nuclear genes (alpha2B adrenergic receptor [ADRA2B], breast cancer susceptibility exon 11 [BRCA1], and von Willebrand factor exon 28 [VWF]) yielding a total of 6869 aligned nucleotide sites for thirteen xenarthran species. The two mitochondrial genes were characterized by marked excesses of transitions over transversions-with a strong bias toward CT transitions for the 12S rRNA-and exhibited two- to fivefold faster evolutionary rates than the fastest nuclear gene (ADRA2B). Maximum likelihood and Bayesian phylogenetic analyses supported the monophyly of Dasypodinae, Tolypeutinae, and Euphractinae, with the latter two armadillo subfamilies strongly clustering together. Conflicting branching points between individual genes involved relationships within the subfamilies Tolypeutinae and Euphractinae. Owing to a greater number of informative sites. the overall concatenation favored the mitochondrial topology with the classical grouping of Cabassous and Priodontes within Tolypeutinae, and a close relationship between Euphractus and Chaetophractus within Euphractinae. However, low statistical support values associated with almost equal distributions of apomorphies among alternatives suggested that two parallel events of rapid speciation occurred within these two armadillo subfamilies.

AB Arctic foxes (Alopex lagopus) in Fennoscandia have retreated to higher altitudes on the mountain tundra, possibly because of increased competition with red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) at lower altitudes. In this study we compare summer food niches of the two species in mountain tundra habitat. Arctic foxes consumed lemmings more often than red foxes did, while red foxes consumed field voles and birds more often. Yet despite substantial variation in the diet of each species among summers, food-niche overlaps between the species were consistently high in most summers, as arctic and red foxes responded similarly to temporal changes in prey availability. Occurrences of field voles and birds in fox scats were negatively Correlated with altitude, while the occurrences of lemmings tended to increase with altitude. Since arctic foxes bred at higher altitudes than red foxes, the differences between arctic and red fox diets were better explained by altitudinal segregation than by differences between their fundamental food niches. Arctic foxes should therefore endeavour to use the more productive hunting grounds at the lower altitudes of their former range, but interference competition with red foxes might decrease their access to these areas, and consequently cause a decrease in the size of in their realised niche.

AB This study investigates hybridization and population genetics of two species of macaque monkey in Sulawesi, Indonesia, using molecular markers from mitochondrial, autosomal, and Y-chromosome DNA. Hybridization is the interbreeding of individuals from different parental taxa that are distinguishable by one or more heritable characteristics. Because hybridization can affect population structure of the parental taxa, it is an important consideration for conservation management. On the Indonesian island of Sulawesi an explosive diversification of macaques has occurred: seven of 19 species in the genus Macaca live on this island. The contact zone of the subjects of this study, M. maura and M. tonkeana, is located at the base of the southwestern peninsula of Sulawesi. Land conversion in Sulawesi is occurring at an alarming pace; currently two species of Sulawesi macaque, one of which is M. maura, are classified as endangered species. Results of this study indicate that hybridization among M. maura and M. tonkeana has led to different distributions of molecular variation in mitochondrial DNA and nuclear DNA in the contact zone; mitochondrial DNA shows a sharp transition from M. maura to M. tonkeana haplotypes, but nuclear DNA from the parental taxa is homogenized in a narrow hybrid zone. Similarly, within M. maura divergent mitochondrial DNA haplotypes are geographically structured but population subdivision in the nuclear genome is low or absent. In M. tonkeana, mitochondrial DNA haplotypes are geographically structured and a high level of nuclear DNA population subdivision is present in this species. These results are largely consistent with a macaque behavioral paradigm of female philopatry and obligate mate dispersal, suggest that introgression between M. maura and M. tonkeana is restricted to the hybrid zone. and delineate one conservation management unit in M. maura and at least two in M. tonkeana.

AB During copulation, males of Bombus terrestris fill the queen's sexual tract with a mating plug after transferring their sperm. The sticky secretion is produced by the male's accessory glands and disappears within a couple of days. Experiments now show that the primary function of the plug is to reduce the subsequent mating probability of the queen. The plug is not efficient in preventing sperm migration into the spermatheca. Due to its low energetic value, the plug is also unlikely to serve as a nuptial gift. This type of male interference with female mating propensity has so far not been found in social insects. This finding could, at least tentatively, explain why females of B. terrestris may not be able to take advantage of the demonstrated benefits of multiple mating. Furthermore, such male interference could be a more general phenomenon in social insects. with obvious ramifications for the evolution of polyandry in this group.

AB The phylogeny of Anisoptera, dragonflies in the strict sense, has proven to be notoriously difficult to resolve. Based on morphological characters, several recent publications dealing with the phylogeny of dragonflies proposed contradicting inter- and intrafamily relationships. We explored phylogenetic information content of mitochondrial large-subunit (LSU) and small-subunit (SSU) ribosomal gene fragments for these systematic problems. Starting at published universal primers, we developed primer sets suitable for amplifying large parts of the LSU and SSU rRNA genes within dragonflies. These fragments turned out to harbor sufficient phylogenetic information to satisfyingly resolve intrafamily relationships, but they contain insufficient phylogenetic structure to permit reliable conclusions about several interfamily relationships. We demonstrate that decay of phylogenetic signal progresses from intrafamily to interfamily to outgroup relationships and is correlated with an increase of genetic distances. As expected, signal decay is most pronounced in fast-changing sites. Additionally, base composition among fast-changing sites significantly deviates from the expected homogeneity. Homogeneity of base composition among all included taxa was restored only after removing fast-changing sites from the data set. The molecular data tentatively support interfamily relationships proposed by the most recent publication based on morphological characters of fossil and extant dragonflies.

AB Heterodera schachtii populations were introduced into nematode-suppressive and conducive field plots and were monitored for 2550 degree-days (DD). At 1200 DD, H. schachtii population densities significantly increased in conducive versus suppressive plots, up to 14-fold at termination of the trial. In greenhouse experiments with the same soil, H. schachtii female population densities were similar in suppressive and conducive soil in the first nematode generation but remained low in the suppressive soil compared to significant increase in conducive soil in the second generation. At termination of the experiment, ca. one third of the cysts, but no females from suppressive soil were infested with fungi, whereas fungal-infested females and cysts were rarely found in conducive soil. The most common fungi isolated from infested cysts were Fusarium oxysporum, Fusarium sp, nov., and Dactylella oviparasitica, Paecilomyces lilacinus and some nonidentified fungi occurred less frequently. Suppressiveness was transferred at a rate of one cyst from suppressive soil amended to 110 g of H. schachtii-infested conducive soil. Heat treatment of suppressive soil for 30 min at 55 degreesC eliminated H, schachtii suppressiveness and reduced F. oxysporum populations to the detection level. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Corn pot cultures with a pasteurized medium of two parts sand and one part sandy loam soil were grown in the greenhouse. Marigold plants inoculated or not with Glomus intraradices Schenck & Smith were used to establish an AMF hyphal network in the designated soil pots. Corn hybrids were seeded after removal of the marigold plant. Mycorrhizal colonization of corn hybrids and the quantity of extraradical hyphae produced in soil were greatest at the lowest P level and at the intermediate N level. Root colonization was correlated with shoot N/P ratio only at the intermediate N level. The shoot concentrations of P, Mg, Zn and Cu were significantly higher in mycorrhizal plants than in non-mycorrhizal plants. The corn phenotype with the highest shoot:root ratio had the highest root colonization. The corn hybrid with a leafy normal stature architecture had a greater mycorrhizal colonization than that of other two corn hybrids. This experiment showed that N level in soil influenced shoot N/P ratio, root colonization and extraradical hyphal production, which in turn influenced uptake of other nutrients.

AB Young coffee plants (Coffea arabica L. cv. Catuai), originally from a shaded habitat, were separated in three groups to be grown under different levels of N fertilization: 0.3 mmol N supplements were given to the soil every 7 days (high N treatment, 2N), every 15 days (medium N treatment, 1N) and every 45 days (low N treatment, 0N). These plants were later exposed to a high sunlight irradiance (noon PPFD up to 1500 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) for a period of 12 or 15 days. Among others, the values of electron transport capacity, maximum carboxylation activity, photosynthetic capacity (A(max)) and several fluorescence parameters (F-v/F-m, F-v'/F-m', q(P), phi(e)) first showed a reduction (until the 4th-7th day) in all N treatments, followed by an N-dependent recovery. The 2N plants were less affected in the first few days and, at the end of the stress period, showed a better recovery for most of the studied parameters and the highest increase in the saturating PPFD for net photosynthesis and Amax. The present work shows that the ability to acclimate displayed by the mature leaves of 2N plants was accompanied by an increase in energy dissipation mechanisms. These include an increase in the 'high energy' quenching and, mostly, the presence of higher contents of some xanthophylls (zeaxanthin and lutein) and carotenes, which helped to decrease the energetic overcharge in the photosystems. Pigment changes in mature leaves suggest that N can promote specific mechanisms of acclimation others than those that might be expected from a preferential partition of the element N into photosynthetic components.

AB The phylogeography of the California mountain kingsnake, Lampropeltis zonata, was studied using mitochondrial DNA sequences from specimens belonging to the seven recognized subspecies and collected throughout the range of the species. Maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood methods identified a basal split within L. zonata that corresponds to southern and northern segments of its distribution. The southern clade is composed of populations from southern California (USA) and northern Baja California, Mexico. The northern clade is divided into two subclades, a 'coastal' subclade, consisting of populations from the central coast of California and the southern Sierra Nevada Mountains of eastern California, and a 'northeastern' subclade, mainly comprised of populations north of the San Francisco Bay and from the majority of the Sierra Nevada. We suggest that past inland seaways in southwestern California and the embayment of central California constituted barriers to gene flow that resulted in the two deepest divergences within L. zonata. Throughout its evolutionary history, the northern clade apparently has undergone instances of range contraction, isolation, differentiation, and then expansion and secondary contact. Examination of colour pattern variation in 321 living and preserved specimens indicated that the two main colour pattern characters used to define the subspecies of L. zonata are so variable that they cannot be reliably used to differentiate taxonomic units within this complex, which calls into question the recognition of seven geographical races of this snake.

AB Input of individuals dispersing into open populations can be highly variable, yet the consequences of such variation for subsequent population densities are not well understood. I explored the influence of variable input (''supply'') on subsequent densities of juveniles and adults in open local populations of two temperate reef fishes, the bluebanded goby (Lythrypnus dalli) and the blackeye goby (Coryphopterus nicholsii). Variable recruitment was simulated by stocking a natural range of densities of young fishes on replicate patch reefs. Density and mortality of the stocked cohorts were followed over time, until the fishes reached maturity. Over the first day of the experiments, mortality of both species was significantly density-dependent; however, there was still a very strong relationship between density on day 1 and density on day 0 (i.e., simulated recruitment was still an excellent predictor of population density). At this point in the study, the main effects of density-dependent mortality were to reduce mean densities and variation about the mean. Over the;period from the start of the experiments until the time when maturity was reached by each species (about 1 and 3 months for Lythrypnus and Coryphopterus, respectively), mortality was strongly density-dependent. Such strong density-dependent mortality virtually eliminated any linear relationship between adult density and ''recruit'' density. However, for both species, the relationship between these two variables was well fit by an asymptotic curve, with the asymptotic density of adults equal to c. 3/m(2) for Coryphopterus, and c. 10/m(2) for Lythrypnus. Natural recruitment (via settlement of larvae) to the reefs over the period of the study (9 months) was above the asymptotic densities of adults for the two species, even though the study did not encompass the periods of peak annual recruitment of either species. This suggests that adult populations of these two gobies may often be limited, and regulated, by post-settlement processes, rather than by input of settlers. Other studies have shown that mortality of the two species is density-independent, or only weakly density-dependent, on reefs from which predators have been excluded. Hence, it appears that predators cause density-dependent mortality in these fishes.

DT Article
ID FOREST; MOUSE; MICE
AB Fluctuations in the composition and abundance of a small-mammal assemblage were studied in a hummock grassland dominated by Plectrachne schinzii at Watarrka National Park from 1988 to 1993. During this period an experiment was conducted to examine the short-term effects of fire on the rodents. We caught three species of rodent (Pseudomys hermansburgensis, Notomys alexis and Mus domesticus). All species reached their greatest density in spring 1989 during an exceptionally wet period that extended from mid-1988 to 1990. P. hermannsburgensis was the most abundant species and showed a 10-fold fluctuation in numbers over the sample period; N. alexis was the next most abundant species and showed a 5-fold increase but the population took longer to decline. M. domesticus was recorded only during the period of high rainfall. The number of M. domesticus was significantly less on the burnt plots than on the unburnt plots. Neither P. hermannsbursensis nor N. alexis showed significant differences between burnt and unburnt plots. This study illustrates the impact of rainfall events on the composition and density of small-mammal populations in spinifex grasslands in central Australia.
   Our results lead to the prediction that rodent populations will achieve densities in the order of 10 individuals ha(-1) or more in regions that experience three consecutive 6-month periods each with rainfall at 150% of the long-term average. This sequence apparently needs to follow a dry period where rainfall is no more than 85% of the long-term annual average for two consecutive 12-month periods.

AB Although Coffea arabica L. grows naturally in shaded habitats, it can be cultivated under high light intensity, but not without severe photoinhibition mainly during the period of transfer from the nursery into the field. The present work examines some of the changes in the photosynthetic performance induced by exposure to high light and the possibility of using enhanced nitrogen levels to overcome photoinhibition. For that purpose, young plants of Coffea arabica L. (cv. Catuai) grown in a shaded greenhouse were treated with 0, 1 and 2 mmol of nitrogen and 4 weeks later exposed to full solar irradiation, outside.
   Visible damage due to exposure to full sunlight appeared within 2 d in all plants, resulting in a reduced photosynthetic leaf area and drastic shedding of leaves in the unfertilized plants. These effects were considerably less in plants with the highest N dose. After 130 d of exposure, there was 100% mortality in plants receiving no extra nitrogen, compared with 30% in the plants treated with 2 mmol nitrogen. Photosynthesis rates, leaf conductance and transpiration presented minimum values after 4 d of light stress. Large changes in the photosynthetic capacity (measured at high CO2 concentration and high light intensity), quantum efficiency and fluorescence yield (F(v)/F(m)) indicate that net photosynthesis rate in the air had been reduced by both stomatal closure and by changes at the photochemical level. All indicators show that N-fertilized plants were less affected by photoinhibition.

AB Tropical vines in the Araceae family commonly exhibit alternating periods of upward and downward growth, decoupling the usual relationship between decreasing light environment with increasing age among the leaves on a shoot.  In this study I examined patterns of light, leaf specific mass, and leaf nitrogen concentration in relation to leaf position, a measure of developmental age, in field collected shoots of Syngonium podophyllum.  These data were analyzed to test the hypothesis that nitrogen allocation parallels within-shoot gradients of light availability, regardless of the relationship between light and leaf age.  I found that leaf nitrogen concentration, on a mass basis, was weakly correlated with leaf level light environment.  However, leaf specific mass, and consequently nitrogen per unit leaf area, were positively correlated with gradients of light within the shoot, and either increased or decreased with leaf age, providing support for the hypothesis that nitrogen allocation parallels gradients of light availability.

AB Biodiversity on marine islands is characterized by unique biogeographic, phylogenetic and functional characteristics. Islands hold a disproportionate amount of the world's biodiversity, and they have also experienced a disproportionate loss of it. Following human contact, island biodiversity has sustained negative human impacts increasing in rate and magnitude as islands transitioned from primary through secondary to tertiary economies. On islands, habitat transformation and invasive non-native species have historically been the major threats to biodiversity, and although these threats will continue in new forms, new impacts such as human-induced climate change and sea-level rise are emerging. Island biodiversity is changing with some species going extinct, others changing in abundance, non-native species becoming a part of many ecosystems, and humans shaping many ecological processes. Islands thus are microcosms for the emerging biodiversity and socioecological landscapes of the Anthropocene. Islands will require new strategies for the protection and restoration of their biodiversity, including maintaining biological and cultural heritage through regenerative practices, mainstreaming biodiversity in cultural and production landscapes, and engaging with the reality of novel ecosystems.

AB This paper introduces a modular processing chain to derive global high-resolution maps of leaf traits. In particular, we present global maps at 500 m resolution of specific leaf area, leaf dry matter content, leaf nitrogen and phosphorus content per dry mass, and leaf nitrogen/phosphorus ratio. The processing chain exploits machine learning techniques along with optical remote sensing data (MODIS/Landsat) and climate data for gap filling and up-scaling of in-situ measured leaf traits. The chain first uses random forests regression with surrogates to fill gaps in the database (> 45% of missing entries) and maximizes the global representativeness of the trait dataset. Plant species are then aggregated to Plant Functional Types (PFTs). Next, the spatial abundance of PFTs at MODIS resolution (500 m) is calculated using Landsat data (30 m). Based on these PFT abundances, representative trait values are calculated for MODIS pixels with nearby trait data. Finally, different regression algorithms are applied to globally predict trait estimates from these MODIS pixels using remote sensing and climate data. The methods were compared in terms of precision, robustness and efficiency. The best model (random forests regression) shows good precision (normalized RMSE <= 20%) and goodness of fit (averaged Pearson's correlation R = 0.78) in any considered trait. Along with the estimated global maps of leaf traits, we provide associated uncertainty estimates derived from the regression models. The process chain is modular, and can easily accommodate new traits, data streams (traits databases and remote sensing data), and methods. The machine learning techniques applied allow attribution of information gain to data input and thus provide the opportunity to understand trait-environment relationships at the plant and ecosystem scales. The new data products the gap-filled trait matrix, a global map of PFT abundance per MODIS gridcells and the high-resolution global leaf trait maps are complementary to existing large-scale observations of the land surface and we therefore anticipate substantial contributions to advances in quantifying, understanding and prediction of the Earth system.

AB Life-history theory posits that trade-offs between demographic rates constrain the range of viable life-history strategies. For coexisting tropical tree species, the best established demographic trade-off is the growth-survival trade-off. However, we know surprisingly little about co-variation of growth and survival with measures of reproduction. We analysed demographic rates from seed to adult of 282 co-occurring tropical tree and shrub species, including measures of reproduction and accounting for ontogeny. Besides the well-established fast-slow continuum, we identified a second major dimension of demographic variation: a trade-off between recruitment and seedling performance vs. growth and survival of larger individuals (>= 1 cm dbh) corresponding to a 'stature-recruitment' axis. The two demographic dimensions were almost perfectly aligned with two independent trait dimensions (shade tolerance and size). Our results complement recent analyses of plant life-history variation at the global scale and reveal that demographic trade-offs along multiple axes act to structure local communities.

AB Atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition has been found to significantly affect plant growth and physiological performance in terrestrial ecosystems. Many individual studies have investigated how N addition influences plant functional traits, however these investigations have usually been limited to a single species, and thereby do not allow derivation of general patterns or underlying mechanisms. We synthesized data from 56 papers and conducted a meta-analysis to assess the general responses of 15 variables related to leaf economics, gas exchange, and hydraulic traits to N addition among 61 woody plant species, primarily from temperate and subtropical regions. Results showed that under N addition, leaf area index (+10.3%), foliar N content (+7.3%), intrinsic water-use efficiency (+3.1%) and net photosynthetic rate (+16.1%) significantly increased, while specific leaf area, stomatal conductance, and transpiration rate did not change. For plant hydraulics, N addition significantly increased vessel diameter (+7.0%), hydraulic conductance in stems/shoots (+6.7%), and water potential corresponding to 50% loss of hydraulic conductivity (P-50, +21.5%; i.e., P-50 became less negative), while water potential in leaves (-6.7%) decreased (becamemore negative). N addition had little effect on vessel density, hydraulic conductance in leaves and roots, or water potential in stems/shoots. N addition had greater effects on gymnosperms than angiosperms and ammonium nitrate fertilization had larger effects than fertilization with urea, and high levels of N addition affected more traits than low levels. Our results demonstrate that N addition has coupled effects on both carbon and water dynamics of woody plants. Increased leaf N, likely fixed in photosynthetic enzymes and pigments leads to higher photosynthesis and water use efficiency, which may increase leaf growth, as reflected in LAI results. These changes appear to have downstream effects on hydraulic function through increases in vessel diameter, which leads to higher hydraulic conductance, but lower water potential and increased vulnerability to embolism. Overall, our results suggest that N addition will shift plant function along a tradeoff between C and hydraulic economies by enhancing C uptake while simultaneously increasing the risk of hydraulic dysfunction.

AB Plant traits are both responsive to local climate and strong predictors of primary productivity. We hypothesized that future climate change might promote a shift in global plant traits resulting in changes in Gross Primary Productivity (GPP). We characterized the relationship between key plant traits, namely Specific Leaf Area (SLA), height, and seed mass, and local climate and primary productivity. We found that by 2070, tropical and arid ecosystems will be more suitable for plants with relatively lower canopy height, SLA and seed mass, while far northern latitudes will favor woody and taller plants than at present. Using a network of tower eddy covariance CO2 flux measurements and the extrapolated plant trait maps, we estimated the global distribution of annual GPP under current and projected future plant community distribution. We predict that annual GPP in northern biomes (>= 45 degrees N) will increase by 31% (+8.1 +/- 0.5 Pg C), but this will be offset by a 17.9% GPP decline in the tropics (-11.8 +/- 0.84 Pg C). These findings suggest that regional climate changes will affect plant trait distributions, which may in turn affect global productivity patterns.

AB Tropical forests store and sequester large amounts of carbon in above- and below-ground plant biomass and soil organic matter (SOM), but how these are driven by abiotic and biotic factors remains poorly understood.
   Here, we test the effects of abiotic factors (light variation, caused by logging disturbance, and soil fertility) and biotic factors (species richness and functional trait composition) on biomass stocks (above-ground biomass, fine root biomass), SOM and productivity in a relatively monodominant Guyanese tropical rainforest. This forest grows on nutrient-poor soils and has few species that contribute most to total abundance. We, therefore, expected strong effects of soil fertility and species' traits that determine resource acquisition and conservation, but not of diversity. We evaluated 6years of data for 30 0.4-ha plots and tested hypotheses using structural equation models.
   Disturbance increased productivity but decreased above-ground biomass stocks. Soil phosphorus (P) enhanced above-ground biomass and productivity, whereas soil nitrogen reduced fine root biomass. In contrast to expectations, trait values representing acquisitive strategies (e.g. high leaf nutrient concentration) increased biomass stocks, possibly because they indicate higher nutrient absorption and thus higher biomass build-up. However, under harsh conditions where biomass increase is slow, acquisitive trait values may increase respiration and vulnerability to hazards and therefore increase biomass loss. As expected, species richness did not affect productivity.
   We conclude that light availability (through disturbance) and soil fertilityespecially Pstrongly limit forest biomass productivity and stocks in this Guyanese forest. Low P availability may cause strong environmental filtering, which in turn results in a small set of dominant species. As a result, community trait composition but not species richness determines productivity and stocks of biomass and SOM in tropical forest on poor soils.

AB Freshwater ecosystems are impacted by a range of stressors arising from diverse human-caused land and water uses. Identifying the relative importance of single stressors and understanding how multiple stressors interact and jointly affect biology is crucial for River Basin Management.
   This study addressed multiple human-induced stressors and their effects on the aquatic flora and fauna based on data from standard WFD monitoring schemes. For altogether 1095 sites within a mountainous catchment, we used 12 stressor variables covering three different stressor groups: riparian land use, physical habitat quality and nutrient enrichment. Twenty-one biological metrics calculated from taxa lists of three organism groups (fish, benthic invertebrates and aquatic macrophytes) served as response variables. Stressor and response variables were subjected to Boosted Regression Tree (BRT) analysis to identify stressor hierarchy and stressor interactions and subsequently to Generalised Linear Regression Modelling (GLM) to quantify the stressors standardised effect size.
   Our results show that riverine habitat degradation was the dominant stressor group for the river fauna, notably the bed physical habitat structure. Overall, the explained variation in benthic invertebrate metrics was higher than it was in fish and macrophyte metrics. In particular, general integrative (aggregate) metrics such as % Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera (EPT) taxa performed better than ecological traits (e.g. % feeding types). Overall, additive stressor effects dominated, while significant and meaningful stressor interactions were generally rare and weak.
   We concluded that given the type of stressor and ecological response variables addressed in this study, river basin managers do not need to bother much about complex stressor interactions, but can focus on the prevailing stressors according to the hierarchy identified.

AB We analyze scientific literature that report tools to spatially model ecosystem services (ES). In the 65 articles reviewed, the most used model starting in 2001 was SWAT and starting in 2009 the most commonly used was InVEST. Eighty percent of the scientific articles have been published from 2010 to 2015 suggesting that spatial modeling of ES is an emergent research field. Only 4 of the 9 tools encountered in our review are backed by papers, the others only offer grey literature. The spatial modeling of ES is mainly done in the U.S.A. and China, and the most frequently evaluated ES are related to hydrological services (water provision and quality treatment), climate regulation and soil formation. Most of the studies are done along hydrological basins, at different spatial scales and based upon different map resolution ranging from 20 to 900 m. With concern, we observe the lack of validation of the spatial models and the tools' lack of integrated validation modules. As long as the tools used to spatially model ecosystem services continue to be used as black boxes, the models they generate will suffer from a high degree of uncertainty and will not be reliable for decision making purposes.

AB Understanding the mechanism underlying high grain yield and high nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) is very crucial for the development of optimal crop management practices. However, whether and how the canopy eco-physiological characteristics contribute to crop NUE and how they are regulated by crop management practices are unclear. In this study, two high yielding 'super' rice cultivars, Yongyou 2640 and Wuyunjing 24, were grown in the field, and integrated management practices of N rates, planting densities, water management, tillage depth, and organic fertilizer application, were used during the growing season. Results showed that the internal NUE (grain yield/N uptake of plants) is highest in the N blank treatment (0 kg N ha(-1)), and it decreased as the N rate increases. However, at comparable N rates, both rice grain yield and NUE could be improved simultaneously by crop management practices. Canopy N and light profile parameters, i.e. the extinction coefficient for N (K-N) and for light (K-L), and their ratio (K-N/K-L), contributed to yield and NUE. Crop management practices improved canopy eco-physiological characteristics (lower K-L, higher 141 and K-N/K-L) to coordinate the distribution of light and N within the canopy to maximize canopy photosynthesis, and resulted in higher yield and NUE. The physiological mechanisms could be that the increased root activities by management practices contributed to cytokinin synthesis and accumulation in the flag leaves which regulated N partitioning and translocation. The results indicate that canopy eco-physiological traits, especially K-N/K-L ratio is a good indicator of N use efficiency. K-N/K-L is closely correlated with crop yield and NUE, and can be optimized by crop management practices. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Many of the mosquito species responsible for malaria transmission belong to a sibling complex; a taxonomic group of morphologically identical, closely related species. Sibling species often differ in several important factors that have the potential to impact malaria control, including their geographical distribution, resistance to insecticides, biting and resting locations, and host preference. The aim of this study was to define the geographical distributions of dominant malaria vector sibling species in Africa so these distributions can be coupled with data on key factors such as insecticide resistance to aid more focussed, species-selective vector control.
   Results: Within the Anopheles gambiae species complex and the Anopheles funestus subgroup, predicted geographical distributions for Anopheles coluzzii, An. gambiae (as now defined) and An. funestus (distinct from the subgroup) have been produced for the first time. Improved predicted geographical distributions for Anopheles arabiensis, Anopheles melas and Anopheles merus have been generated based on records that were confirmed using molecular identification methods and a model that addresses issues of sampling bias and past changes to the environment. The data available for insecticide resistance has been evaluated and differences between sibling species are apparent although further analysis is required to elucidate trends in resistance.
   Conclusions: Sibling species display important variability in their geographical distributions and the most important malaria vector sibling species in Africa have been mapped here for the first time. This will allow geographical occurrence data to be coupled with species-specific data on important factors for vector control including insecticide resistance. Species-specific data on insecticide resistance is available for the most important malaria vectors in Africa, namely An. arabiensis, An. coluzzii, An. gambiae and An. funestus. Future work to combine these data with the geographical distributions mapped here will allow more focussed and resource-efficient vector control and provide information to greatly improve and inform existing malaria transmission models.

   INTERACTION
AB Invasive and endangered species reflect opposite ends of a spectrum of ecological success, yet they experience many similar eco-evolutionary challenges including demographic bottlenecks, hybridization and novel environments. Despite these similarities, important differences exist. Demographic bottlenecks are more transient in invasive species, which (i) maintains ecologically relevant genetic variation, (ii) reduces mutation load, and (iii) increases the efficiency of natural selection relative to genetic drift. Endangered species are less likely to benefit from admixture, which offsets mutation load but also reduces fitness when populations are locally adapted. Invading species generally experience more benign environments with fewer natural enemies, which increases fitness directly and also indirectly by masking inbreeding depression. Adaptive phenotypic plasticity can maintain fitness in novel environments but is more likely to evolve in invasive species encountering variable habitats and to be compromised by demographic factors in endangered species. Placed in an eco-evolutionary context, these differences affect the breadth of the ecological niche, which arises as an emergent property of antagonistic selection and genetic constraints. Comparative studies of invasions and extinctions that apply an eco-evolutionary perspective could provide new insights into the environmental and genetic basis of ecological success in novel environments and improve efforts to preserve global biodiversity.

AB Animal behaviour can provide valuable information for wildlife management and conservation. Studying the detailed behaviour of marine mammals involves challenges not faced by most animal behaviour researchers due to the size, mobility and lack of continuous visibility of these animals. We describe several methods developed by marine mammal scientists to study behaviour, primarily of cetaceans, focusing on technological advances: unmanned aerial systems (UAS), satellite-linked telemetry, passive acoustics and multisensor high-resolution acoustic recording tags. We then go on to explain how the data collected by these methods have contributed to and informed conservation actions. We focus on examples including: satellite data informing the interactions between cetaceans and offshore oil and gas development; passive acoustics used to track distributions of several species of cetaceans, including their movements near shipping lanes; and high-resolution acoustic recording tags used to document responses of cetaceans to anthropogenic activities. Finally, we discuss recent efforts to link animal behaviour to individual fitness and, particularly for behavioural disturbances, to population-level consequences, which can be helpful for informing conservation efforts. The infusion of technological advancements into studies of cetacean behaviour combined with emerging analytical techniques brings us to the next 20+ years of studying these animals. These developments will improve our capabilities in areas such as testing whether their behaviour adheres to traditional behavioural theory, and will certainly assist the guiding of conservation efforts.

AB Drought- and heat-driven tree mortality, along with associated insect outbreaks, have been observed globally in recent decades and are expected to increase in future climates. Despite its potential to profoundly alter ecosystem carbon and water cycles, how tree mortality scales up to ecosystem functions and fluxes is uncertain. We describe a framework for this scaling where the effects of mortality are a function of the mortality attributes, such as spatial clustering and functional role of the trees killed, and ecosystem properties, such as productivity and diversity. We draw upon remote-sensing data and ecosystem flux data to illustrate this framework and place climate-driven tree mortality in the context of other major disturbances. We find that emerging evidence suggests that climate-driven tree mortality impacts may be relatively small and recovery times are remarkably fast (similar to 4 years for net ecosystem production). We review the key processes in ecosystem models necessary to simulate the effects of mortality on ecosystem fluxes and highlight key research gaps in modeling. Overall, our results highlight the key axes of variation needed for better monitoring and modeling of the impacts of tree mortality and provide a foundation for including climate-driven tree mortality in a disturbance framework.

AB Understanding how animal groups respond to contemporary habitat loss and fragmentation is essential for development of strategies for species conservation. Until now, there has been no consensus about how landscape degradation affects the diversity and distribution of Neotropical bats. Some studies demonstrate population declines and species loss in impacted areas, although the magnitude and generality of these effects on bat community structure are unclear. Empirical fragmentation thresholds predict an accentuated drop in biodiversity, and species richness in particular, when less than 30% of the original amount of habitat in the landscape remains. In this study, we tested whether bat species richness demonstrates this threshold response, based on 48 sites distributed across 12 landscapes with 9-88% remaining forest in Brazilian cerrado-forest formations. We also examined the degree to which abundance was similarly affected within four different feeding guilds. The threshold value for richness, below which bat diversity declines precipitously, was estimated at 47% of remaining forest. To verify if the response of bat abundance to habitat loss differed among feeding guilds, we used a model selection approach based on Akaike's information criterion. Models accounted for the amount of riparian forest, semideciduous forest, cerrado, tree plantations, secondary forest, and the total amount of forest in the landscape. We demonstrate a nonlinear effect of the contribution of tree plantations to frugivores, and a positive effect of the amount of cerrado to nectarivores and animalivores, the groups that responded most to decreases in amount of forest. We suggest that bat assemblages in interior Atlantic Forest and cerrado regions of southeastern Brazil are impoverished, since we found lower richness and abundance of different groups in landscapes with lower amounts of forest. The relatively higher threshold value of 47% suggests that bat communities have a relatively lower resistance to habitat degradation than other animal groups. Accordingly, conservation and restoration strategies should focus on increasing the amount of native vegetation of landscapes so as to enhance species richness of bats.

AB Clearance for agriculture or cattle ranching was the dominant land-cover change during the last two decades in the South American Dry Chaco. The Argentinean portion has been particularly affected, presenting greater deforestation rates than the continental and global averages. Little is known on the control factors of the location and the spatial clearance patterns. In this article we studied (a) deforestation dynamics in the Argentinean Dry Chaco and the factors determining land clearing locations for the last 25 years; (b) changes in the relative impact of those factors through time and space; and (c) the effect of regulations aimed to control the location and magnitude of land transformation. We also tested the "expansion of the agricultural frontier" hypothesis for the Argentinean Chaco. To identify the factors that defined agricultural expansion we used binomial logistic models that were fitted to a set of independent variables (bio-physical, infrastructure and political factors) that could eventually influence the distribution of new agricultural areas. Results indicate that the Forest Law devised by the Argentinean federal government to control the clearing process was insufficient to restrict both the area transformed per year and clearance locations. Agriculture is expanding over marginal areas and land clearing dynamics have been increasingly associated to the proximity to already cleared areas, defining a frontier advancement pattern which gives the idea of a contagion process. According to our results, the relative importance of the anthropic factors associated to the agricultural expansion in the region increased through time. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Context Understanding how urban impervious surfaces (UIS) affect land surface temperatures (LST) on different scales in space and time is important for urban ecology and sustainability.
   Objectives We examined how spatial scales, seasonal and diurnal variations, and bioclimatic settings affected the UIS-LST relationship in mainland China.
   Methods We took a hierarchical approach explicitly considering three scales: the ecoregion, urban cluster, and urban core. The UIS-LST relationship was quantified with Pearson correlation using multiple remote sensing datasets.
   Results In general, UIS and LST were positively correlated in summer daytime/nighttime and winter nighttime, but negatively in winter daytime. The strength of correlation increased from broad to fine scales. The mean R-2 of winter nights at the urban core scale (0.262) was 4.03 times as high as that at the ecoregion scale (0.065). The relationship showed large seasonal and diurnal variations: generally stronger in summer than in winter and stronger in nighttime than in daytime. At the urban core scale, the mean R-2 of summer daytime (0.208) was 3.25 times as high as that of winter daytime (0.064), and the mean R-2 of winter nighttime (0.262) was 4.10 times as high as that of winter daytime (0.064). Vegetation and climate substantially modified the relationship during summer daytime on the ecoregion scale.
   Conclusions Our study provides new evidence that the UIS-LST relationship varies with spatial scales, diurnal/seasonal cycles, and bioclimatic context, with new insight into the cross-scale properties of the relationship. These findings have implications for mitigating urban heat island effects across scales in China and beyond.

AB Pulsatilla patens s.s. is a one of the most endangered plant species in Europe. The present range of this species in Europe is highly fragmented and the size of the populations has been dramatically reduced in the past 50 years. The rapid disappearance of P. patens localities in Europe has prompted the European Commission to initiate active protection of this critically endangered species. The aim of this study was to estimate the degree and distribution of genetic diversity within European populations of this endangered species. We screened 29 populations of P. patens using a set of six microsatellite primers. The results of our study indicate that the analyzed populations are characterized by low levels of genetic diversity (H-o = 0.005) and very high levels of inbreeding (F-IS = 0.90). These results suggest that genetic erosion could be partially responsible for the lower fitness in smaller populations of this species. Private allelic richness was very low, being as low as 0.00 for most populations. Average genetic diversity over loci and mean number of alleles in P. patens populations were significantly correlated with population size, suggesting severe genetic drift. The results of AMOVA point to higher levels of variation within populations than between populations. The results of Structure and PCoA analyses suggest that the genetic structure of the studied P. patens populations fall into three clusters corresponding to geographical regions. The most isolated populations (mostly from Romania) formed a separate group with a homogeneous gene pool located at the southern, steppic part of the distribution range. Baltic, mostly Polish, populations fall into two genetic groups which were not fully compatible with their geographic distribution. Our results indicate the serious genetic depauperation of P. patens in the western part of its range, even hinting at an ongoing extinction vortex. Therefore, special conservation attention is required to maintain the populations of this highly endangered species of European Community interest.

AB The importance of waterbirds as vectors of aliens has been recognized since Darwin's time, yet research by pioneers has been forgotten during the development of modern invasion biology, which tends to overlook this means of dispersal. Waterbirds are ignored in databases of alien species and invasion pathways, making management and prevention of invasions more difficult. I summarize 22 studies that provide empirical evidence for the dispersal of alien plants and invertebrates by waterbirds in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, complementing 14 studies recently identified by Reynolds et al. (2015, Diversity and Distributions, 21, 744-754). Together, these studies provide empirical evidence for the dispersal of 79 alien plant species and eight alien invertebrates by waterbirds, including some of the worst aquatic invaders and the most widely distributed alien terrestrial plant species. Waterbirds known to be vectors include ducks, geese, swans, shorebirds, gulls, herons and rails. Aliens are usually dispersed after being ingested or becoming attached to plumage, bills or feet, but waterbirds also disperse alien species when making nests, when preying on other vectors such as fish, or even attached to leg rings. Whilst waterbirds may have a trivial role in explaining the arrival of alien species to new continents, they have a vital role in spreading aliens around once they get there. Greater focus on the role of waterbird vectors is essential if management of invasions is to be effective, and I make proposals for future research.

AB We asked two research questions: (1) What are the relative effects of climate change and climate-driven vegetation shifts on different components of future fire regimes? (2) How does incorporating climate-driven vegetation change into future fire regime projections alter the results compared to projections based only on direct climate effects? We used the western United States (US) as study area to answer these questions. Future (2071-2100) fire regimes were projected using statistical models to predict spatial patterns of occurrence, size and spread for large fires (>400 ha) and a simulation experiment was conducted to compare the direct climatic effects and the indirect effects of climate-driven vegetation change on fire regimes. Results showed that vegetation change amplified climate-driven increases in fire frequency and size and had a larger overall effect on future total burned area in the western US than direct climate effects. Vegetation shifts, which were highly sensitive to precipitation pattern changes, were also a strong determinant of the future spatial pattern of burn rates and had different effects on fire in currently forested and grass/shrub areas. Our results showed that climate-driven vegetation change can exert strong localized effects on fire occurrence and size, which in turn drive regional changes in fire regimes. The effects of vegetation change for projections of the geographic patterns of future fire regimes may be at least as important as the direct effects of climate change, emphasizing that accounting for changing vegetation patterns in models of future climate-fire relationships is necessary to provide accurate projections at continental to global scales.

AB Existing data sets on earthworm communities in Europe were collected, harmonized, collated, modelled and depicted on a soil biodiversity map. Digital Soil Mapping was applied using multiple regressions relating relatively low density earthworm community data to soil characteristics, land use, vegetation and climate factors (covariables) with a greater spatial resolution. Statistically significant relationships were used to build habitat-response models for maps depicting earthworm abundance and species diversity. While a good number of environmental predictors were significant in multiple regressions, geographical factors alone seem to be less relevant than climatic factors. Despite differing sampling protocols across the investigated European countries, land use and geological history were the most relevant factors determining the demography and diversity of the earthworms. Case studies from country-specific data sets (France, Germany, Ireland and The Netherlands) demonstrated the importance and efficiency of large databases for the detection of large spatial patterns that could be subsequently applied at smaller (local) scales.

AB Current efforts to restore and create ecosystems require greater understanding of ecosystems' responses to commonly used physical and biological intervention approaches to overcome ecological and technological limitations. We estimated effect sizes from measurements of biotic assemblage structure and biogeochemical functions at 628 restored and created wetlands globally, in comparison with 499 reference wetlands. We studied the recovery trajectories of wetlands where different restoration or creation approaches were used under different environmental settings. Although the variance explained by a linear mixed-effects models was low (6-7%), the study of recovery trajectories showed that the restoration or creation approach had no significant effects in most environmental settings. In particular, wetlands where surface modification and flow re-establishment were used followed similar recovery trajectories regardless of whether they were revegetated or not. We even found potential detrimental effects of biological manipulations on the recovery of the plant assemblage, particularly in cold climates and in wetlands restored or created in agricultural areas. Since physical interventions are required to recover or create the hydrological conditions of degraded or new wetlands, and given the high cost (22-73%) of biological interventions (i.e. revegetation), the need for biological interventions is, in most cases, unclear. Our results highlight the urgent need to increase our understanding of the long-term effects of restoration and creation actions in our aim to engage in large-scale ecosystem management strategies for wetlands.Synthesis and applications. These results suggest that, currently, the recovery and development processes of restored and created wetlands can be driven by spontaneous processes rather than by the response of wetlands to human interventions other than those targeted to restore hydrological conditions that existed prior to disturbance. However, given the synthetic nature of the data set, the mixed nature of available data and the limited number of measures we found to estimate recovery, caution must be exercised when adapting the results presented here to the planning and execution of specific ecosystem restoration projects.

AB The European purple sea urchin (Paracentrotus lividus) is considered to be a key herbivore throughout its distribution range-North-East Atlantic and Mediterranean Sea. It was also abundant in its eastern distributional edge, on rocky habitats of the coastline of Israel, but its populations have recently collapsed, and today it is an extremely rare species in the region. Field and laboratory experiments, that were carried out in order to examine the impact of the recent sea surface temperature rise in the Eastern Mediterranean, showed massive urchin mortality when temperatures crossed 30.5 degrees C before reaching peak summer values. These results suggest that elevated seawater temperatures in recent years may be a main cause for the disappearance of P. lividus from the southeast Mediterranean Sea, which may indicate distributional range contraction in this region.

It is a zoonotic disease, with the Egyptian rousette (Rousettus aegyptiacus) identified as a reservoir host. Infection is suspected to result from contact between this reservoir and human populations, with occasional secondary human-to-human transmission.
   Methods: Index cases of previous human outbreaks were identified and reports of infection in animals recorded. These data were modelled within a species distribution modelling framework in order to generate a probabilistic surface of zoonotic transmission potential of MVD across sub-Saharan Africa.
   Results: Areas suitable for zoonotic transmission of MVD are predicted in 27 countries inhabited by 105 million people. Regions are suggested for exploratory surveys to better characterise the geographical distribution of the disease, as well as for directing efforts to communicate the risk of practices enhancing zoonotic contact.
   Conclusions: These maps can inform future contingency and preparedness strategies for MVD control, especially where secondary transmission is a risk. Coupling this risk map with patient travel histories could be used to guide the differential diagnosis of highly transmissible pathogens, enabling more rapid response to outbreaks of haemorrhagic fever.

AB The development of genetic markers has revolutionized molecular studies within and among populations. Although poly-allelic microsatellites are the most commonly used genetic marker for within-population studies of free-living animals, biallelic single nucleotide polymorphisms, or SNPs, have also emerged as a viable option for use in nonmodel systems. We describe a robust method of SNP discovery from the transcriptome of a nonmodel organism that resulted in more than 99% of the markers working successfully during genotyping. We then compare the use of 102 novel SNPs with 15 previously developed microsatellites for studies of parentage and kinship in cooperatively breeding superb starlings (Lamprotornis superbus) that live in highly kin-structured groups. For 95% of the offspring surveyed, SNPs and microsatellites identified the same genetic father, but only when behavioural information about the likely parents at a nest was included to aid in assignment. Moreover, when such behavioural information was available, the number of SNPs necessary for successful parentage assignment was reduced by half. However, in a few cases where candidate fathers were highly related, SNPs did a better job at assigning fathers than microsatellites. Despite high variation between individual pairwise relatedness values, microsatellites and SNPs performed equally well in kinship analyses. This study is the first to compare SNPs and microsatellites for analyses of parentage and relatedness in a species that lives in groups with a complex social and kin structure. It should also prove informative for those interested in developing SNP loci from transcriptome data when published genomes are unavailable.

AB The climatic conditions of mountain habitats are greatly influenced by topography. Large differences in microclimate occur with small changes in elevation, and this complex interaction is an important determinant of mountain plant distributions. In spite of this, elevation is not often considered as a relevant predictor in species distribution models (SDMs) for mountain plants. Here, we evaluated the importance of including elevation as a predictor in SDMs for mountain plant species. We generated two sets of SDMs for each of 73 plant species that occur in the Pacific Northwest of North America; one set of models included elevation as a predictor variable and the other set did not. AUC scores indicated that omitting elevation as a predictor resulted in a negligible reduction of model performance. However, further analysis revealed that the omission of elevation resulted in large over-predictions of species' niche breadths this effect was most pronounced for species that occupy the highest elevations. In addition, the inclusion of elevation as a predictor constrained the effects of other predictors that superficially affected the outcome of the models generated without elevation. Our results demonstrate that the inclusion of elevation as a predictor variable improves the quality of SDMs for high-elevation plant species. Because of the negligible AUC score penalty for over-predicting niche breadth, our results support the notion that AUC scores alone should not be used as a measure of model quality. More generally, our results illustrate the importance of selecting biologically relevant predictor variables when constructing SDMs. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB There are growing demands for detailed and accurate land cover maps in land system research and planning. Macro-scale land cover maps normally cannot satisfy the studies that require detailed land cover maps at micro scales. In the meantime, applying conventional pixel-based classification methods in classifying high-resolution aerial imagery is ineffective to develop high accuracy land-cover maps, especially in spectrally heterogeneous and complicated urban areas. Here we present an object-based approach that identifies land-cover types from 1-meter resolution aerial orthophotography and a 5-foot DEM. Our study area is Tippecanoe County in the State of Indiana, USA, which covers about a 1300 km(2) land area. We used a countywide aerial photo mosaic and normalized digital elevation model as input datasets in this study. We utilized simple algorithms to minimize computation time while maintaining relatively high accuracy in land cover mapping at a county scale. The aerial photograph was pre-processed using principal component transformation to reduce its spectral dimensionality. Vegetation and non-vegetation were separated via masks determined by the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index. A combination of segmentation algorithms with lower calculation intensity was used to generate image objects that fulfill the characteristics selection requirements. A hierarchical image object network was formed based on the segmentation results and used to assist the image object delineation at different spatial scales. Finally, expert knowledge regarding spectral, contextual, and geometrical aspects was employed in image object identification. The resultant land cover map developed with this object-based image analysis has more information classes and higher accuracy than that derived with pixel-based classification methods.

AB In many cities worldwide, urbanization is leading to the rapid and extensive fragmentation of native vegetation into small and scattered urban remnants. We investigated the effects of fragmentation on plant species richness and abundance in 30 remnant Banksia woodlands in the rapidly expanding city of Perth, located in the southwestern Australian global biodiversity hotspot. We considered a comprehensive set of factors characterizing landscape fragmentation dynamics (current and historical remnant area and connectivity, time since isolation, and trajectories of landscape change), disturbance regimes (fire frequency, grazing, and intensity of human activities), and local environmental conditions (soil nutrient status and litter depth). We used generalized linear mixed models to determine the interactive effects of time since remnant isolation and remnant area on plant species richness, and structural equation models to disentangle the direct and indirect effects of landscape and local factors on plant species richness and abundance. Fragmentation impacts were most rapid in smaller remnants. Indeed, in the small remnants, native plant species richness was halved in only a few decades after isolation, suggesting an underlying rapid loss of habitat quality. We found that richness and abundance of woody species were higher in historically large remnants and lower in the rural areas, despite these rural remnants showing greater connectivity. Richness of native herbaceous species declined with time since isolation, mainly in the smaller remnants, and this was associated with altered soil properties. Furthermore, increased litter depth (possibly indicating higher productivity) and increased abundance of nonnative herbaceous species in the older and smaller remnants was associated with a decline in the abundance of native herbaceous species. Our study suggests that in rapidly expanding cities, landscape fragmentation can have major and complex effects on remnant vegetation. Yet these impacts might take several decades to manifest themselves. Hence, understanding the long-term conservation capacity of newly formed remnants, which is key to setting conservation priorities, requires consideration of landscape fragmentation and land use history. Moreover, the smaller and older remnants may already display changes due to fragmentation, providing clues for urban planning and ecosystem management that help to protect urban remnant plant diversity.

AB Landscape and site-scale data analyses aid the interpretation of biological data and thereby help us develop more cost-effective natural resource management strategies. Our study focused on environmental influences on stream assemblages and we evaluated how three classes of environmental variables (geophysical landscape, land use and cover, and site habitat), influence fish and macroinvertebrate assemblage richness in the Brazilian Cerrado biome. We analyzed our data through use of multiple linear regression (MLR) models using the three classes of predictor variables alone and in combination. The four MLR models explained dissimilar amounts of benthic macroinvertebrate taxa richness (geophysical landscape R (2) a parts per thousand 35 %, land use and cover R (2) a parts per thousand 28 %, site habitat R (2) a parts per thousand 36 %, and combined R (2) a parts per thousand 51 %). For fish assemblages, geophysical landscape, land use and cover, site habitat, and combined models explained R (2) a parts per thousand 28 %, R (2) a parts per thousand 10 %, R (2) a parts per thousand 31 %, and R (2) a parts per thousand 47 % of the variability in fish species richness, respectively. We conclude that (1) environmental variables differed in the degree to which they explain assemblage richness, (2) the amounts of variance in assemblage richness explained by geophysical landscape and site habitat were similar, (3) the variables explained more variability in macroinvertebrate taxa richness than in fish species richness, and (4) all three classes of environmental variables studied were useful for explaining assemblage richness in Cerrado headwater streams. These results help us to understand the drivers of assemblage patterns at regional scales in tropical areas.

AB Although most conservationists claim to protect "species", the conservation unit actually and practically managed is the individual population. As resources are not unlimited, we need to focus on a restricted number of populations. But how can we select them? The Evolutionarily Significant Unit (ESU), first conceptualised by Ryder in 1986, may offer some answer. Several definitions have been proposed for the ESU, but all make reference to units "whose divergence can be measured or evaluated by putting differential emphasis on the role of evolutionary forces at varied temporal scales". Thus, an ESU might be fully identical with a "species", or a "species" could be composed of multiple ESUs. On the other hand, an ESU might comprise single/multiple populations exchanging a degree of gene flow, such as meta-populations. In an attempt to show strengths and weaknesses of ESU concepts, we present here, among several others, some case studies on the myrmecophilous butterflies of the genus Maculinea. In particular, we analyse the apparently everlasting debate about Maculinea alcon and M. rebeli, whose separation into separate species has been accepted by many authors, on mainly ecological criteria, but has not been fully supported by molecular analyses. We also discuss how the tight association with host ants may have driven selection for increasingly more strictly adapted Maculinea populations, arguably deserving specific taxonomic identity. Finally we discuss how current DNA analyses may fail to detect critical information on differences between taxa recently originated by the action of separate adaptive processes, which non-molecular studies can sometimes reveal. We conclude by discussing some current and often conflicting taxonomic trends, in their relationships with conservation policies.

AB Roads can fragment and isolate wildlife populations, which will eventually decrease genetic diversity within populations. Wildlife crossing structures may counteract these impacts, but most crossings are relatively new, and there is little evidence that they facilitate gene flow. We conducted a three-year research project in Banff National Park, Alberta, to evaluate the effectiveness of wildlife crossings to provide genetic connectivity. Our main objective was to determine how the Trans-Canada Highway and crossing structures along it affect gene flow in grizzly (Ursus arctos) and black bears (Ursus americanus). We compared genetic data generated from wildlife crossings with data collected from greater bear populations. We detected a genetic discontinuity at the highway in grizzly bears but not in black bears. We assigned grizzly bears that used crossings to populations north and south of the highway, providing evidence of bidirectional gene flow and genetic admixture. Parentage tests showed that 47% of black bears and 27% of grizzly bears that used crossings successfully bred, including multiple males and females of both species. Differentiating between dispersal and gene flow is difficult, but we documented gene flow by showing migration, reproduction and genetic admixture. We conclude that wildlife crossings allow sufficient gene flow to prevent genetic isolation.

AB The ability to accurately model and predict the ambient concentration of Particulate Matter (PM) is essential for effective air quality management and policies development. Various statistical approaches exist for modelling air pollutant levels. In this paper, several approaches including linear, non-linear, and machine learning methods are evaluated for the prediction of urban PM10 concentrations in the City of Makkah, Saudi Arabia. The models employed are Multiple Linear Regression Model (MLRM), Quantile Regression Model (QRM), Generalised Additive Model (GAM), and Boosted Regression Trees1-way (BRT1) and 2-way (BRT2). Several meteorological parameters and chemical species measured during 2012 are used as covariates in the models. Various statistical metrics, including the Mean Bias Error (MBE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), the fraction of prediction within a Factor of Two (FACT2), correlation coefficient (R), and Index of Agreement (IA) are calculated to compare the predictive performance of the models. Results show that both MLRM and QRM captured the mean PM10 levels. However, QRM topped the other models in capturing the variations in PM10 concentrations. Based on the values of error indices, QRM showed better performance in predicting hourly PM10 concentrations. Superiority over the other models is explained by the ability of QRM to model the contribution of covariates at different quantiles of the modelled variable (here PM10). In this way QRM provides a better approximation procedure compared to the other modelling approaches, which consider a single central tendency response to a set of independent variables. Numerous recent studies have used these modelling approaches, however this is the first study that compares their performance for predicting PM10 concentrations.

TI Planning Pacific Salmon and Steelhead Reintroductions Aimed at Long-Term

AB Local extirpations of Pacific salmon Oncorhynchus spp. and steelhead O. mykiss, often due to dams and other stream barriers, are common throughout the western United States. Reestablishing salmonid populations in areas they historically occupied has substantial potential to assist conservation efforts, but best practices for reintroduction are not well established. In this paper, we present a framework for planning reintroductions designed to promote the recovery of salmonids listed under the Endangered Species Act. Before implementing a plan, managers should first describe the benefits, risks, and constraints of a proposed reintroduction. We define benefits as specific biological improvements towards recovery objectives. Risks are the potential negative outcomes of reintroductions that could worsen conservation status rather than improve it. Constraints are biological factors that will determine whether the reintroduction successfully establishes a self-sustaining population. We provide guidance for selecting a recolonization strategy (natural colonization, transplanting, or hatchery releases), a source population, and a method for providing passage that will maximize the probability of conservation benefit while minimizing risks. Monitoring is necessary to determine whether the reintroduction successfully achieved the benefits and to evaluate the impacts on nontarget species or populations. Many of the benefits, especially diversity and the evolution of locally adapted population segments, are likely to accrue over decadal time scales. Thus, we view reintroduction as a long-term approach to enhancing viability. Finally, our review of published salmonid reintroduction case studies suggests that large uncertainties remain in the success of reintroduction in establishing self-sustaining populations, particularly for programs employing active methods.

AB We studied summer mesozooplankton composition between 2001 and 2009, in the epipelagic zone of the West Spitsbergen Current (WSC) and adjacent areas, which constitute a transition zone between warmer Atlantic and cold Arctic waters. According to hydrography and species composition, this region could be divided into 4 main areas: western and eastern branches of the WSC, the Greenland Sea together with Fram Strait, and the shelf areas of Spitsbergen and the Barents Sea. The most abundant species was Oithona similis and the most important, in terms of biomass, was Calanus finmarchicus; both species were found at all stations. The novel spatial analysis method of principal coordinates of neighbour matrices (PCNM) and the following variation partitioning were applied to disentangle the contributions of environmental variables and spatial differences in explaining mesozooplankton community variation. In spite of the large geographic area covered, environmental factors used in redundancy analysis (RDA) explained 30.6% of zooplankton variability, while the spatial distribution of sampling stations was responsible for 27.2%, and 12.5% was a common share of both predictors, coming from their correlations. We observed a smooth change from dominance of ubiquitous and boreo-Arctic taxa such as O. similis and Triconia sp. in the beginning of the study period towards stronger dominance of boreal taxa such as C. finmarchicus, which was the most abundant species in 2009.

AB Environmental conditions and plant size may both alter the outcome of inter-specific plant-plant interactions, with seedlings generally facilitated more strongly than larger individuals in stressful habitats. However, the combined impact of plant size and environmental severity on interactions is poorly understood.
   Here, we tested explicitly for the first time the hypothesis that ontogenetic shifts in interactions are delayed under increasingly severe conditions by examining the interaction between a grass, Agrostis magellanica, and a cushion plant, Azorella selago, along two severity gradients.
   The impact of A. selago on A. magellanica abundance, but not reproductive effort, was related to A. magellanica size, with a trend for delayed shifts towards more negative interactions under greater environmental severity. Intermediate-sized individuals were most strongly facilitated, leading to differences in the size-class distribution of A. magellanica on the soil and on A. selago. The A. magellanica size-class distribution was more strongly affected by A. selago than by environmental severity, demonstrating that the plant-plant interaction impacts A. magellanica population structure more strongly than habitat conditions.
   As ontogenetic shifts in plant-plant interactions cannot be assumed to be constant across severity gradients and may impact species population structure, studies examining the outcome of interactions need to consider the potential for size-or age-related variation in competition and facilitation.

AB Aim Species inhabiting fresh waters are severely affected by climate change and other anthropogenic stressors. Effective management and conservation plans require advances in the accuracy and reliability of species distribution forecasts. Here, we forecast distribution shifts of Salmo trutta based on environmental predictors and examine the effect of using different statistical techniques and varying geographical extents on the performance and extrapolation of the models obtained.
   Location Watercourses of Ebro, Elbe and Danube river basins (c. 1,041,000 km(2); Mediterranean and temperate climates, Europe).
   Methods The occurrence of S. trutta and variables of climate, land cover and stream topography were assigned to stream reaches. Data obtained were used to build correlative species distribution models (SDMs) and forecasts for future decades (2020s, 2050s and 2080s) under the A1b emissions scenario, using four statistical techniques (generalised linear models, generalised additive models, random forest, and multivariate adaptive regression).
   Results The SDMs showed an excellent performance. Climate was a better predictor than stream topography, while land cover characteristics were not necessary to improve performance. Forecasts predict the distribution of S. trutta to become increasingly restricted over time. The geographical extent of data had a weak impact on model performance and gain/loss values, but better species response curves were generated using data from all three basins collectively. By 2080, 64% of the stream reaches sampled will be unsuitable habitats for S. trutta, with Elbe basin being the most affected, and virtually no new habitats will be gained in any basin.
   Main conclusions More reliable predictions are obtained when the geographical data used for modelling approximate the environmental range where the species is present. Future research incorporating both correlative and mechanistic approaches may increase robustness and accuracy of predictions.

AB Severe impacts on biodiversity are predicted to arise from climate change. These impacts may not be adequately addressed by conventional approaches to conservation. As a result, additional management actions are now being considered. However, there is currently limited guidance to help decision makers choose which set of actions (and in what order) is most appropriate for species that are considered to be vulnerable. Here, we provide a decision framework for the full complement of actions aimed at conserving species under climate change from ongoing conservation in existing refugia through various forms of mobility enhancement to ex situ conservation outside the natural environment. We explicitly recognize that allocation of conservation resources toward particular actions may be governed by factors such as the likelihood of success, cost and likely co-benefits to non-target species in addition to perceived vulnerability of individual species. As such, we use expert judgment of probable tradeoffs in resource allocation to inform the sequential evaluation of proposed management interventions.

AB Premise of the study: The global distribution of mangroves is attributed to interactions between long-distance propagule dispersal and geographical barriers, which are manifest in genetic structuring. Uncovering this genetic structure thus provides a window into the ecological, evolutionary, and phylogeographic history of mangroves. We used cpDNA and nuclear microsatellites to evaluate transbarrier (transoceanic and transisthmian) linkages in the genus Rhizophora in the Atlantic East Pacific (AEP) and South Pacific region.
   Methods: Leaf samples of 756 individuals of Rhizophora mangle, R. racemosa, R. xharrisonii, and R. samoensis from 36 populations across the AEP supplied material from which we used the cpDNA haplotypes and nine microsatellite markers for population analyses.
   Key results: Clear genetic differentiation of cpDNA haplotypes was found between the Pacific and Atlantic populations in R. mangle and R. racemosa, supporting the hypothesis of the Central American Isthmus as a barrier to gene flow. Both cpDNA and microsatellite analyses support the hypothesis of recent and frequent transatlantic propagule dispersal for R. mangle. Finally, we provide strong evidence for genetic similarity of Pacific R. mangle and R. samoensis suggesting trans-Pacific dispersal of R. mangle.
   Conclusion: The American continents are strong geographical barriers to dispersal of Rhizophora, to the point where the Pacific and Atlantic populations are distinct genealogical units, supporting the recommendation to treat the populations as separate conservation and management units. Trans-Pacific propagule dispersal of Rhizophora has occurred; R. mangle and R. samoensis might be the same species and this question should be resolved with further taxonomic study.

AB Estimates of effective population size are critical for species of conservation concern. Genetic datasets can be used to provide robust estimates of this important parameter. However, the methods used to obtain these estimates assume that generations are discrete. We used simulated data to assess the influences of overlapping generations on the estimates of effective size provided by the linkage disequilibrium (LD) method. Our simulations focus on two factors: the degree of reproductive skew exhibited by the focal species and the generation time, without considering sample size or the level of polymorphism at marker loci. In situations where a majority of reproduction is achieved by a small fraction of the population, the effective number of breeders can be much smaller than the per-generation effective population size. The LD in samples of newborns can provide estimates of the former size, while our results indicate that the latter size is best estimated using random samples of reproductively mature adults. Using samples of adults, the downwards bias was less than approximately 15% across our simulated life histories. As noted in previous assessments, precision of the estimate depends on the magnitude of effective size itself, with greater precision achieved for small populations.

AB The red palm weevil (RPW), Rhynchophorus ferrugineus (Olivier) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), ranks among the most important pests of various palm species. The pest originates from South and Southeast Asia, but has expanded its range dramatically since the 1980s. We used ecological niche modeling (ENM) approaches to explore its likely geographic potential. Two techniques, the Genetic Algorithm for Rule-set Prediction (GARP) and a maximum entropy approach (MaxEnt), were used. However, MaxEnt provided more significant results, with all 5 random replicate subsamples having P < 0.002 while GARP models failed to achieve statistical significance in 3 of 5 cases, in which predictions achieved probabilities of 0.07 < P < 0.10. The MaxEnt models predicted successfully the known distribution, including the single North American occurrence point of Laguna Beach, California, and various areas where the pest has been reported in North Africa, southern Europe, Middle East and South and Southeastern Asia. In addition, areas where the pest has not been yet reported were found to be suitable for invasion by RPW in sub-Saharan Africa, southern, central and northern America, Asia, Europe, and Oceania. Highly suitable areas in the United States of America were limited mostly to coastal California and southern Florida, while all Caribbean islands were found highly suitable for establishment and spread of the pest.

AB Non-native species have reached South American ecosystems and may be threatening the exceptional biodiversity of this region. However, people often value and exploit introduced species not knowing that they are non-natives, nor understanding their impacts. In this paper we analyze the trend of scientific research on introduced species in South America and whether a socio-cultural explanation could underlie the results by comparing them with European, North American and Australasian countries. We also controlled for research effort, which could reflect economic inequalities, by analyzing the articles published on introduced species in relation to the total number of articles published on related disciplines. Research trends suggest that non-native species are not of major concern for South American countries, there being less research on this topic in countries with higher biodiversity. Compared to other colonized countries such as the USA, New Zealand and Australia, research on non-native species was lagging and less abundant in South America, even when controlling for research effort. Historical and recent socio-cultural particularities may explain the similar attitudes and research input seen in South American countries and their Spanish and Portuguese colonizers. A generational amnesia, where younger generations descendent from European colonizers are not aware of past biological conditions, could be exacerbating this lack of concern. South American policies seem to reflect the low level of interest in non-native species shown by their citizens. National policies are poorly developed and mainly deal with alien species threatening productive systems. Given the strong cultural component of this dilemma, integrated ways to reverse this situation are needed, including education, international research collaboration, and a common South American policy.

AB Evolutionary rate covariation (ERC) is a phylogenetic signature that reflects the covariation of a pair of proteins over evolutionary time. ERC is typically elevated between interacting proteins and so is a promising signature to characterize molecular and functional interactions across the genome. ERC is often assumed to result from compensatory changes at interaction interfaces (i.e., intermolecular coevolution); however, its origin is still unclear and is likely to be complex. Here, we determine the biological factors responsible for ERC in a proteome-wide data set of 4459 proteins in 18 budding yeast species. We show that direct physical interaction is not required to produce ERC, because we observe strong correlations between noninteracting but cofunctional enzymes. We also demonstrate that ERC is uniformly distributed along the protein primary sequence, suggesting that intermolecular coevolution is not generally responsible for ERC between physically interacting proteins. Using multivariate analysis, we show that a pair of proteins is likely to exhibit ERC if they share a biological function or if their expression levels coevolve between species. Thus, ERC indicates shared function and coexpression of protein pairs and not necessarily coevolution between sites, as has been assumed in previous studies. This full interpretation of ERC now provides us with a powerful tool to assign uncharacterized proteins to functional groups and to determine the interconnectedness between entire genetic pathways.

AB Climate models indicate that global warming will stimulate atmospheric exchange processes and increase rainfall variability, leading to longer dry periods and more intense rainfall events. Recent studies suggest that both the magnitude of the rainfall events and their frequency may be as important for temperate grassland productivity as the annual sum. However, until now interactive effects between land management practice, such as mowing frequency, and rainfall variability on productivity and forage quality have not been studied in detail. Here, we present the data from a field experiment (EVENT II) in which a Central-European grassland was subjected to increased spring rainfall variability (low, intermediate and extreme rainfall variability without any change to the rainfall amount) and increased mowing frequency (four times compared to twice a year). We assessed biomass production, forage quality parameters, root-length and shoot-root ratio. Enhanced spring rainfall variability reduced midsummer productivity and the leaf N and protein concentrations of a target species, but did not exert any long-term effects on biomass production and forage quality in late summer. However, the increased spring rainfall variability reduced aboveground net primary productivity by 15%. More frequent mowing increased productivity in the first year of the study, but decreased productivity at the end of the second year, showing a decline in the potential for overcompensation after a history of more intense mowing. Generally, more frequent mowing decreased the shoot-root ratio and increased the concentration of leaf N. Increased mowing frequency neither buffered, nor amplified the adverse effects of rainfall variability on productivity, but made leaf N concentrations in early summer more responsive to altered rainfall patterns. These results highlight the fact that even relatively small and short-term alterations to rainfall distribution can reduce production and forage quality, with little buffering capacity of altered mowing frequency. Comparisons with productivity data from the first year of the study, in which both, rainfall distribution and rainfall amount were modified, demonstrate the crucial role of sufficient moisture (annual rainfall amount) for grassland resilience: in this first year, negative effects of extreme rainfall variability lasted until the end of the year. To conclude, increased rainfall variability under climate change will likely affect agricultural yield in temperate meadows. Management strategies to buffer these effects have yet to be developed.

AB The aim of this paper is to examine the role of urban public parks in maintaining connectivity and butterfly assemblages. Using a regression framework, we first test the relative importance of park size and isolation in predicting abundance and species richness of butterfly assemblages across a set of 24 public parks within a large metropolitan area, Marseille (South-East France). Then, we focus on landscape features that affect diversity patterns of the recorded butterfly communities. In this second part, the urban landscape surrounding each park is described (within a 1 x 1 km window) according to two major components: vegetated areas (habitat patches) and impervious or built areas (matrix patches). Specifically, we aim to test whether the incorporation of this built component (matrix) in the landscape analysis provides new insights into the understanding of ecological connectivity in the urban environment. We found a significant effect of both matrix configuration (shape complexity of the built patches) and distance from regional species pool (park isolation) on diversity of butterflies that overrides park size in their contribution to variation in species richness. This result suggests that many previous studies of interactions between biodiversity and urban landscape have overlooked the influence of the built elements.

AB 1. Recent studies have documented shifts in habitat associations of single tropical tree species from one life stage to the next. However, the community-level consequences of such shifts have not been investigated, and it is not clear whether they would amplify, neutralize or completely alter habitat structuring during the transitions to the adult community.
   2. We compared habitat-driven species assemblages at three life stages (i.e. recruitment, juvenile and reproductive stages) and six censuses for tree and shrub species in a fully censused 50-ha plot of Panamanian lowland forest. Habitat types were determined using multivariate regression trees that group areas with similar species composition (i.e. species assemblages) according to their topographical characteristics.
   3. Three topographical variables (a topographical wetness index, slope and elevation) were major determinants of species assemblages. When analysing individuals of all life stages together, we found a distinct and temporally consistent structuring of the plot into four dominant habitat types (low and high plateaus, slope and swamp) which was consistent with previous classifications. Basically, the same habitat structuring emerged for the juvenile communities of individual censuses. However, recruits showed a weak and temporally inconsistent habitat structuring.
   4. A notable homogenization in species assemblages occurred during the transition from juvenile to reproductive, through both a reduction in the number of species assemblages (in 3 censuses, one large reproductive assemblage covered 93% of the plot, and in others, an additional slope habitat emerged) and a reduction in the classification error. Overall, habitat structuring became noisier and weaker over the 25 years of the study.
   5. Synthesis. Our results suggest that mortality processes during the transition from recruits to juveniles must enhance the signal of habitat structuring. However, during the transition to the reproductive stage, species may have lost the advantage of being in the habitat with which they had become associated, or the quality of habitat changed during their life span because of larger climatic changes. The homogeneous assemblages of the reproductive stage could be interpreted as support for neutral theories, but further research is required to unravel the mechanisms behind these intriguing observations.

AB Increasingly government agencies are seeking to quantify the outcomes of proposed policy options in terms of ecosystem service benefits, yet conflicting definitions and ad hoc approaches to measuring ecosystem services have created confusion regarding how to rigorously link ecological change to changes in human well-being. Here, we describe a step-by-step framework for producing ecological models and metrics that can effectively serve an economic-benefits assessment of a proposed change in policy or management. A focus of the framework is developing comparable units of ecosystem goods and services to support decision-making, even if outcomes cannot be monetized. Because the challenges to translating ecological changes to outcomes appropriate for economic analyses are many, we discuss examples that demonstrate practical methods and approaches to overcoming data limitations. The numerous difficult decisions that government agencies must make to fairly use and allocate natural resources provides ample opportunity for interdisciplinary teams of natural and social scientists to improve methods for quantifying changes in ecosystem services and their effects on human well-being. This framework is offered with the intent of promoting the success of such teams as they support managers in evaluating the equivalency of ecosystem service offsets and trades, establishing restoration and preservation priorities, and more generally, in developing environmental policy that effectively balances multiple perspectives.

AB Common carp Cyprinus carpio is a widespread invasive species that, in high abundance, can impose numerous deleterious effects in aquatic ecosystems. Common carp increase turbidity and nutrient availability while reducing invertebrate prey resources and aquatic macrophytes, transforming shallow lakes from the clear- to turbid-water state. However, potential effects of common carp on native fish communities have received limited attention. We evaluated the relationships among relative abundances of nine native fishes and common carp for 81 lakes in eastern South Dakota and their associated physicochemical characteristics. Inverse threshold relationships among relative abundances of native fishes and common carp were identified for black bullhead Ameiurus melas, black crappie Pomoxis nigromaculatus, bluegill Lepomis macrochirus, white bass Morone chrysops and northern pike Esox lucius, while marginally significant relationships were detected for largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides and smallmouth bass M. dolomieu. Lakes where common carp relative abundance exceeded 0.6 fish per net night had low abundance of native fishes, whereas lower abundance of common carp resulted in variable abundance of native fishes. Lakes with abundance of common carp surpassing 0.6 fish per net night were also characterised by larger surface areas and watersheds and impaired water quality (higher dissolved solids and chlorophyll a concentrations and lower secchi depth). Our results are consistent with the biotic-abiotic constraining hypothesis that proposes biotic factors can regulate fish populations regardless of abiotic conditions. Thus, common carp abundance may need to be reduced and sustained below ecological thresholds to improve water quality and increase abundance of native fishes.

AB Nutrient balancing is well known in herbivores and omnivores, but has only recently been demonstrated in predators. To test how a predator might regulate nutrients when the prey varies in nutrient composition, we restricted juvenile Pardosa prativaga wolf spiders to diets of one of six fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, prey types varying in lipid: protein composition during their second instar. We collected all fly remnants to estimate food and nutrient intake over each meal. The spiders adjusted their capture rate and nutrient extraction in response to prey mass and nutrient composition irrespective of energy intake. Intake was initially regulated to a constant lipid plus protein mass, but later spiders fed on prey with high proportions of protein increased consumption relative to spiders fed on other prey types. This pattern indicates that the spiders were prepared to overconsume vast amounts of protein to gain more lipids and energy. The spiders also regulated protein after ingestion, and ingested protein was incorporated less efficiently into body tissue when the prey was protein rich. Despite both pre- and postingestive nutrient regulation, the body lipid: protein compositions of the spiders were highly affected by the nutrient compositions of their prey, and growth in carapace length and lean body mass increased with increasing prey protein: lipid ratio. Our results demonstrate that prey nutrient composition affects these predators, but also that the spiders possess behavioural and physiological adaptations that lead to partial compensation for these effects.

AB The southeastern United States supports one of two large loggerhead turtle (Caretta caretta) nesting aggregations worldwide and is therefore critical to global conservation and recovery efforts for the species. Previous studies have established the presence of four demographically distinct nesting populations (management units) corresponding to beaches from (1) North Carolina through northeastern Florida, (2) peninsular Florida, (3) the Dry Tortugas, and (4) northwest Florida. Temporal and geographic genetic structure of the nesting aggregation was examined utilizing partial mitochondrial control region haplotype frequencies from 834 samples collected over the 2002 through 2008 nesting seasons from 19 beaches as well as previously published haplotype data. Most rookeries did not exhibit interannual genetic variation. However, the interannual variation detected did significantly impact the interpretation of spatial genetic structure in northeastern Florida. Based on pairwise F (ST) comparisons, exact tests of population differentiation, and analysis of molecular variance, the present study upholds the distinctiveness of the four currently recognized management units and further supports recognition of discrete central eastern, southern (southeastern and southwestern), and central western Florida management units. Further subdivision may be warranted, but more intensive genetic sampling is required. In addition, tools such as telemetry and mark-recapture are needed to complement genetic data and overcome limitations of genetic markers in resolving loggerhead turtle rookery connectivity in the southeastern USA.

AB Hepatozoon parasites were examined for the first time in reptiles from the Seychelles Islands. Although both prevalence and intensity were low, Hepatozoon species were detected in individuals from 2 endemic species, the lizard Mabuya wrightii and the snake Lycognathophis seychellensis. This was confirmed using visual identification and through sequencing part of the 18s rRNA gene. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that the Hepatozoon on the Seychelles form a monophyletic lineage, although more data are clearly needed to stabilize estimates of relationships based on this marker.

AB Many aquatic ecosystems have been severely degraded by water-resource development affecting flow regimes and biological connectivity. Freshwater fish have been particularly affected by these changes and climate change will place further stress on them. The Murray-Darling Basin (MDB), Australia, represents a highly affected aquatic system with dramatically modified flow regimes. This has impaired the health of its rivers, and potentially limited the adaptive capacity of its biota to respond to a changing climate. Here, we present our predictions of the potential impacts of climate change on 18 native fish species across their distributional ranges against the back-drop of past and continuing water-resource development (WRD). Because most of these species are found across a wide range of geographical and hydrological settings, we classified the MDB into 10 regions to account for likely variation in climate-change effects, on the basis of latitude, elevation and WRD. Cold water-tolerant species will be under greater stress than are warm water-tolerant species. In some regions, the negative impacts on exotic fish such as trout are likely to improve current conditions for native species. Because the impacts of climate change on any given species are likely to vary from region to region, regional fish assemblages will also be differentially affected. The most affected region is likely to occur in the highly disturbed Lower Murray River region, whereas the dryland rivers that are less affected in the northern MDB are likely to remain largely unchanged. Although climate change is a current and future threat to the MDB fish fauna, the continued over-regulation of water resources will place as much, if not more, stress on the remnant fish species.

AB Reproductive success and its determinants are difficult to infer for wild populations of species with no parental care where behavioural observations are difficult or impossible. In this study, we characterized the breeding system and provide estimates of individual reproductive success under natural conditions for an exhaustively sampled stream-resident brown trout (Salmo trutta) population. We inferred parentage using a full probability Bayesian model that combines genetic (microsatellite) with phenotypic data. By augmenting the potential parents file with inferred parental genotypes from sib-ship analysis in cases where large families had unsampled parents, we could make more precise inference on variance of family size. We observed both polygamous and monogamous matings and large reproductive skew for both sexes, particularly in males. Correspondingly, we found evidence for sexual selection on body size for both sexes. We show that the mating system of brown trout has the potential to be very flexible and we conjecture that environmental uncertainty could be driving the evolution and perhaps select for the maintenance of plasticity of the mating system in this species.

AB Seagrasses structure some of the world's key coastal ecosystems presently in decline due to human activities and global change. The ability to cope with environmental changes and the possibilities for shifts in distribution range depend largely on their evolvability and dispersal potential. As large-scale data usually show strong genetic structure for seagrasses, finer-grained work is needed to understand the local processes of dispersal, recruitment and colonization that could explain the apparent lack of exchange across large distances. We aimed to assess the fine-grained genetic structure of one of the most important and widely distributed seagrasses, Zostera marina, from seven meadows in Brittany, France. Both classic population genetics and network analysis confirmed a pattern of spatial segregation of polymorphism at both regional and local scales. One location exhibiting exclusively the variety 'angustifolia' did not appear more differentiated than the others, but instead showed a central position in the network analysis, confirming the status of this variety as an ecotype. This phenotypic diversity and the high allelic richness at nine microsatellites (2.33-9.67 alleles/locus) compared to levels previously reported across the distribution range, points to Brittany as a centre of diversity for Z. marina at both genetic and phenotypic levels. Despite dispersal potential of several 100 m, a significant pattern of genetic differentiation, even at fine-grained scale, revealed 'genetic patchiness'. Meadows seem to be composed of a mosaic of clones with distinct origins in space and time, a result that calls into question the accuracy of the concept of populations for such partially clonal species.

AB The acceptance of the generalized or unified concept of species (i.e. that species are segments of population lineages) implies that an important task for systematists is to focus on identifying lineages and on testing hypotheses about the acquisition of properties such as phenotypic diagnosability, reciprocal monophyly, or mechanisms of reproductive isolation. However, delimiting species objectively remains one of the most challenging problems faced by biologists. In the present study, we begin to tackle the thorny issue of species delimitation in a complicated group of Neotropical passerine birds (the Arremon torquatus complex, Emberizidae) in which sets of characters vary substantially across space, but do not obviously vary in a concerted fashion. To earlier discussions of species limits in the group, we add a historical perspective offered by a recent molecular phylogeny, present quantitative analyses of morphological and vocal variation, and incorporate ecological niche models as a new tool that aids species delimitation by highlighting cases of ecological distinctiveness and cases where populations appear to be in independent evolutionary trajectories, despite being connected by environments unlikely to represent barriers to gene flow. We demonstrate that at least one pair of taxa (and likely another) currently treated as conspecific are, in fact, distinct lineages that merit species status under essentially any species criterion. However, other pairwise comparisons are not as straightforward owing to nonconcordant patterns of variation in different traits and to the impossibility of distinguishing which characters are causes and which are consequences of reproductive (and evolutionary) isolation. After considering several alternatives, we propose a provisional classification of the complex recognizing eight tentative species-level taxa. Although this classification is likely to change as more detailed work is conducted, it provides a better foundation for studying the biology of these birds and helps to better describe their diversity, which is obscured when all taxa are subsumed into a single species name. The present study highlights several outstanding challenges, both practical and conceptual, for future studies.

AB Spatial planning aimed at Multifunctional agriculture can be seen as a negotiation process on environmental, social and economic aspects of land use. Complexity arises due to the high number of stakeholders and due to the limited knowledge, which is often organized along disciplinary divides. This paper sets out from the premise that the role of agronomy in such land use planning processes can be strengthened by approaches that allow multi-objective and multi-scale evaluation of spatially explicit land use alternatives. We present an application of the explorative Landscape IMAGES framework, which employs the Differential Evolution optimization strategy and the concepts of Pareto optimality that are relatively easy to implement and to combine with spatially explicit indicator assessments. This technique yields a set Of Solutions, each representing a spatial configuration of hedgerows in a landscape along with the performance of the landscape in terms of Pareto rank and efficiency. The methodology was applied in a redesign of the structure of linear landscape elements in an agri-ecological zone in The Netherlands where 7 indicators representing ecological quality, landscape character and implementation costs were considered. The case study was developed in interaction with an NGO involved in landscape management planning and implementation.
   Spatial cohesion in the landscape was found to increase with larger total hedgerow length, but could also be improved without increasing the total length (and therefore costs of establishment and maintenance). Trade-offs existed with other objectives, since this change would involve replacing hedgerows currently positioned in the longitudinal direction (L) of the fields by hedgerows in the transversal direction (T). This change would compromise cultural heritage value as expressed in the LIT ratio, and it would require removal of mature hedgerows in some places and adding of new hedgerows elsewhere in the landscape. thereby increasing implementation costs.
   The approach was evaluated positively in terms of design validity, output validity and end-user validity. The role of the Landscape IMAGES framework in setting a research agenda to enhance the role of agronomy in multifunctional land use planning is discussed. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We describe the spatial and temporal variation in the main characteristics of amphibian breeding habitats in Doana National Park (south of Spain), during two hydrologic cycles with different rainfall amounts and timing (2002-2003 and 2005-2006). We also evaluate amphibian habitat requirements following a model selection approach based on Akaike's Information Criterion. Our results evidenced large spatial variability in all pond characteristics and inter-annual differences in pond hydroperiod, depth, and most water-chemistry characteristics. We observed a remarkable independence of pond characteristics at different sampling dates, suggesting that a pond description based on a single survey may not be representative. Eight of nine amphibian species attempted breeding in both years in spite of the marked inter-annual variability. Habitat models were species-specific and year-specific, as we found inter-annual differences in the pond characteristics relevant for species richness or for the relative abundance of particular species. All these results suggest that this large and diverse network of ponds provides different habitat opportunities each year, favouring the long-term persistence of the whole amphibian community.

AB Reduced genetic diversity can result in short-term decreases in fitness and reduced adaptive potential, which may lead to an increased extinction risk. Therefore, maintaining genetic variation is important for the short- and long-term success of reintroduced populations. Here, we evaluate how founder group size and variance in male reproductive success influence the long-term maintenance of genetic diversity after reintroduction. We used microsatellite data to quantify the loss of heterozygosity and allelic diversity in the founder groups from three reintroductions of tuatara (Sphenodon), the sole living representatives of the reptilian order Rhynchocephalia. We then estimated the maintenance of genetic diversity over 400 years (similar to 10 generations) using population viability analyses. Reproduction of tuatara is highly skewed, with as few as 30% of males mating across years. Predicted losses of heterozygosity over 10 generations were low (1-14%), and populations founded with more animals retained a greater proportion of the heterozygosity and allelic diversity of their source populations and founder groups. Greater male reproductive skew led to greater predicted losses of genetic diversity over 10 generations, but only accelerated the loss of genetic diversity at small population size (< 250 animals). A reduction in reproductive skew at low density may facilitate the maintenance of genetic diversity in small reintroduced populations. If reproductive skew is high and density-independent, larger founder groups could be released to achieve genetic goals for management.

AB 1. The present study used the mountain specialist butterfly Parnassius apollo as a model system to investigate how climate change may alter habitat requirements for species at their warm range margins.
   2. Larval habitat use was recorded in six P. apollo populations over a 700 m elevation gradient in the Sierra de Guadarrama (central Spain). Larvae used four potential host species (Sedum spp.) growing in open areas amongst shrubs.
   3. Parnassius apollo host-plant and habitat use changed as elevation increased: the primary host shifted from Sedum amplexicaule to Sedum brevifolium, and larvae selected more open microhabitats (increased bare ground and dead vegetation, reduced vegetation height and shrub cover), suggesting that hotter microhabitats are used in cooler environments.
   4. Larval microhabitat selection was significantly related to ambient temperature. At temperatures lower than 27 degrees C, larvae occupied open microhabitats that were warmer than ambient temperature, versus more shaded microhabitats that were cooler than ambient conditions when temperature was higher than 27 degrees C.
   5. Elevational changes in phenology influenced the temperatures experienced by larvae, and could affect local host-plant favourability.
   6. Habitat heterogeneity appears to play an important role in P. apollo larval thermoregulation, and may become increasingly important in buffering populations of this and other insect species against climatic variation.

AB Understanding the impacts of landscape-level processes on the population biology of amphibians is critical, especially for species inhabiting anthropogenically modified landscapes. Many pond-breeding amphibians are presumed to exist as metapopulations, but few studies demonstrate the extent and consequences of this metapopulation structure. Gene flow measures may facilitate the construction of more realistic models of population structure than direct measures of migration. This is especially true for species that are cryptic, such as many amphibians. We used eight polymorphic microsatellite loci to determine the genetic population structure of spotted salamanders (Ambystoma maculatum) breeding at 17 ponds in northeastern Ohio, a landscape fragmented by roads, agriculture, urban areas and the Cuyahoga River. Using a variety of analyses (Bayesian clustering, F-statistics, AMOVA) we generated a model of salamander population genetic structure. Our data revealed patterns of genetic connectivity that were not predicted by geographical distances between ponds (no isolation by distance). We also tested for a relationship between population structure and several indices of landscape resistance, but found no effect of potential barriers to dispersal on genetic connectivity. Strong overall connectivity among ponds, despite the hostile habitat matrix, may be facilitated by a network of riparian corridors associated with the Cuyahoga River; however, high gene flow in this system may indicate a general ability to disperse and colonize beyond particular corridors.

AB Previous studies from Central Europe and North America showed that species richness is higher in urban than in rural landscapes. Do protected areas, which can be found in both city and countryside, reflect this species richness pattern? The impact of urban land-use might reduce conservation success and necessitate special management strategies. We compared species richness and species spatial turnover of selected animal and plant taxa (carabids, butterflies, snails, birds, lichens, mosses, vascular plants) in 30 protected areas in the city of Halle and 56 protected areas in the adjacent rural district of Saalkreis (Central Germany). Species were mapped by experienced biologists within a systematic species inventory. We corrected species numbers for the effects of landscape structure (e.g. size, shape and distance of habitats) which might influence species diversity beyond urbanisation effects. Butterflies, birds and lichens had significantly higher species numbers in the rural protected areas. Species spatial turnover was higher among urban areas than among rural areas or pairs of urban and rural areas for most taxa. Diversity in all taxa depended on the size of a protected area. We discussed these patterns in the context of the general urban-rural species diversity patterns. Our results indicate an increasing isolation of species assemblages with urbanisation and highlight that space for protected areas is even more limited in urban than rural areas. An effective conservation of urban species diversity should include both typical urban and semi-natural habitats to cover the full range of species living in cities.

AB There is now overwhelming evidence that an increase in the concentration of greenhouse gases in the Earth's atmosphere has caused global temperatures to increase by 0.6 degrees C since 1900 and further increases of between 1.4 and 5.8 degrees C are predicted over the next century. Changes in climatic conditions have already influenced the demography, phenology and distribution of a wide range of plant and animal taxa. This review focuses on the impacts, both observed and potential, of climate change on birds breeding in temperate woodlands of the Western Palaearctic, a significant proportion of which are currently declining. Changes in ambient temperatures and patterns of precipitation may have direct and indirect effects on the survival rates and productivity of bird species, thus influencing population sizes. For some species or populations, the timing of events such as egg-laying and return from the wintering grounds is also changing in relation to shifts in the peak of food availability during the breeding season. The degree to which different individuals are able to track these temporal changes will have a significant bearing on population sizes and distributions in the future. Unless active management steps are taken, the relatively low dispersal rates of tree species may lead to a decrease in the total area of some woodland habitat types as losses at the southern edge of the range are likely to occur much more quickly than expansion at the northern edge. In addition, the dispersal rates of many woodland birds are themselves low, which could affect their ability to move to new habitat patches if currently occupied areas become unsuitable. Thus, woodland birds may be particularly susceptible to the impacts of climate change.

AB Alternative male mating tactics in species with external fertilization are often viewed as coercive matings by low-quality males, when a male, unable to attract a female himself, steals fertilizations from a spawning pair by adopting 'sneaky' mating tactics, thereby eroding the interests of both the pair-mating male and female. Although a cost of sneaking to guarder males is inevitable, we highlight emerging evidence that females may actually seek and benefit from mating with sneaking males. Sneaking may thus be a means by which females gain access to resources critical for reproduction when these are defended by males adopting a guarder tactic, while maintaining some control over indirect ( genetic) benefits through mate choice. We consider a range of potential costs and benefits that females may obtain from matings that involve sneakers and review empirical studies on female responses to sneaking. We show that the outcome of the trade-off between costs and benefits is context specific and may vary among mating systems, species, populations within species, and individual females within populations. This emerging evidence undermines the view that sneaking necessarily represents forced fertilizations and that sneakers are always low-quality males making 'the best of a bad job'. When females prefer to spawn in the presence of sneaker males, the distinction between deliberate polyandry and sneaking becomes ambiguous and females may only be limited in the expression of their mating preferences by resource monopolization or mate guarding by dominant males, resulting in an intersexual conflict.

AB The Evolutionarily Significant Unit (ESU) was conceptualized in 1986 as a conservation unit below the species level, theoretically applicable to a wide range of taxa. The concept has gained support, and various definitions or criteria, some of which are inconsistent with each other, have since been proposed. Recent critiques of the ESU have pointed out the dominance of definitions biased to the identification of long-term isolation or neutral genetic variation, which has largely ignored the adaptive components. We present here the validity of such claims and show how the ESU definitions have actually been applied in research. We surveyed scientific journals for original papers supporting ESU designations and determined who among the proponents of ESU definitions have gained wider support. Our results indicate that indeed there are inconsistencies with the original concept and with the existing definitions. Although the original concept recommended both ecological and genetic data as the basis for identification of ESUs, which reflect true evolutionary variation, recent definitions have become biased to either neutral genetic variation or adaptive variation. The definition which uses genetic data to assess neutral genetic variation (long-term isolation) has gained major support, and therefore validates the earlier claims. To bridge the gap between the original concept and the practical application, we propose the use of partial ESU and full ESU designations. The application of full ESU should be limited solely to when both information about neutral genetic variation and adaptive variation are available. In other cases, in which only a part of the variation is examined, we should use the term partial ESU (e.g., molecular-based ESU) and continue to investigate focal populations from other aspects of variations to designate full ESU.

AB While toxicological data are available for numerous chemicals from standard tests, little is known on effects of pollutants over several generations or regarding chronic effects of chemicals on genetic diversity. Within the experiments, effects of the model pollutant tributyltin (TBT) were investigated over eleven generations at a sublethal TBT concentration of 4.46 mu g as Sri kg(-1) sediment dw on life-cycle parameters and genetic variability of Chironomus riparius. Moreover, the adaptation potential towards TBT was determined. This experimental design enables the identification of TBT effects on life-cycle parameters and the determination of a potential extinction risk caused by chronic exposure. Furthermore, effects on the genetic structure can be determined, which are not predictable based solely on knowledge of the toxic mode of action of the chemical.
   Genetic variety was determined via microsatellite analysis, measuring individual length differences of highly variable satellite DNA fragments. For the identification of changes in tolerances towards the stressor, acute and chronic toxicity experiments were conducted.
   During the multi-generation study, significant effects on development and reproduction were determined. For some generations, the emergence was significantly (p < 0.05) delayed under TBT exposure. Reproduction seems to be a sensitive parameter as well, whereby females laid significantly larger egg masses (p < 0.05) in the latter generations. TBT did not affect the population growth rate nor the genetic variability, while clear deviations from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium appeared. The study also provides strong evidence for the acquirement of a higher tolerance towards the stressor in the TBT-exposed group. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Reforestation has been suggested as a way to mitigate the effects of tropical rain forest loss. However, factors influencing the successful colonisation of biota into newly created rainforest are poorly understood. We assessed beetle species assemblages with flight interception traps, in sites undergoing rainforest restoration across the largely cleared landscape of the Atherton Tablelands in north-eastern Queensland, Australia. There were two levels of site age (2-4 years and 6-17 years) and two distances from intact rainforest (adjacent and > 0.9 km), with six sites in each treatment, together with six reference sites in each of pasture and small rainforest remnants (n = 36 sites). Multivariate metrics were used to assess the restored sites' relative similarity to pasture and rainforest, in terms of both physical habitat structure and beetle species composition within ten family groups. Older restoration sites were structurally most similar to rainforest. Older sites and those adjacent to rainforest had a more rainforest-like beetle species composition (without significant interaction). However, even the closer and older sites had a substantially lower abundance and richness of rainforest- associated beetles than did rainforest. Age effects were generally stronger than distance effects, with the latter appearing to be entirely driven by rare rainforest species. Beetle assemblage similarity to rainforest was more strongly correlated with structural similarity to rainforest than with age, except within older sites. The use of revegetation techniques which lead to more rainforest-like structural conditions appears to be of over-riding importance in catalysing the rapid acquisition of volant rainforest beetle assemblages in the initial stages of restoration.

AB Climate change in concert with habitat loss and degradation are major threats to global biodiversity. As part of climate change, the occurrence of extreme climatic events is expected to increase. Agricultural intensification has led to the increased homogeneity of agricultural habitats and declines in farmland species diversity. We investigated the abundance of common frog Rana temporaria populations in boreal farmlands in relation to multiple scales of landscape structure during years 2002-2003, and the effect of habitat structure on R. temporaria population persistence during a severe drought. On average, 113 and 24 egg clutches were observed per site in years 2002 and 2003, respectively. This dramatic decline was synchronized over the entire study area (ca. 320 km(2)), with some local variations. Population persistence was higher in sites where ground water levels decreased less but it was also positively correlated with the heterogeneity of the adjacent landscape. Under normal weather conditions, local habitat characteristics had a dominating role on R. temporaria population abundance, as it was positively correlated with the amount of ditches and ponds within the study sites. After the drought, however, population abundance was related to landscape and regional level factors. The results indicate that landscape homogenization can have negative effects on population persistence during climate change. They also show that the scale at which landscape characteristics affect populations can be strongly dependent of processes functioning at large scales, such as weather. In summary, heterogeneous landscapes may lower the risk of regional amphibian population declines under extreme weather perturbations and serve as sources of recovery in postdisturbance recovery phases. Thus, maintaining such areas should be promoted in long-term biodiversity conservation.

AB Question: Is developmental phenotypic plasticity an adaptive trait and therefore more flexible in variable and unpredictable environments?
   Organism: The anuran larvae community encompassing Alytes obstetricans, Pelodytes punetatus, Bufo bufo, B. calamita, Hyla meridionalis, and Rana perezi..
   Methods: In the field, we examined the ecological breadth (spatial and temporal variability) of the six species along a pond permanency gradient in 240 ponds. In the laboratory, we measured developmental plasticity (time to and size at metamorphosis) of each species using two treatments: (1) constant water level and (2) drying treatment. A comparative analysis was undertaken of developmental plasticity and the function of species ecological breadth and their phylogenetic relationship.
   Results: Species that use a wide variety of habitats or unpredictable environments showed a greater plasticity of responses than those occurring in predictable habitats. At the two extremes of the hydroperiod (ephemeral and permanent ponds), specialist developmental phenotypes with limited plasticity occur, whereas species from variable habitats (temporary ponds) can be considered plastic strategists with asymmetric bet-hedging. Our results support the hypothesis that interspecific differences in developmental phenotypic plasticity are adaptive and are related to ecological breadth and unpredictability.

AB Effects of growth temperature and irradiance on nitrogen partitioning among photosynthetic components were studied. Plantago asiatica was grown under different temperature and light conditions. Growth conditions were regulated such that the Chl a/b ratio in leaves grown at a low temperature with a low irradiance was similar to that in leaves grown at a high temperature with a high irradiance, suggesting that the balance between acquisition and utilization of light energy in the photosynthetic apparatus was similar between the two growth conditions. When plotted against the leaf nitrogen content, the RuBP (ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate) carboxylase content did not significantly differ depending on growth conditions. Both high irradiance and low temperature decreased nitrogen partitioning to Chl-protein complexes. Low temperature increased nitrogen allocation to stroma FBPase (fructose-1,6-phosphatase) irrespective of growth irradiance. Gas exchange measurement indicated that the ratio of the electron transport (J(max)) to the maximum carboxylation rate (V-cmax) was not affected by growth irradiance but by growth temperature. It is concluded that nitrogen partitioning between acquisition and utilization of light energy responds to both growth temperature and irradiance, while nitrogen partitioning between carboxylation and regeneration of RuBP responds only to growth temperature.

AB We investigated benefits of polyandry and phenotypic correlates of male mating success in black ratsnakes. We used 10 microsatellite loci to identify the sires of 375 hatchlings from 34 clutches with known mothers. Multiple paternity occurred in 88% of clutches, despite the fact that ratsnakes mate when dispersed. The incidence of multiple paternity did not vary with female size or with clutch size. Hatching success tended to be higher in multiply sired clutches, but offspring from these clutches were not longer or heavier. We identified 34 males as the sires of 144 hatchlings. Most instances where sires could not be identified resulted from exclusion of all 426 potential sires that we screened. Unidentified sires were probably males that hibernated outside our study area and thus were not included in the intensive sampling at hibernacula in the study area. Among males that sired offspring, body size but not tail length contributed to success, consistent with male-biased sexual size dimorphism and made-male combat shown by this species. Large males were more successful primarily by siring more offspring per clutch rather than by siring offspring in more clutches. This may be a result of greater success in sperm competition. Neither body condition nor genetic similarity to the female was related to male mating success. Our results, in conjunction with published data on movement patterns, suggest that snakes of both genders can benefit from actively seeking multiple matings.

AB Frequently disturbed environments, such as intermittent streams, are ecologically useful for studying how disturbance characteristics (e.g. frequency, magnitude) affect community structure and succession. We developed a harshness index that quantifies ecologically pertinent spatial and temporal characteristics of prairie intermittent streams that may limit or reduce diversity and abundance to predict benthic macroinvertebrate assemblage characteristics. The index incorporates 11 variables that describe the hydrological regime (e.g. average flow, flow variability, drying and flooding) and distance to perennial surface water. We started with 27 variables, but removed 16 that did not increase the predictive value of the index. The relationships among index values and annual mean macroinvertebrate assemblage characteristics (taxonomic richness, diversity, evenness and abundance) were tested over two years using seven sites that represent a range of flow permanence (recent and historical), flood magnitude ( recent and historical) and surface-water connectivity. Mean annual taxonomic richness was significantly related to the harshness index. Evenness and abundance were not related to harshness. Further analyses indicated that distance to the nearest permanent habitat was less important than annual or historical hydrological parameters, even though prior research had documented higher rates of colonisation at sites that were closer to nearest permanent habitat. Both annual factors that can alter abundance and colonisation immediately (e.g. floods, drought in each year) and historical factors (e.g. probability of drying, average length of dry period over decades) may influence assemblage characteristics. Historical factors may influence evolutionary adaptations of invertebrates and may predominate when relative disturbance rates are lower such as in years with less flooding.

AB Adult movement and natal dispersal data demonstrate that Northern Goshawks (Accipiter gentilis) are able to travel over long distances, suggesting a large functional population. However, these data are unable to determine whether these movements contribute to gene flow among adjacent breeding areas. We used eight microsatellite DNA loci and mitochondrial DNA control-region sequence data to assess population structure of Northern Goshawks breeding in Utah. Goshawks had moderate levels of genetic variation at microsatellite loci (observed heterozygosity = 50%), similar to levels found in other medium-sized, highly mobile birds. Overall estimates of interpopulation variance in microsatellite alleles (F-ST = 0.011) and mtDNA haplotypes (Phi(ST) = 0.126) were low and not significantly different from zero. Pairwise population comparisons using microsatellite markers revealed no differentiation among sampled sites, indicating that the functional population extends beyond Utah. However, pairwise population analyses of mtDNA uncovered a single case of differentiation between goshawks inhabiting Ashley National Forest, in northeastern Utah, and Dixie National Forest, in southwestern Utah. Low levels of population structuring observed in mtDNA between the two forests may be due to the smaller effective population size sampled by mtDNA, a cline of haplotypes across the West, or the presence of a contact zone between A. g. atricapillus and goshawks of southern Arizona and the Mexican Plateau.

AB The survival probability of an individual may be limited by density-dependent mechanisms and by environmental stochasticity, but can also be modified by individual characteristics. In our study, we investigated over-winter survival of subadults of an enclosed European rabbit Oryctolagus cuniculus population in a temperate zone habitat over the period 1992-2002. We: (1) selected for appropriate models to explain individual variation in over-winter survival and the animals' autumn body mass, the latter was used as a measure of the individual pre-winter body condition; and (2) aimed to compare the sensitivity of the target variables on the realised variation of the factors considered. Model selection based on information theory revealed that individual over-winter survival was best explained by the combination of autumn body mass, winter temperature, population density and sex, where the probability of survival was higher in females than in males. According to this model, the probability of survival reacted most sensitively to variation in the autumn body mass and in winter temperature. Individual autumn body mass was best explained by the combination of the date of birth, population density, and weather conditions by means of the percentage of rainy days during the first 2 months after the animals had emerged above ground, where the autumn body mass was negatively related to the percentage of rainy days. The chosen model suggested that the autumn body mass reacted most sensitively to variation in the date of birth. Combining these models, we found that weather conditions during two different periods of time as well as population density, sex and the date of birth operated together to determine the probability of over-winter survival. In particular, the study points out the high impact of environmental stochasticity on over-winter survival: (1) by direct effects of winter temperature conditions, and (2) by the indirect action of weather conditions to which the animals were exposed during the early period of juvenile development.

AB Sperm competition is common in many insect species; however, the mechanisms underlying differences in sperm precedence are not well understood. In the stalk-eyed fly, Cyrtodiopsis whitei (Diptera, Diopsidae), sperm precedence is influenced by the presence of sex chromosome meiotic drive. When drive-carrying males compete with non-driving males for fertilizations within a female, the number of progeny sired by drive males is significantly fewer than predicted by sperm mixing alone. Thus, drive males apparently suffer not only a reduction in the number of viable sperm produced, but also a reduction in sperm competitive ability. In this study, we manipulated the amount and source of seminal fluid and sperm received by females by interrupting copulations before sperm, but after seminal fluid, was transferred. We find that seminal fluid from another male influences the number of progeny sired by a drive-carrying male when both males mate with the same female. Sperm viability staining reveals that sperm from drive males are incapacitated by seminal fluid from other males within the female reproductive tract. These results suggest that multiple mating by females enables seminal fluid products to interact differentially with sperm and may reduce the transmission advantage of the drive chromosome.

AB The tolerance of indigenous arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) to stressful soil conditions and the relative contribution of spores of these fungi to plant colonization were examined in a Portuguese salt marsh. Glomus geosporum is dominant in this salt marsh. Using tetrazolium as a vital stain, a high proportion of field-collected spores were found to be metabolically active at all sampling dates. Spore germination tests showed that salt marsh spores were not affected by increasing levels of salinity, in contrast to two non-marsh spore isolates, and had a significantly higher ability to germinate under increased levels of salinity (20parts per thousand) than in the absence of or at low salinity (10parts per thousand). Germination of salt marsh spores was not affected by soil water levels above field capacity, in contrast to one of the two non-marsh spore isolates. For the evaluation of infectivity, a bioassay was established with undisturbed soil cores (containing all types of AM fungal propagules) and soil cores containing only spores as AM fungal propagules. Different types of propagules were able to initiate and to expand the root colonization of a native plant species, but spores were slower than mycelium and/or root fragments in colonizing host roots. The AM fungal adaptation shown by this study may explain the maintenance of AMF in salt marshes.

AB The geographical distribution of genetic variation within western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) was examined to clarify the population genetic structure and recent evolutionary history of this group. DNA was amplified from shed hair collected from sites across the range of the three traditionally recognized gorilla subspecies: western lowland (G. g. gorilla), eastern lowland (G. g. graueri) and mountain (G. g. beringei) gorillas. Nucleotide sequence variation was examined in the first hypervariable domain of the mitochondrial control region and was much higher in western lowland gorillas than in either of the other two subspecies. In addition to recapitulating the major evolutionary split between eastern and western lowland gorillas, phylogenetic analysis indicates a phylogeographical division within western lowland gorillas, one haplogroup comprising gorilla populations from eastern Nigeria through to southeast Cameroon and a second comprising all other western lowland gorillas. Within this second haplogroup, haplotypes appear to be partitioned geographically into three subgroups: (i) Equatorial Guinea, (ii) Central African Republic, and (iii) Gabon and adjacent Congo. There is also evidence of limited haplotype admixture in northeastern Gabon and southeast Cameroon. The phylogeographical patterns are broadly consistent with those predicted by current Pleistocene refuge hypotheses for the region and suggest that historical events have played an important role in shaping the population structure of this subspecies.

AB A nuclear low-copy gene phylogeny provides strong evidence for the hybrid origin of seven polyploid species in Geinae ( Rosaceae). In a gene tree, alleles at homoeologous loci in an allopolyploid species are expected to be sisters to orthologues in the ancestral taxa rather than to each other. Alleles at a duplicated locus in an autopolyploid, however, are expected to be more closely related to each other than they are to any orthologous copies in closely related species. We cloned and sequenced about 1.9 kilobases from the 50 end of the GBSSI-1 gene from two diploid, one tetraploid, and six hexaploid species. Each of the three loci in the hexaploid species forms a separate group, two of which are more closely related to copies in other species than they are to each other. This finding indicates that the hexaploid lineage evolved through two consecutive allopolyploidization events. Based on the GBSSI-1 gene tree, we hypothesized that there was an initial hybridization between a diploid species from the ancestral lineage of Coluria and Waldsteinia and an unknown diploid species to form the tetraploid Geum heterocarpum lineage. Backcrossing of G. heterocarpum with a representative of the unknown diploid lineage then resulted in a hexaploid lineage that has radiated considerably since its origin, comprising at least 40 extant species with various morphologies. A penalized likelihood analysis indicated that Geinae may be about 17 million years old, implying that the hypothesized allopolyploid speciation events are relatively ancient. Six of the 22 cloned Geinae GBSSI-1 copies in this study, which all are duplicate copies in polyploid taxa, may have become pseudogenes. We compared the GBSSI-1 phylogeny with one from chloroplast data and explored implications for the evolution of some fruit characters.

AB Sexual selection has traditionally been investigated assuming that male quality is as skewed as patterns of male reproductive success can sometimes be. Recently, female choice has been investigated under the model of genetic compatibility, which assumes that each individual female has her own 'best' mate and there is no overall optimal choice for all females. We investigated female mate choice in the newt species Ttiturus alpestris, a member of a genus where female choice has been investigated only within the context of the optimal male (female choice for condition-dependent traits). We provided females with two males that differed in one condition-dependent trait (body size) and overall genetic composition. Both male body size and female body size did not influence paternity, but the degree of genetic relatedness between females and potential mates did. Two components of fitness (fecundity and hatching success) did not differ between singly and multiply sired clutches, indicating that females do not employ polyandry as a means of increasing offspring fitness through genetic bet-hedging. Instead, we hypothesize that females may mate initially for fertility assurance, but prefer less-related males as the most genetically compatible mates.

AB Plants of C. canephora grown in pots under low nitrogen (LN) or high nitrogen (HN) applications were submitted to either cyclic water stress or daily irrigation. Water deficit led to marked decreases in net carbon assimilation rate (A) and, to a lesser extent, in stomatal conductance (g(s)), regardless of the N treatments. In well-watered plants, A appreciably increased in HN plants relative to LN plants without significant changes in g(s). As a whole, changes in internal CO2 concentration predominantly reflected changes in A rather than in g(s). Under irrigated conditions, A, but not g(s), correlated with leaf N concentration in a curvilinear way. Photosynthetic nitrogen-use efficiency was considerably low, and decreased with increasing leaf N concentration. Limited N, but not water, slightly decreased the maximum photochemical efficiency of photosystem II (PSII). Under continuous irrigation, LN plants had a smaller quantum yield of electron transport (Phi(PSII)) through slight decreases of photochemical quenching (q(p)) and capture efficiency of excitation energy by open PSII reaction centres, and increases in Stern-Volmer non-photochemical quenching. Under water-stressed conditions, changes in PSII photochemistry were apparent only in HN plants, with a 25 % decrease in Phi(PSII), due mainly to variations in q(p). Biochemical constraints, rather than stomatal or photochemical limitations, provoked the decreases in A under limited supply of either N or water.

AB Rice roots are commonly shallow in rainfed lowland conditions. Mechanical impedance is one factor that may restrict access of roots to deeper soil layers, thereby reducing the capacity of the root system to extract water from depth during late-season drought. The capacity of rice roots to penetrate hardpans was examined in experiments at Rajshahi, Bangladesh, in the 1994 wet season. Eight lines (CT9993, IR52561, IR58821, IR62266, KDML105, Mahsuri, Namsagui19, and IR20) were grown in three experiments: irrigated early, rainfed early, and tainted late. As drought intensified from heading to dough stage, soil penetration resistance increased to 3.0 MPa at 15-25 cm depth in both rainfed experiments. A high proportion of the total root length was found in the surface layer, particularly in IR20. CT9993 and IR58821 had thicker roots than other lines. Root length density (RLD) increased in deeper soil layers in rainfed with time, but lines differed in their capacity to penetrate the compacted layer as drought intensified after heading. Only IR58821 and Mahsuri were able to increase RLD below 15 cm depth after heading to values greater than 1.6 cm cm(-3), and only in the rainfed early experiment. In rainfed late, soil penetration resistance tended to increase after heading in IR20, IR52561 and IR62266, implying these lines were able to extract water below 15 cm depth, but without the concomitant increase in RLD. The greater penetration ability of Mahsuri and IR58821 was expressed in both rainfed environments at high soil penetration resistance. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V All rights reserved.

AB Under a neutral model, the stochastic lineage sorting that leads to gene monophyly proceeds slowly in large populations. Therefore, in many recent species with large population size, the genome will have mixed support for monophyly unless historical bottlenecks have accelerated coalescence. We use genealogical patterns in mitochondrial DNA and in introns of four nuclear loci to test for historical bottlenecks during the speciation and divergence of two temperate Lagenorhynchus dolphin species isolated by tropical Pacific waters (an antitropical distribution). Despite distinct morphologies, foraging behaviors, and mitochondrial DNAs, these dolphin species are polyphyletic at all four nuclear loci. The abundance of shared polymorphisms between these sister taxi is most consistent with the maintenance of large effective population sizes (5.09x10(4) to 10.9x10(4)) during 0.74-1.05 million years of divergence. A variety of population size histories are possible, however. We used gene tree coalescent probabilities to explore the rejection region for historical bottlenecks of different intensity given best estimates of effective population size under a strict isolation model of divergence. In L. obliquidens the data are incompatible with a colonization propagule of an effective size of 10 or fewer individuals. Although the ability to reject less extreme historical bottlenecks will require data from additional loci, the intermixed genealogical patterns observed between these dolphin sister species are highly probable only under an extended history of large population size. If similar demographic histories are inferred for other marine antitropical taxa, a parsimonious model fur the Pleistocene origin of these distributions would not involve rare breaches of a constant dispersal barrier by small colonization propagules. Instead, a history of large population size in L. obliquidens and L. obscures contributes to growing biological and environmental evidence that the equatorial barrier became permeable during glacial/interglacial cycles, Leading to vicariant isolation of antitropical populations.

AB Experiments were conducted over the period 1987-94 at Cambridge University Farm and two other sites to examine the effect of various husbandry factors, particularly variety and irrigation regime, on rate, depth and density of rooting in potatoes, Maximum rooting depth ranged from 59 to 140 cm, indicating that potatoes can root to considerable depths and thereby have access to large volumes of water to satisfy the potential demand for water created by,the atmospheric conditions and the size of the canopy. Root extension vertically through the soil profile was best described as a three-phase process: an initial rapid period lasting 3-5 weeks with growth rates c. 1.2 cm/day, a second period of slower growth (c. 0.8 cm/day), followed by cessation of root extension for the rest of the life of the crop. Variety had a major influence on the ultimate depth of rooting, primarily owing to variations in the length of the different periods of rooting rather than the rate in each period. It was observed that changes in the rate, or the cessation of root penetration were always preceded 4-9 days earlier by a change in the rate, or cessation, of leaf appearance. This feature should make it possible to characterize the duration of rooting of varieties through measurement of leaf emergence. Varieties which ceased leaf production early, such as Atlantic, were found to have a duration of root growth of c. 60 days, with Cara rooting for c. 30 days longer. Maximal total root length (TRL) and root length density (RLD) in the experiments reported were 16.9 km/m(2) and 5.5 cm/cm(3), respectively, similar to those found previously in potatoes and crops such as sugar beet, but considerably greater than many other vegetables. Rooting density decreased with depth, but the root systems were not as surface-oriented as many other studies have shown. When TRL was close to its maximum, the vertical distribution of RLD showed that between 40 and 73% was confined to the upper 30 cm, with irrigated crops possessing a greater proportion of their roots in the plough layer. Despite being planted in rows 70-91 cm apart, rooting systems were homogeneously distributed in a horizontal direction by c. 35 days after emergence, at which time the roots had reached a depth of c. 50 cm. Therefore, apart from a short period after emergence, the potato crop is capable of accessing considerable volumes of soil from which to extract water and nutrients. Ensuring that soil conditions are conducive to maximal rates of root growth should be the target for growers, since this will lead to a more efficient use of soil water and irrigation.

AB Geographical variation in two related seabird species, the razorbill (Alca torch) and common guillemot (Uria aalge), was investigated using sequence analysis of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control regions. We determined the nucleotide sequence of the variable 5' segment of the control region in razorbills and common guillemots from breeding colonies across the Atlantic Ocean. The ecology and life history characteristics of razorbill and common guillemot are in many respects similar. They are both considered highly philopatric and have largely overlapping distributions in temperate and subarctic regions of the North Atlantic, yet the species were found to differ widely in the extent and spatial distribution of mtDNA variation. Moreover, the differences in genetic differentiation and diversity were in the opposite direction to that expected from a consideration of traditional classifications and current population sizes. Indices of genetic diversity were highest in razorbill and varied among colonies, as did genotype frequencies, suggestive of restrictions to gene flow. The distribution of genetic variation suggests that razorbills originated from a refugial population in the south-western Atlantic Ocean through sequential founder events and subsequent expansion in the east and north. In common guillemots, genetic diversity was low and there was a lack of geographical structure, consistent with a recent population bottleneck, expansion and gene flow. We suggest that the reduced level of genetic diversity and differentiation in the common guillemot is caused by an inherent propensity for repeated population bottlenecks and concomitantly unstable population structure related to their specialized feeding ecology.

AB Increased nitrogen supply stimulates plant growth and photosynthesis. Since it was shown that heavy metals may cause deficiencies of essential nutrients in plants the potential reversal of cadmium toxicity by increased N nutrition was investigated. The effects on photosynthesis of low Cd (0, 0.5, 2 or 5 mmol m(-3)) combined with three N treatments (2, 7.5 or 10 mol m(-3)) were examined in young sunflower plants. Chlorophyll fluorescence quenching parameters were determined at ambient CO2 and at 100 or 800 mu mol quanta m(-2) s(-1). The vitality index (R-fd) decreased approx. three-times in response to 5 mmol m(-3) Cd, at 2 and 10 mol m(-3) N. The maximum photochemical efficiency of PSII reaction centres (F-v/F-m) was not influenced by Cd or N treatment. The highest Cd concentration decreased quantum efficiency of PSII electron transport (Phi(II)) by 30 %, at 2 and 10 mol m(-3) N, mostly due to increased closure of PSII reaction centres (q(p)). Photosynthetic oxygen evolution rates at saturating CO2 were decreased in plants treated with 5 mmol m(-3) Cd, at all N concentrations. The results indicate that Cd treatment affected the ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP) regeneration capacity of the Calvin cycle more than other processes. At the same time, the amounts of soluble and ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) protein increased with Cd treatment. Decreased photosynthesis, but substantially increased Rubisco content, in sunflower leaves under Cd stress indicate that a significant amount of Rubisco protein is not active in photosynthesis and could have another function. It is shown that optimal nitrogen nutrition decreases the inhibitory effects of Cd in young sunflower plants. (C) 2000 Annals of Botany Company.

AB The contribution of plant quality to the population dynamics of herbivorous insects has been an issue of much controversy. Many studies have documented how variable plant quality differentially influences the survival and fecundity of insect individuals. Whether or not such effects can be translated to the level of insect populations is, however. not clear. In order to test this hypothesis one needs to combine processes at both the level of the individual and the population This is difficult with an empirical approach, but could be achieved by means of modeling given that appropriate data exist for both levels of organization. In this paper Ne report on a model developed to analyze whether altered Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) quality can contribute to the build-up of populations of the European pine sawfly (Neodiprion sertifer). Experimental data on responses of sawfly larvae to variable plant quality, i.e. needle concentrations of resin acids, were used to parameterize the model. Larval survival and sawfly fecundity are reduced at high resin acid concentrations. However, high resin acid concentrations are, at the same time, beneficial because larval defense against predators is enhanced. in the model, data on individual responses were combined with Literature data at the population level, a type III functional response related to cocoon predation was presumed to be the density-dependent process regulating sawfly populations. The analysis showed that the risk for an outbreak is high when needle resin acid concentration (,) or larval predation pressure (p) is low. When r or p is high there is no risk. By analyzing different scenarios it was found that small changes in r and p can result in the sawfly population moving from low to high outbreak risk. Changes of the same, or larger, magnitude in r have been observed in empirical studies. The role of tritrophic interactions was also considered. This was done by removing the positive effects of resin acids on larval performance in the model. It was found that the anti-predator defense of N. sertifer makes it prone to outbreak under wider combinations of r and p than an insect without the defense. We conclude that small changes in a density-independent factor, such as needle chemistry, can have significant effects on herbivore population dynamics because increased fecundity and survival caused by needle quality may allow the population to escape the control of density-dependent factors, such as cocoon predation.

AB We studied timing of breeding in four species of hole-nesting passerines, the Siberian tit (Poecile cinctus), great tit (Parus major), pied flycatcher (Ficedula hypoleuca), and redstart (Phoenicurus phoenicurus), and the abundance of the arthropods in their diet (ground-dwelling spiders, winged insects, foliage-feeding lepidopteran and hymenopteran larvae) in Finnish Lapland for 6-12 years. Densities of the invertebrate groups varied considerably, both seasonally and annually. All the bird species started to breed in early summer, when weather conditions were often poor. At the beginning of the breeding season all species relied on ground-dwelling spiders, whose abundances peaked early and were less variable over the years than those of insects. Abundances and timing of emergence of caterpillars in birch and pine canopies (the major food sources for foliage-gleaners) were highly variable, but each year their abundances peaked in July or August, after the nestling period of the birds. This contrasts with reported cases in deciduous forests at midlatitudes and shows that at our site the birds did not time their nestling period ultimately to coincide with peak food availability. Mean clutch sizes declined seasonally in the tit species and the pied flycatcher but not in the redstart. The number of fledglings did not depend on laying date, except in the Siberian tit, for which dependence of fledgling number on laying date varied among years. Although early broods were not more productive (i.e., greater number of fledglings) than later ones, early breeding is ultimately a necessity for recruitment because of the short subarctic summer. Birds cannot delay breeding in the north because late breeding would shorten the time available for moulting, food-hoarding, and preparation for migration or wintering. Our results show that at the time of egg laying, passerines may receive proximate cues to allow them to predict food conditions during the nestling period. Still, exact prediction of food availability during later phases of nesting is constrained by an inherent discrepancy between warm-blooded birds and poikilothermic invertebrates: once a bird has started egg laying, the subsequent phases follow nearly automatically on certain calendar dates, whereas the development of the arthropods depends on the rate of temperature increase.

AB Species of coral-reef fish that exhibit dominance hierarchies provide opportunities for experimental studies of intraspecific competition within discrete social groups. The fairy basslet Gramma loreto (Grammatidae) lives in dominance hierarchies that occupy the undersides of open reef ledges in the Caribbean region. Each hierarchy is maintained by aggression between size classes such that larger fish occupy prime plankton-feeding positions closer to the outer edge of the ledge. We conducted a removal experiment in the central Bahamas to determine the role of larger fish in maintaining the hierarchy and the resultant consequences to smaller fish. When larger fish were removed, smaller individuals quickly occupied these prime feeding positions and were the recipients of less aggression compared to controls. As a result, the average feeding rates of smaller fish were more than 60% higher in aggregations in which larger fish had been removed. Differences in feeding rates were the result of 2 types of competitive effects: between-position and within-position. The between-position effect was the result of differential feeding rates associated with different feeding positions within an aggregation. The within-position effect was due to interactions within a given feeding position. Although both effects strongly influenced basslet feeding rate, the magnitude of the within-position effect was roughly 3 times that of the between-position effect. Together, these 2 components of competition may affect demographic rates and ultimately contribute to local population regulation.

AB To elucidate the systematic status of the enigmatic saola (Pseudoryx nghetinhensis), a new bovid genus recently discovered in Vietnam, and to investigate phylogenetic relationships within the family Bovidae, four distinct DNA markers were sequenced. Complete mitochondrial cytochrome b (1143 bp) and 12S rRNA (956 bp) genes and non-coding regions from the nuclear genes for aromatase cytochrome P-450 (199 bp) and lactoferrin (338 bp) have been compared for 25 bovid species and three Cervidae and Antilocapridae outgroups. Independent and/or combined analyses of the four nucleotide matrices through maximum parsimony and maximum-likelihood methods indicated that Bovidae consists of two major lineages, i.e. Bovinae which contains the tribes Bovini, Boselaphini and Tragelaphini, and Antilopinae which encompasses all other bovids. Within Bovinae, the tribe Bovini is divided into buffalo Bovini (Bubalus and Syncerus) and cattle Bovini (Bos and Risen) and Tragelaphini are possibly related to Boselaphini. Pseudoryx is shown to be (i) robustly nested within Bovinae; (ii) strongly associated with Bovini; and (iii) tentatively sharing a sister-group relationship with cattle Bovini. Within Antilopinae, three robust clades are in evidence: (i) Hippotragus and Damaliscus are linked to Ovis; (ii) Aepyceros joins Neotragus; and (iii) Cephalophus clusters with Oreotragus.

AB Concatenated sequences of all protein-coding genes in mitochondria recovered a known phylogeny of 11 vertebrate species correctly with statistical significance. However, when it was rooted by lampreys or sea urchins, the root of the vertebrate tree was placed between the mammal cluster and the chicken-frog-fish cluster or between the mammal-chicken cluster and the frog-fish cluster, depending on the tree-making method used. Although the frog-fish or chicken-frog-fish cluster was biologically incorrect it was again supported with a significantly high bootstrap value. In this study, we investigated the reasons why this happened. It has been suggested that an incorrect phylogeny may be constructed due to a change of amino acid composition in different lineages or due to hornoplasies at sites with hydrophobic amino acids. However, our results indicated that these were not the causes of the incorrect rooting of the vertebrate tree. Rather, it was important to take into account an extensive rate variation across sites and different probabilities of substitution among different amino acids. The substitution rates for mitochondrial sequences vary considerably for different vertebrate lineages. In such a case, it is known to be important to use the model that reflects the actual substitution probability to obtain a correct tree topology. The correct rooting of the vertebrate tree was recovered when rate variation across sites was properly accounted for.

AB 1 The role of nutrient supply and defoliation on the competitive interactions between pot-grown Calluna vulgaris and Nardus stricta plants was investigated.
   2 Young plants were grown alone and together in pots under a combination of fertilizer and defoliation treatments. After 18 months, parameters reflecting both above- and below-ground performance were measured, namely: total above-ground biomass, shoot nitrogen and phosphorus content, root length and the extent of mycorrhizal infection of the roots.
   3 In the pots that received fertilizer, the shoot nutrient content and above-ground biomass of Nardus plants increased to a greater extent than those of Calluna plants; this effect was more marked for Nardus plants growing with Calluna plants than for those growing with other Nardus plants. In contrast, Calluna plants growing in competition with Nardus failed to respond to the addition of nutrients. However, in unfertilized pots, Calluna gained more above-ground biomass during the experimental period than Nardus.
   4 Calluna had greater root length than Nardus, but Nardus had a higher proportion of its root length infected by mycorrhizal fungi. In both plants, the addition of fertilizer reduced the mycorrhizal infection and increased the root length. Nardus root length was decreased when grown in competition with Calluna only in pots where no nutrients were added. Defoliation decreased the extent of mycorrhizal infection in Calluna roots but not in those of Nardus: defoliation decreased the shoot nutrient content in Calluna plants, but not in Nardus plants.
   5 These results suggest that the competitive balance between Nardus and Calluna may be altered by the addition of nutrients, and by defoliation, which may have serious implications for the future dominance of Calluna in heathland ecosystems, particularly those where nutrient inputs are increasing significantly or where grazing pressures are high.

AB The effects of elevated atmospheric CO and increased wet N deposition on leaf quality and insect herbivory were evaluated in nine model ecosystems composed of 7-year-old spruce trees (Picea abies) and three understorey species established on natural forest soil. Each model ecosystem was grown in a simulated montane climate, and was exposed to one of three CO2 concentrations (280, 420, and 560 mu l l(-1)) and to one of three levels of N deposition (0, 30, and 90 kg ha(-1) year(-1)) for 3 years. In the 3rd year of the experiment second to third instars of the nun moth (Lymantria monacha) were allowed to feed directly on current-year needles of top canopy branches of each tree for 13 days. Specific leaf area (SLA), water content, and N concentration decreased in needles exposed to elevated CO2, whereas the concentrations of starch, condensed tannins, and total phenolics increased. Increased N deposition had no significant effect on SLA, and water content, but the concentrations of starch, condensed tannins, and total phenolics decreased, and sugar and N concentrations increased. Despite higher relative consumption rates (RCRs) larvae consumed 33% less N per unit larval biomass and per day at the two high CO2 treatments, compared to those feeding on 280 mu l l(-1)-needles, but they maintained similar N accumulation rates due to increased N utilization efficiencies (NUE). However, over the 12-day experimental period larvae gained less N overall and reached a 35% lower biomass in the two high-CO2 treatments compared to those at 280 mu l l(-1). The effects of increased N deposition on needle quality and insect performance were generally opposite to those of CO enrichment, but were lower in magnitude. We conclude that altered needle quality in response to elevated CO2 will impair the growth and development of L. monacha larvae. Increasing N deposition may mitigate these effects, which could lead to altered insect herbivore distributions depending on regional patterns of N deposition.

AB The three dimensional distribution of intercepted radiation, intercellular CO2 concentration (C-i) and late summer needle nitrogen (N) concentration were determined at the tips of all 54 branches in a 6.2-m-tall Pinus radiata D, Don tree growing in a New Zealand plantation. Measurements included above- and below-canopy irradiance, leaf stable carbon isotopic composition (delta(13)C) and tree canopy architecture. The radiation absorption component of the model, MAESTRO, was tested on site and then used to determine the branch tip distribution of intercepted radiation. We hypothesized that in branch tip needles: (i) the allocation of nitrogen and other nutrients would be closely associated with the distribution of intercepted radiation, reflecting carbon gain optimization theory, and (ii) C-i would predominantly reflect changes in photosynthetic rate (A) rather than stomatal conductance (g(s)), indicating that the increase in A for a given increase in N concentration was larger than the corresponding increase in g(s). Needle nitrogen concentration was poorly related to intercepted radiation, regardless of the period over which the latter was calculated. At a given height, there was a large azimuthal variation in intercepted radiation but N concentration was remarkably uniform around the tree canopy, There was, however, a linear and positive correspondence between N concentration and delta(13)C and needle height above ground (r(2) = 0.73 and 0.68, respectively). The very strong linear correspondence between N concentration and C-i (r(2) = 0.71) was interpreted, using gas exchange measurements, as supporting our second hypothesis. Recognizing the strong apical control in P. radiata and possible effects of leaf nitrogen storage in an evergreen species, we propose that the tree leader must have constituted a very strong carbon sink throughout the growing season, and that the proximity of branch tip needles to the leader affected their photosynthetic capacity and nutrient concentration, independent of intercepted radiation. This implies an integrated internal determination of resource allocation within the tree and challenges the current convention that resources are optimally distributed according to the profile of intercepted radiation.

ID GROWTH
AB The effects of Rht alleles on root growth and distribution in isogenic lines of spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) are described under different environmental conditions. Above-ground biomass, root length, root dry-weight and their distribution along the soil profile were measured by destructive sampling for growth of aerial biomass and extraction of soil cores containing roots. Field-experiments were conducted under non-limiting water and nutritional conditions during two consecutive years, using an early and a late sowing date each year.
   Dwarfing genes significantly reduced plant height and above-ground biomass at anthesis. In addition, stem mass ratio also was reduced with increases in the allelic dosage. Conversely, total root length and root dry-weight per unit area at anthesis were increased with decreased plant height, therefore, root mass ratio tended to be negatively correlated with plant height. Differences in distribution of root length and root dry-weight through the soil profile among lines were largely confined to the upper soil layers (i.e. the top 30 cm).
   Differences in root dry-weight were more important than in root length, so that the dwarf line had the highest root mass per unit root length. Furthermore, a significant positive correlation between the root mass ratio and stem mass per unit stem length was found. It is suggested that increases in root mass per unit root length associated with Rht alleles are evidencing a surplus of photoassimilates during stem elongation which are used for thickening the roots due to the lack of alternative sinks. Agronomic implications of this effect are discussed.

AB This paper describes an experiment in which the effects of soil phosphorus (P) on root growth and mycorrhizal colonization of Cucumis sativus L. were studied. The aim was to determine the relative contributions of root growth, formation of new infections and growth of infections within the root to the % colonization. Plants were harvested daily between 7 and 24 d. Added P had no effect on root or shoot f. wt or on root length up to 14 d. After that time plants given additional P grew well, but those with no added P grew poorly and showed signs of P deficiency. Increase in root length with added P was due both to an increase in the number of root apices produced per unit length of root per unit time and to an increase in the mean rate of extension of those apices. Effects of P on the % colonization of the roots by the mycorrhizal fungus Glomus intraradices Schenk and Smith were apparent before any effects on root length were observed. The length of the lag phase was not affected by addition of P. The rate of formation of new entry points was similar with and without added P up to 15 d, and reduction in % colonization up to this time could be attributed entirely to reduction in the rate of growth of infection units within the roots. Later, there was a marked increase in the rate of formation of (secondary) entry points in the absence of added P, which was not observed when P was added. At 15, 20 and 25 d, additional plants were harvested to quantify the development of arbuscules and vesicles in colonized regions of the roots. At all three times, numbers of arbuscules and vesicles were lower with added P. We conclude that at very early stages of colonization P exerts its effect via reduced growth of infection units. After approx. 2 wk, an increase in the rate of growth in length of roots and low rates of formation of secondary infections also contribute to the low values of % colonization.

AB Understanding the likely future impacts of biological invasions is crucial yet highly challenging given the multiple relevant environmental, socio-economic and societal contexts and drivers. In the absence of quantitative models, methods based on expert knowledge are the best option for assessing future invasion trajectories. Here, we present an expert assessment of the drivers of potential alien species impacts under contrasting scenarios and socioecological contexts through the mid-21st century. Based on responses from 36 experts in biological invasions, moderate (20%-30%) increases in invasions, compared to the current conditions, are expected to cause major impacts on biodiversity in most socioecological contexts. Three main drivers of biological invasions-transport, climate change and socio-economic change-were predicted to significantly affect future impacts of alien species on biodiversity even under a best-case scenario. Other drivers (e.g. human demography and migration in tropical and subtropical regions) were also of high importance in specific global contexts (e.g. for individual taxonomic groups or biomes). We show that some best-case scenarios can substantially reduce potential future impacts of biological invasions. However, rapid and comprehensive actions are necessary to use this potential and achieve the goals of the Post-2020 Framework of the Convention on Biological Diversity.

AB Worldwide, forests are increasingly affected by nonnative insects and diseases, some of which cause substantial tree mortality. Forests in the United States have been invaded by a particularly large number (>450) of tree-feeding pest species. While information exists about the ecological impacts of certain pests, region-wide assessments of the composite ecosystem impacts of all species are limited. Here we analyze 92,978 forest plots distributed across the conterminous United States to estimate biomass loss associated with elevated mortality rates caused by the 15 most damaging nonnative forest pests. We find that these species combined caused an additional ( i. e., above background levels) tree mortality rate of 5.53 TgC per year. Compensation, in the form of increased growth and recruitment of nonhost species, was not detectable when measured across entire invaded ranges but does occur several decades following pest invasions. In addition, 41.1% of the total live forest biomass in the conterminous United States is at risk of future loss from these 15 pests. These results indicate that forest pest invasions, driven primarily by globalization, represent a huge risk to US forests and have significant impacts on carbon dynamics.

AB In the face of increasing cumulative effects from human and natural disturbances, sustaining coral reefs will require a deeper understanding of the drivers of coral resilience in space and time. Here we develop a high-resolution, spatially explicit model of coral dynamics on Australia's Great Barrier Reef (GBR). Our model accounts for biological, ecological and environmental processes, as well as spatial variation in water quality and the cumulative effects of coral diseases, bleaching, outbreaks of crown-of-thorns starfish (Acanthaster cf. solaris), and tropical cyclones. Our projections reconstruct coral cover trajectories between 1996 and 2017 over a total reef area of 14,780 km(2), predicting a mean annual coral loss of -0.67%/year mostly due to the impact of cyclones, followed by starfish outbreaks and coral bleaching. Coral growth rate was the highest for outer shelf coral communities characterized by digitate and tabulate Acropora spp. and exposed to low seasonal variations in salinity and sea surface temperature, and the lowest for inner-shelf communities exposed to reduced water quality. We show that coral resilience (defined as the net effect of resistance and recovery following disturbance) was negatively related to the frequency of river plume conditions, and to reef accessibility to a lesser extent. Surprisingly, reef resilience was substantially lower within no-take marine protected areas, however this difference was mostly driven by the effect of water quality. Our model provides a new validated, spatially explicit platform for identifying the reefs that face the greatest risk of biodiversity loss, and those that have the highest chances to persist under increasing disturbance regimes.

AB Shale oil and gas resources contribute significantly to the energy production in the U.S. Greenhouse gas emissions come from combustion of fossil fuels from potential sources of power plants, oil refineries, and flaring or venting of produced gas (primarily methane) in oilfields. Economic utilization of greenhouse gases in shale reservoirs not only increases oil or gas recovery, but also contributes to CO2 sequestration. In this paper, the feasibility and efficiency of gas injection approaches, including huff-n-puff injection and gas flooding in shale oil/gas/condensate reservoirs are discussed based on the results of in-situ pilots, and experimental and simulation studies. In each section, one type of shale reservoir is discussed, with the following aspects covered: (1) Experimental and simulation results for different gas injection approaches; (2) mechanisms of different gas injection approaches; and (3) field pilots for gas injection enhanced oil recovery (EOR) and enhanced gas recovery (EGR). Based on the experimental and simulation studies, as well as some successful field trials, gas injection is deemed as a potential approach for EOR and EGR in shale reservoirs. The enhanced recovery factor varies for different experiments with different rock/fluid properties or models incorporating different effects and shale complexities. Based on the simulation studies and successful field pilots, CO2 could be successfully captured in shale gas reservoirs through gas injection and huff-n-puff regimes. The status of flaring gas emissions in oilfields and the outlook of economic utilization of greenhouse gases for enhanced oil or gas recovery and CO2 storage were given in the last section. The storage capacity varies in different simulation studies and is associated with well design, gas injection scheme and operation parameters, gas adsorption, molecular diffusion, and the modelling approaches.

AB Ecological niche modeling (ENM) is used widely to study species' geographic distributions. ENM applications frequently involve transferring models calibrated with environmental data from one region to other regions or times that may include novel environmental conditions. When novel conditions are present, transferability implies extrapolation, whereas, in absence of such conditions, transferability is an interpolation step only. We evaluated transferability of models produced using 11 ENM algorithms from the perspective of interpolation and extrapolation in a virtual species framework. We defined fundamental niches and potential distributions of 16 virtual species distributed across Eurasia. To simulate real situations of incomplete understanding of species' distribution or existing fundamental niche (environmental conditions suitable for the species contained in the study area; N*(F)), we divided Eurasia into six regions and used 1-5 regions for model calibration and the rest for model evaluation. The models produced with the 11 ENM algorithms were evaluated in environmental space, to complement the traditional geographic evaluation of models. None of the algorithms accurately estimated the existing fundamental niche (N*(F)) given one region in calibration, and model evaluation scores decreased as the novelty of the environments in the evaluation regions increased. Thus, we recommend quantifying environmental similarity between calibration and transfer regions prior to model transfer, providing an avenue for assessing uncertainty of model transferability. Different algorithms had different sensitivity to completeness of knowledge of N*(F), with implications for algorithm selection. If the goal is to reconstruct fundamental niches, users should choose algorithms with limited extrapolation when N*(F) is well known, or choose algorithms with increased extrapolation when N*(F) is poorly known. Our assessment can inform applications of ecological niche modeling transference to anticipate species invasions into novel areas, disease emergence in new regions, and forecasts of species distributions under future climate conditions.

AB Ontogenetic shifts in plants are ubiquitous, but their ecological and evolutionary significance remain largely unknown. Juveniles have few opportunities to accumulate sufficient biomass to withstand damage, whereas adults allocate resources to reproduction. Thus, age-specific environmental filters are expected to drive selection towards specific resource-investment strategies for each developmental stage. We tested whether species exhibited strategies that favour faster rates of biomass accumulation during early developmental stages to cope with vulnerability, shifting towards habitat-dependent strategies to optimise resource acquisition and use later on. We also hypothesised that juveniles exhibit greater intraspecific variability of strategies than adults, as a result of continuous filtering of traits throughout the plant's development towards adulthood. We measured key leaf traits-leaf area (LA), leaf dry matter content (LDMC) and specific leaf area (SLA)-and calculated scores for competitor (C), stress-tolerator (S), ruderal (R) strategies of the CSR system for juveniles of 54 species and conspecific adults of 27 species naturally occurring either in unproductive (grassland) or productive (forest) habitats. Juveniles exhibited higher SLA and LA and lower LDMC, and thus a more R-strategy in both habitats when compared with adults, but were not necessarily "R" in absolute terms. We also found smaller intraspecific variation for the R-strategy in adults compared with juveniles in both habitats, whereas the variation of the other strategies was habitat dependent. Ontogenetic shifts in ecological strategies appear to have been selected as a response to ontogeny-dependent filters. Thus, strategies that favour less costly leaves and faster growth rates (relatively R-selected) in juveniles shift towards C and/or S strategies in adulthood, depending on habitat productivity. Nevertheless, habitat-dependent specialisation seems to be a major driver of ecological strategy selection in juveniles. Our study reveals ontogeny-dependent strategies, offering a new approach to integrate plant development and functional specialisation. A is available for this article.

AB Despite the ubiquitous distributions and critical ecological functions of microorganisms in pedogenesis and ecosystem development in recently deglaciated areas, there are contrasting successional trajectories among bacteria and fungi, but the driving forces of community assembly still remain poorly resolved. In this study, we analyzed both bacterial and fungal lineages associated with seven different stages in the Hailuogou Glacier Chronosequence, to quantify their taxonomic composition and successional dynamics, and to decipher the relative contribution from the bottom-up control of soil nutrients and altered vegetation as well as top-down pressures from nematode grazers. Co-occurrence networks showed that the community complexity for both bacteria and fungi typically peaked at the middle chronosequence stages. The overlapping nodes mainly belonged to Proteobacteria and Acidobacteria in bacteria, and Ascomycota and Basidiomycota in fungi, which was further supported by the indicator species analysis. Variation in partitioning and structural equation modeling suggested that edaphic properties were the primary agents shaping microbial community structures, especially at the early stages. The importance of biotic factors, including plant richness and nematode feeding, increased during the last two stages along with the establishment of a coniferous forest, eventually governing the turnover of fungal communities. Moreover, bacterial communities exhibited a more compact network topology during assembly, thus supporting determinism, whereas the looser clustering of fungal communities illustrated that they were determined more by stochastic processes. These pieces of evidence collectively reveal divergent successional trajectories and driving forces for soil bacterial and fungal communities along a glacier forefield chronosequence.

AB 1. Functional traits and phylogeny offer different, and often complementary, information about ecological differences between species, an essential step to uncover biodiversity assembly mechanisms and their feedbacks to ecosystem functions. However, traits and phylogeny are often related due to underlying trait evolution. Consequently, when combined, their shared information can be overemphasized, hindering their complementarity. It is therefore desirable to decouple their unique and overlapping contributions.
   2. We propose a conceptual and mathematical framework that produces a set of meaningful measures of ecological differences between species.
   3. We test the properties of these measures and the validity of the approach with extensive simulated data to show (i) the information provided by decoupling traits from phylogeny and vice versa, and (ii) that decoupling trait and phylogenetic information can uncover otherwise hidden signals underlying species coexistence and turnover. The application of the approach is further illustrated using a large dataset of Central European meadows as a case study.
   4. Decoupling traits and phylogeny particularly reveals the importance of differentiation between phylogenetically related species, which can be essential to understand species replacements along environmental gradients and the combined action of environmental filtering and limiting similarity within communities.
   5. Decoupling traits and phylogeny provides an avenue for connecting macro-evolutionary and local factors affecting coexistence and for understanding how complex species differences affect multiple ecosystem functions. We present an R function called 'decouple', which allows a simple and wide application of the framework.

AB Urbanization is a severe form of habitat fragmentation that can cause many species to be locally extirpated and many others to become trapped and isolated within an urban matrix. The role of drift in reducing genetic diversity and increasing genetic differentiation is well recognized in urban populations. However, explicit incorporation and analysis of the demographic and temporal factors promoting drift in urban environments are poorly studied. Here, we genotyped 15 microsatellites in 320 fire salamanders from the historical city of Oviedo (Est. 8th century) to assess the effects of time since isolation, demographic history (historical effective population size; N-e) and patch size on genetic diversity, population structure and contemporary N-e. Our results indicate that urban populations of fire salamanders are highly differentiated, most likely due to the recent N-e declines, as calculated in coalescence analyses, concomitant with the urban development of Oviedo. However, urbanization only caused a small loss of genetic diversity. Regression modelling showed that patch size was positively associated with contemporary N-e, while we found only moderate support for the effects of demographic history when excluding populations with unresolved history. This highlights the interplay between different factors in determining current genetic diversity and structure. Overall, the results of our study on urban populations of fire salamanders provide some of the very first insights into the mechanisms affecting changes in genetic diversity and population differentiation via drift in urban environments, a crucial subject in a world where increasing urbanization is forecasted.

AB Secondary tropical forests that are in a state of regeneration following clearing for agriculture are now more abundant than primary forests. Yet, despite their large spatial extent and important role in the global carbon (C) cycle, secondary tropical forests are understudied, which challenges our ability to predict how tropical landscapes will respond to future disturbance and global change. We summarize research advances on alterations to C and nutrient dynamics during reforestation and how these are influenced by ecosystem state factors. During forest succession, aboveground biomass stocks and litter fluxes increase in a predictable way, but patterns in soil C dynamics are highly variable. The heterogeneous response of nutrients to reforestation is influenced by multiple factors, including losses incurred during prior land use and management. In contrast to primary tropical forests, where productivity is often limited by rock-derived nutrients, secondary forest growth may be more limited by nutrients from the atmosphere. Future research should identify which nutrients constrain forest regrowth.

AB Research in reintroduction biology has provided a greater understanding of the often limited success of species reintroductions and highlighted the need for scientifically rigorous approaches in reintroduction programs. We examined the recent genetic-based captive-breeding and reintroduction literature to showcase the underuse of the genetic data gathered. We devised a framework that takes full advantage of the genetic data through assessment of the genetic makeup of populations before (past component of the framework), during (present component), and after (future component) captive-breeding and reintroduction events to understand their conservation potential and maximize their success. We empirically applied our framework to two small fishes: Yarra pygmy perch (Nannoperca obscura) and southern pygmy perch (Nannoperca australis). Each of these species has a locally adapted and geographically isolated lineage that is endemic to the highly threatened lower Murray-Darling Basin in Australia. These two populations were rescued during Australia's recent decade-long Millennium Drought, when their persistence became entirely dependent on captive-breeding and subsequent reintroduction efforts. Using historical demographic analyses, we found differences and similarities between the species in the genetic impacts of past natural and anthropogenic events that occurred in situ, such as European settlement (past component). Subsequently, successful maintenance of genetic diversity in captivitydespite skewed brooder contribution to offspringwas achieved through carefully managed genetic-based breeding (present component). Finally, genetic monitoring revealed the survival and recruitment of released captive-bred offspring in the wild (future component). Our holistic framework often requires no additional data collection to that typically gathered in genetic-based breeding programs, is applicable to a wide range of species, advances the genetic considerations of reintroduction programs, and is expected to improve with the use of next-generation sequencing technology.
   Un Marco de Referencia Holistico Novedoso para Programas de Reproduccion en Cautiverio Basada en Genetica y de Reintroduccion Investigaciones sobre biologia de la reintroduccion han proporcionado un mejor entendimiento del, a menudo, exito limitado de las reintroducciones de especies y han resaltado la necesidad de aproximaciones rigorosas cientificamente en los programas de reintroduccion. Examinamos la literatura reciente sobre reproduccion en cautiverio basada en genetica y reintroduccion para exhibir la subutilizacion de los datos geneticos. Disenamos un marco de referencia que obtiene la mayor ventaja de los datos geneticos mediante la evaluacion de la composicion genetica de las poblaciones antes (componente pasado del marco de referencia), durante (componente presente), y despues (componente futuro) de eventos de reproduccion en cautiverio y de reintroduccion para entender su potencial de conservacion y maximizar su exito. Aplicamos nuestro marco de referencia empiricamente con dos especies de peces pequenos: Nannoperca obscura y N. australis. Cada especie tiene un linaje adaptado localmente y aislado geograficamente endemico de la muy amenazada Cuenca Baja Murray-Darling, Australia. Las dos poblaciones fueron rescatadas durante la reciente Sequia del Milenio que duro diez anos en Australia, cuando su persistencia se volvio totalmente dependiente de esfuerzos de reproduccion en cautiverio y subsecuente reintroduccion. Mediante analisis demograficos historicos, encontramos diferencias y similitudes entre las especies en los impactos geneticos de eventos naturales y antropogenicos pasados que ocurrieron in situ, como el asentamiento europeo (componente pasado). Subsecuentemente, el mantenimiento exitoso de la diversidad genetica en cautiverio - no obstante la contribucion de reproductores sesgada - fue posible por el manejo cuidadoso de la reproduccion basada en genetica (componente presente). Finalmente, el monitoreo genetico revelo la supervivencia y reclutamiento de crias obtenidas en cautiverio liberadas en el medio silvestre. Nuestro marco de referencia holistico a menudo no requiere de datos adicionales a los obtenidos tipicamente en programas de reproduccion basados en genetica, es aplicable a un rango amplio de especies, es un avance en las consideraciones geneticas de los programas de reintroduccion, y mejorara con el uso de tecnologia de secuenciacion de ultima generacion.

AB Building on stakeholder theory, we propose and test an integrative model that incorporates-the relationships between a firm's orientations and sustainable supply chain practices [i.e., sustainable purchasing practices (SPPs) and sustainable supply practices (SSPs)], and interactions between the different firm orientations as related to such sustainable practices. We empirically test our hypotheses in a two-phase survey of 149 managers in the U.S. manufacturing and service industries. Our findings reveal that a firm's environmental and cultural orientations affect its SPPs and SSPs, while local community orientation' drives SPPs only in large firms. The results also suggest synergistic effects of environmental and cultural orientations on SPPs and SSPs, while societal orientation positively moderates the effect of cultural orientation on SSPs. Moreover, our findings demonstrate the moderating effect of firm business type on the relationships between cultural orientation and SPPs and SSPs. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and phosphate solubilizing Pseudomonas bacteria (PSB) could potentially interact synergistically because PSB solubilize phosphate into a form that AMF can absorb and transport to the plant. However, very little is known about the interactions between these two groups of microorganisms and how they influence the growth of each other. We tested whether different strains of bacteria, that have the capacity to solubilize phosphate, are able to grow along AMF hyphae and differentially influence the growth of AMF both outside the roots of carrot in in vitro conditions and inside the roots of potato in the presence of a microbial community. We found strong effects of AMF on the growth of the different bacterial strains. Different bacterial strains also had very strong effects on the growth of AMF extraradical hyphae outside the roots of carrot and on colonization of potato roots by AMF. The differential effects on colonization occurred in the presence of a microbial community. Our results show that these two important groups of rhizosphere microorganisms indeed interact with each other. Such interactions could potentially lead to synergistic effects between the two groups but this could depend on whether the bacteria truly solubilize phosphate in the rhizosphere in the presence of microbial communities.

AB Harvest strategy approaches based around empirical indicators and/or control rules are beginning to be accepted in a growing range of data- and capacity-poor fisheries. While there is an increasing body of work around developing empirical indicators and control rules in data-poor contexts, this has typically been done on a case-specific basis. There remains a need for general guidance on formulating control rules that link empirical indicators with suitable management responses. Additionally, in the data-poor context, most literature has focused on empirical indicators and assessments, with less focus on decision rules and the incorporation of indicators and assessments in a harvest strategy framework. This review considers a range of harvest strategy options, focusing on empirical indicators and decision rules available for data-poor species and fisheries. These clearly illustrate that a paucity of information is not a reason to avoid developing harvest strategies, and that a range of pragmatic approaches are available regardless of the available data, life-history of the target species, nature of fishing operations, or the available research capacity. There is considerable scope for further work in this field, but arguably there is a comprehensive repository of approaches and decision rules that, when combined with the guidelines, form a solid foundation and toolkit for all but the most data-poor species and fisheries.

AB By applying the concept of the coupled natural and human system (CNH), we compared spatiotemporal changes in livestock (LSK), land cover, and ecosystem production to understand the relative roles that natural and social driving forces have on CNH dynamics on the Mongolia plateau. We used socioeconomic and physical data at prefecture level for Inner Mongolia and Mongolia from 1981 through 2010 to represent changes in net primary productivity (NPP), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), precipitation, annual average temperature, LSK, livestock density (LSKD), land cover change (LCC), gross domestic production (GDP), and population (POP). The ratios such as LSK: NPP, LSKD: EVI, LSKD: albedo, LSK: POP, and LSK: GDP were examined and compared between Inner Mongolia and Mongolia, and structural equation modeling (SEM) was applied to quantify the complex interactions. Substantial differences in LSK, POP, and economic development were found among the biomes and between Inner Mongolia and Mongolia. When various indicators for policy shifts-such as the World Trade Organization (WTO) for China, the Third Campaign to Reclaim Abandoned Agriculture Lands (ATAR-3), and the Grain for Green Program for China (GFG)-were added into our SEM, the results showed significant change in the strength of the above relationships. After China joined the WTO, the relationships in Inner Mongolia between LSKD: LCC and LSKD: NPP were immensely strengthened, whereas relationships in NPP: LCC were weakened. In Mongolia, the ATAR-3 program first appeared to be an insignificant policy, but the Collapse of the Soviet Union enhanced the correlation between LSKD: LCC, weakened the connection of LCC: NPP, and did not affect LSKD: NPP. We conclude that human influences on the Mongolian CNH system exceeded those of the biophysical changes, but that the significance varies in time and per biome, as well as between Inner Mongolia and Mongolia.

AB Habitat loss and climate change pose a double jeopardy for many threatened taxa, making the identification of optimal habitat for the future a conservation priority. Using a case study of the endangered Bornean orang-utan, we identify environmental refuges by integrating bioclimatic models with projected deforestation and oil-palm agriculture suitability from the 1950s to 2080s. We coupled a maximum entropy algorithm with information on habitat needs to predict suitable habitat for the present day and 1950s. We then projected to the 2020s, 2050s and 2080s in models incorporating only land-cover change, climate change or both processes combined. For future climate, we incorporated projections from four model and emission scenario combinations. For future land cover, we developed spatial deforestation predictions from 10years of satellite data. Refuges were delineated as suitable forested habitats identified by all models that were also unsuitable for oil palm - a major threat to tropical biodiversity. Our analyses indicate that in 2010 up to 260000km(2) of Borneo was suitable habitat within the core orang-utan range; an 18-24% reduction since the 1950s. Land-cover models predicted further decline of 15-30% by the 2080s. Although habitat extent under future climate conditions varied among projections, there was majority consensus, particularly in north-eastern and western regions. Across projections habitat loss due to climate change alone averaged 63% by 2080, but 74% when also considering land-cover change. Refuge areas amounted to 2000-42000km(2) depending on thresholds used, with 900-17000km(2) outside the current species range. We demonstrate that efforts to halt deforestation could mediate some orang-utan habitat loss, but further decline of the most suitable areas is to be expected given projected changes to climate. Protected refuge areas could therefore become increasingly important for ongoing translocation efforts. We present an approach to help identify such areas for highly threatened species given environmental changes expected this century.

AB Alternative stable-state theory (ASS) is widely accepted as explaining landscape-level vegetation dynamics, such as switches between forest and grassland. This theory argues that webs of feedbacks stabilise vegetation composition and structure, and that abrupt state shifts can occur if stabilising feedbacks are weakened. However, it is difficult to identify stabilising feedback loops and the disturbance thresholds beyond which state changes occur. Here, we argue that doing this requires a synthetic approach blending observation, experimentation, simulation, conceptual models, and narratives. Using forest boundaries and large mammal extinctions, we illustrate how a multifaceted research program can advance understanding of feedback-driven ecosystem change. Our integrative approach has applicability to other complex macroecological systems controlled by numerous feedbacks where controlled experimentation is impossible.

AB Detailed land-cover mapping is essential for a range of research issues addressed by the sustainability and land system sciences and planning. This study uses an object-based approach to create a 1 m land-cover classification map of the expansive Phoenix metropolitan area through the use of high spatial resolution aerial photography from National Agricultural Imagery Program. It employs an expert knowledge decision rule set and incorporates the cadastral GIS vector layer as auxiliary data. The classification rule was established on a hierarchical image object network, and the properties of parcels in the vector layer were used to establish land cover types. Image segmentations were initially utilized to separate the aerial photos into parcel sized objects, and were further used for detailed land type identification within the parcels. Characteristics of image objects from contextual and geometrical aspects were used in the decision rule set to reduce the spectral limitation of the four-band aerial photography. Classification results include 12 land-cover classes and subclasses that may be assessed from the sub-parcel to the landscape scales, facilitating examination of scale dynamics. The proposed object-based classification method provides robust results, uses minimal and readily available ancillary data, and reduces computational time. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Discordance among individual molecular age estimates, or between molecular age estimates and the fossil record, is observed in many clades across the Tree of Life. This discordance is attributed to a variety of variables including calibration age uncertainty, calibration placement, nucleotide substitution rate heterogeneity, or the specified molecular clock model. However, the impact of changes in phylogenetic informativeness of individual genes over time on phylogenetic inferences is rarely analyzed. Using nuclear and mitochondrial sequence data for ray-finned fishes (Actinopterygii) as an example, we extend the utility of phylogenetic informativeness profiles to predict the time intervals when nucleotide substitution saturation results in discordance among molecular ages estimated.
   Results: We demonstrate that even with identical calibration regimes and molecular clock methods, mitochondrial based molecular age estimates are systematically older than those estimated from nuclear sequences. This discordance is most severe for highly nested nodes corresponding to more recent (i.e., Jurassic-Recent) divergences. By removing data deemed saturated, we reconcile the competing age estimates and highlight that the older mtDNA based ages were driven by nucleotide saturation.
   Conclusions: Homoplasious site patterns in a DNA sequence alignment can systematically bias molecular divergence time estimates. Our study demonstrates that PI profiles can provide a non-arbitrary criterion for data exclusion to mitigate the influence of homoplasy on time calibrated branch length estimates. Analyses of actinopterygian molecular clocks demonstrate that scrutiny of the time scale on which sequence data is informative is a fundamental, but generally overlooked, step in molecular divergence time estimation.

AB Species distribution models are increasingly applied to freshwater ecosystems. Most applications use large scales, coarse resolutions and anthropocentric modelling extents, thus not being able to consider important environmental predictors and ecological processes detectable within a catchment and at finer scales. Moreover, high resolution predictions of species distribution in streams can help improve our understanding of how environmental variables within a catchment affect the distribution of stream macroinvertebrates. We built models at a resolution of 25 m x 25 m for a 488 km(2) catchment in northern Germany to determine whether the spatial approach in which environmental predictors are implemented in the model affects the overall performance. We used predictors from four different categories relevant to freshwater ecosystems: bioclimatic, topographic, hydrologic and land use. Two spatial approaches were tested: a local one, or grid based and a cumulative for the upstream area, or subcatchment specific. Models were evaluated in terms of model performance and accuracy in order to identify the approach best suited for each category, as well as the most important predictor in each. In the case of the land use category, the subcatchment approach made a significant difference, increasing performance. A final model, calibrated with the selected predictors, resulted in the highest model performance and accuracy. Our results indicate that species distribution models perform well and are accurate at high resolutions, within small catchments. We conclude that catchment wide models, especially when using predictors from multiple categories, have the potential to significantly improve modelling framework of species distribution in freshwater ecosystems. The information produced by accurate, small scale, species distribution models can guide managers and conservation practitioners, by predicting the effects of management decisions within a catchment. We suggest that highly resolved predictors be applied in models using the catchment approach. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The Amazon Basin harbors one of the richest biotas on Earth, such that a number of diversification hypotheses have been formulated to explain patterns of Amazonian biodiversity and biogeography. For nearly two decades, phylogeographic approaches have been applied to better understand the underlying causes of genetic differentiation and geographic structure among Amazonian organisms. Although this research program has made progress in elucidating several aspects of species diversification in the region, recent methodological and theoretical developments in the discipline of phylogeography will provide new perspectives through more robust hypothesis testing. Herein, we outline central aspects of Amazonian geology and landscape evolution as well as climate and vegetation dynamics through the Neogene and Quaternary to contextualize the historical settings considered by major hypotheses of diversification. We address each of these hypotheses by reviewing key phylogeographic papers and by expanding their respective predictions. We also propose future directions for devising and testing hypotheses. Specifically, combining the exploratory power of phylogeography with the statistical rigor of coalescent methods will greatly expand analytical inferences on the evolutionary history of Amazonian biota. Incorporation of non-genetic data from Earth science disciplines into the phylogeographic approach is key to a better understanding of the influence of climatic and geophysical events on patterns of Amazonian biodiversity and biogeography. In addition, achieving such an integrative enterprise must involve overcoming issues such as limited geographic and taxonomic sampling. These future challenges likely will be accomplished by a combination of extensive collaborative research and incentives for conducting basic inventories.

AB Ecosystem services are the benefits that mankind obtains from natural ecosystems. Here we identify the key services provided by the Southern Ocean. These include provisioning of fishery products, nutrient cycling, climate regulation and the maintenance of biodiversity, with associated cultural and aesthetic benefits. Potential catch limits for Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba Dana) alone are equivalent to 11% of current global marine fisheries landings. We also examine the extent to which decision-making within the Antarctic Treaty System (ATS) considers trade-offs between ecosystem services, using the management of the Antarctic krill fishery as a case study. Management of this fishery considers a three-way trade-off between fisheries performance, the status of the krill stock and that of predator populations. However, there is a paucity of information on how well these components represent other ecosystem services that might be degraded as a result of fishing. There is also a lack of information on how beneficiaries value these ecosystem services. A formal ecosystem assessment would help to address these knowledge gaps. It could also help to harmonize decision-making across the ATS and promote global recognition of Southern Ocean ecosystem services by providing a standard inventory of the relevant ecosystem services and their value to beneficiaries.

AB Reduced representation genome sequencing such as restriction-site-associated DNA (RAD) sequencing is finding increased use to identify and genotype large numbers of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in model and nonmodel species. We generated a unique resource of novel SNP markers for the European eel using the RAD sequencing approach that was simultaneously identified and scored in a genome-wide scan of 30 individuals. Whereas genomic resources are increasingly becoming available for this species, including the recent release of a draft genome, no genome-wide set of SNP markers was available until now. The generated SNPs were widely distributed across the eel genome, aligning to 4779 different contigs and 19703 different scaffolds. Significant variation was identified, with an average nucleotide diversity of 0.00529 across individuals. Results varied widely across the genome, ranging from 0.00048 to 0.00737 per locus. Based on the average nucleotide diversity across all loci, long-term effective population size was estimated to range between 132000 and 1320000, which is much higher than previous estimates based on microsatellite loci. The generated SNP resource consisting of 82425 loci and 376918 associated SNPs provides a valuable tool for future population genetics and genomics studies and allows for targeting specific genes and particularly interesting regions of the eel genome.

AB The bluespotted cornetfish (Fistularia commersonii) (Osteichtyes, Fistulariidae) is considered to be one of the most invasive species of the Mediterranean Sea and Europe but only scattered information exists on its distribution and abundance. Here we collated the available species records, following its first detection in the Mediterranean Sea, in January 2000, until October 2011. A total of 191 observations were used to reconstruct the invasion sequence, to provide estimates of the rate of spread and to construct an environmental suitability model based on six biophysical variables and the maximum entropy approach. The results showed that colonization of the Mediterranean Sea proceeded in parallel along the southern and northern rim of the Basin at speeds that reached 1,000-1,500 km year(-1) with a clear decrease in the rate of spread at the Sicily Strait. The most important explanatory variables for describing the distribution of F. commersonii were mean depth (explaining 32.4 % of the data variance), chlorophyll-a (29.3 %), and salinity (18.4 %). Coastal areas with relatively low chlorophyll-a concentrations and high salinity were the preferred habitat of the bluespotted cornetfish in its invaded range. Conversely, extreme productivity (highly eutrophic or highly oligotrophic), low salinity and cold temperatures provided abiotic resistance to this invasion. Areas of high environmental suitability were identified along the northern coasts of the Levantine Sea, Dodecanese, Sicily Strait and Tyrrhenian Sea. In contrast, the north Aegean Sea, the Adriatic and the Alboran Sea, the Nile Delta, the western coasts of Egypt and Cyrenaica were unfavourable for the invasion. Despite some limits due to the model's resolution scale, these general predictions provide new insights into the F. commersonii invasion, indicating abiotic factors of primary importance in shaping the distribution of this species in its invaded range.

AB Newly developed non-destructive fluorescence-based indices were used to evaluate nitrogen (N) fertilization rates and leaf nitrogen content in Paspalum vaginatum and Zoysia matrella turfgrasses. They were defined by combinations of the red (RF) and far-red (FRF) chlorophyll fluorescence signals excited under ultraviolet (UV), green (G) or red (R) radiation, as follow: Flavonol index, FLAV = log(FRFR/FRFUV); Chlorophyll indices, CHL = FRFR/RFR and CHL1 = FRFG/FRFR; Nitrogen Balance Indices, NBI = FRFUV/RFR and NBI1 = FRFG.FRFUV/FRFR2. Measurements were performed in situ by using a portable optical sensor able to scan 1 m(2) plots, with a 0.2m resolution, under 6 different nitrogen rates, from 0 to 250 kg ha(-1), with four replicates each. From the same plots, reflectance spectra were recorded and several reflectance-based indices calculated. Most of them, as well as the fluorescence-based indices of chlorophyll, CHL and CHL1, had a quadratic response to N rate with a flattening above 150 kg ha(-1) and 100 kg ha(-1) for P. vaginatum and Z. matrella, respectively. The fluorescence-based NBI1 index was the only one able to discriminate all the 6 N levels applied to both P. vaginatum and Z. matrelta plots. This result is due to the character of NBI1 as a ratio between an index of chlorophyll and an index of flavonols that present opposite responses to N rates. The spatial heterogeneity within and between plots treated with different levels of N was well represented by the map of the NBI indices. When the NBI1 and NBI were regressed against leaf N content linear fits were obtained with high regression coefficients in both P. vaginatum (R-2 = 0.85-0.87, RMSE = 0.23-0.24% N) and Z. matrella (R-2 = 0.75-0.78, RMSE = 0.20-0.22% N). The best relationships between leaf N content and reflectance-based indices, found for R-730/R-1000 (R-2 = 0.71, RMSE = 0.43% N) and MCARI (R-2 = 0.80, RMSE = 0.22% N) for P. vaginatum and Z. matrella, respectively, were curvilinear and, therefore, less effective than NBI indices in the estimation of N. Nevertheless, a reflectance vegetation index suitable as proxy of leaf N common to both turf species was not found. Our results indicate the high potential of the fluorescence-based method and sensors for the in situ proximal sensing of N status in the management of N fertilization in turfgrass.

AB The lower reaches of the expansive Murray-Darling Basin, Australia, are a hotspot for freshwater biodiversity. The regional ecosystem, however, has been significantly altered by river regulation, including local and catchment-wide water abstraction. Freshwater fishes have suffered from the resultant altered flow regime, together with other threats including habitat degradation and alien species. Impacts reached a critical point (imminent species extinction) during a prolonged drought (1997-2010) that lead to broad-scale habitat loss and drying of refuges during 2007-2010, and urgent conservation measures were subsequently instigated for five threatened small-bodied fish species. A critical response phase included ad hoc interventions that were later incorporated within a broader, coordinated multi-agency program (i.e. the Drought Action Plan and Critical Fish Habitat projects). On-ground actions included local translocation, alien species control, in situ habitat maintenance (e.g. earthworks, environmental water delivery), fish rescues, artificial refuge establishment and captive breeding. Improved river flows signalled an initial phase of recovery in 2011-2012 that included reintroductions. The present paper aims to document the actions undertaken in the Lower Murray, and review successes and lessons from practical examples that will help guide and inform management responses to conserve fish in modified systems subjected to severe water decline.

AB 1. One of the primary goals in community ecology is to determine the relative importance of processes and mechanisms that control biodiversity. Here, we examined habitat-driven species assemblages and species distribution patterns as well as their temporal variations for three life stages of two censuses of a 25-ha mixed dipterocarp forest at Sinharaja (Sri Lanka).
   2. Our general objective was to find out whether the species assemblages and associated habitat types changed with life stage, spatial scale and species attributes. We also analyse whether the habitat types were related to certain indicator species. Habitat types were determined with multivariate regression tree analyses driven by topographic variables.
   3. We found species assemblages associated with five distinct habitat types that appeared consistently for all life stages of the two censuses. These habitats were related to ridge-valley gradients and a pronounced contrast in south-west versus north-east aspect. Habitat-driven structuring was weak at the recruit stage but strong in the juvenile and adult stages. The species assemblage variance explained by topographic variables for different life stages ranged between 10% for recruits and 23% for juveniles.
   4. The species assemblages determined for different spatial scales (10, 20, 50 m) showed similar habitat partitioning, but the variance explained by the topographic variables increased in all life stages with spatial scale. This could be due to the homogenizing effect of topographic variables at the larger scales and unaccounted environmental variation at the smaller scales. The number of indicator species identified in the two censuses was higher in the juvenile stage than in the adult stage, and nearly all indicator species in the adult stage were also indicator species in the juvenile stage.
   5. Synthesis. Our study showed that approximately 75% of the variance in local species composition is unexplained. This may be due to spatially structured processes such as dispersal limitation, unaccounted biotic and abiotic environmental variables, and stochastic effects, but only 25% were due to topographic habitat association. Although the pronounced ridge-valley gradient and contrast of south-west versus north-east aspect created consistent habitats, our results suggest that local species assemblages at Sinharaja forest are jointly shaped by neutral and niche processes.

AB One of the most promising recent advances in biogeography has been the increased interest and understanding of species distribution models estimates of the probability that a species is present given environmental data. Unfortunately, such analyses ignore many aspects of ecology, and so are difficult to interpret. In particular, we know that species interactions have a profound influence on distributions, but it is not usually possible to incorporate this knowledge into species distribution models. What is needed is a rigorous understanding of how unmeasured biotic interactions affect the inferences generated by species distribution models. To fill this gap, we develop a general mathematical approach that uses probability theory to determine how unmeasured biotic interactions affect inferences from species distribution models. Using this approach, we reanalyze one of the most important classes of mechanistic models of competition: models of consumer resource dynamics. We determine how measurements of one aspect of the environment a single environmental variable can be used to estimate the probability that an environment is suitable with species distribution models. We show that species distribution models, which ignore numerous facets of consumer resource dynamics such as the presence of a competitor or the dynamics of depletable resources, can furnish useful predictions for the probability that an environment is suitable in some circumstances. These results provide a rigorous link between complex mechanistic models of species interactions and species distribution models. In so doing they demonstrate that unmeasured biotic interactions can have strong and counterintuitive consequences on species distribution models.

AB Understanding the distribution of gas exchange within a plant is a prerequisite for scaling up from leaves to canopies. We evaluated whether leaf traits were reliable predictors of the effects of leaf ageing and leaf irradiance on leaf photosynthetic capacity (Vcmax, Jmax) in field-grown vines (Vitis vinifera L). Simultaneously, we measured gas exchange, leaf mass per area (LMA) and nitrogen content (Nm) of leaves at different positions within the canopy and at different phenological stages. Daily mean leaf irradiance cumulated over 10 d (PPFD10) was obtained by 3D modelling of the canopy structure. Nm decreased over the season in parallel to leaf ageing while LMA was mainly affected by leaf position. PPFD10 explained 66, 28 and 73% of the variation of LMA, Nm and nitrogen content per area (Na), respectively. Nitrogen content per unit area (Na = LMA X Nm) was the best predictor of the intra-canopy variability of leaf photosynthetic capacity. Finally, we developed a classical photosynthesis-stomatal conductance submodel and by introducing Na as an input, the model accurately simulated the daily pattern of gas exchange for leaves at different positions in the canopy and at different phenological stages during the season.

AB Restoration of degraded land has been identified as a top research priority in conservation. Fauna plays a critical role in the re-establishment of a functional ecosystem, yet fauna recolonization of restored areas is less studied than flora. We reviewed the findings of 71 publications on fauna recolonization, through the example of mining rehabilitation in the Australian continent, a global stronghold of large-scale mining.
   Species densities and richness were frequently lower in rehabilitated compared to undisturbed areas, even more so when only native species were considered. Amongst all criteria used to measure success, recovery of the pre-mining fauna community composition was the hardest to achieve. Introduced species were often found in rehabilitated areas but further research is needed to determine the duration of this association. Meta-analyses of the factors influencing mining rehabilitation success for fauna revealed that fauna groups recolonized heterogeneously. Recolonization was dependent on the methods used to rehabilitate and the number of years since rehabilitation. Notably, methods combining the use of fresh topsoil with the addition of seeds and seedlings were most successful for fauna recolonization, both in term of fauna density and richness.
   Limitations to this review included strong biases toward certain mining companies, as well as missing data, which decreased the power of meta-analysis. Available publications did not evenly represent all fauna taxa and studies were short when compared to the time needed to re-construct whole ecosystems. We consider the development of comprehensive fauna standards for assessing rehabilitation success critical. This could be the next challenge in restoration ecology. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

There is evidence that entire avian assemblages in open woodlands can be influenced strongly by individual species over very large areas in eastern Australia, with small-bodied species (<50 g) being adversely affected. We used data from repeated surveys in 371 sites in seven districts across a region from Victoria to Queensland (>2000 km). A series of linked Bayesian models was used to identify large-bodied (>= 50 g) bird species that were associated with changes in occurrence and abundance of small-bodied species. One native species, the Noisy Miner (Manorina melanocephala; family Meliphagidae), was objectively identified as the sole large-bodied species having similar detrimental effects in all districts, depressing occurrence of 57 of 71 small-bodied species. Adverse effects on abundances of small-bodied species were profound when the Noisy Miner occurred with mean site abundances >= 1.6 birds/2 ha. The Noisy Miner may be the first species to have been shown to influence whole-of-avifauna assemblage structure through despotic aggressiveness over subcontinental scales. These substantial shifts in occurrence rates and abundances of small-bodied species flow on to alter species abundance distributions of entire assemblages over much of eastern Australia.

AB The importance of soil organic matter (SOM) in the global carbon (C) cycle has been highlighted by many studies, but the way in which SOM stabilization processes and chemical composition affect decomposition rates under natural climatic conditions is not yet well understood. To relate the temperature sensitivity of heterotrophic soil respiration to the decomposition potential of SOM, we compared temperature sensitivities of respiration rates from a 2-year long soil translocation experiment from four elevations along a similar to 3000 m tropical forest gradient. We determined SOM stabilization mechanisms and the molecular structure of soil C from different horizons collected before and after the translocation. Soil samples were analysed by physical fractionation procedures, C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The temperature sensitivity (Q (10)) of heterotrophic soil respiration at the four sites along the elevation transect did not correlate with either the available amount of SOM or its chemical structure. Only the relative distribution of C into physical soil fractions correlated with Q (10) values. We therefore conclude that physical fractionation of soil samples is the most appropriate way to assess the temperature sensitivity of SOM.

AB Hillslope hydrological dynamics, particularly subsurface flow (SSF), are highly variable and complex. A profound understanding of factors controlling this variability is needed. Therefore we investigated the relationship between variability of shallow water table dynamics and various hillslope characteristics. We ask whether measurable hillslope properties explain patterns of subsurface flow variability. To approach this question, shallow water table dynamics of three adjacent large-scale hillslopes were monitored with high spatial and temporal resolution over 18 months. The hillslopes are similar in terms of topography and parent material, but different in vegetation cover (grassland, coniferous forest, and mixed forest). We expect vegetation to be an important driver of water table dynamics at our study site, especially given the minor differences in topography. Various hillslope properties were determined in the field and via GIS analysis: common topography descriptors, well depth, soil properties via slug tests, and several vegetation parameters. Response variables characterizing the water table response per well were calculated for different temporal scales (entire time series, seasonal scale, event scale). Partial correlation analysis and a Random Forest machine learning approach were carried out to assess the explainability of SSF variability by measurable hillslope characteristics. We found a complex interplay of predictors, yet soil properties and topography showed the highest single explanatory power. Surprisingly, vegetation characteristics played a minor role. Solely throughfall and canopy cover exerted a slightly stronger control, especially in summer. Most importantly, the examined hillslope characteristics explained only a small proportion of the observed SSF variability. Consequently there must be additional important drivers not represented by current measurement techniques of the hillslope configuration (e. g. bedrock properties, preferential pathways). We also found interesting differences in explainability of SSF variability among temporal scales and between both forested hillslopes and the grassland hillslope.

AB Species distribution models (SDMs) are an important tool in biogeography and ecology and are widely used for both fundamental and applied research purposes. SDMs require spatially explicit information about species occurrence and environmental covariates to produce a set of rules that identify and scale the environmental space where the species was observed and that can further be used to predict the suitability of a site for the species. More spatially accurate data are increasingly available, and the number of publications on the influence of spatial inaccuracies on the performance of modelling procedures is growing exponentially. Three main sources of uncertainty are associated with the three elements of a predictive function: the dependent variable, the explanatory variables and the algorithm or function used to relate these two variables. In this study, we review how spatial uncertainties influence model accuracy and we propose some methodological issues in the application of SDMs with regard to the modelling of fundamental and realized niches of species. We distinguish two cases suitable for different types of spatial data accuracy. For modelling the realized distribution of a species, particularly for management and conservation purposes, we suggest using only accurate species occurrence data and large sample sizes. Appropriate data filtering and examination of the spatial autocorrelation in predictors should be a routine procedure to minimize the possible influence of positional uncertainty in species occurrence data. However, if the data are sparse, models of the potential distribution of species can be created using a relatively small sample size, and this can provide a generalized indication of the main regional drivers of the distribution patterns. By this means, field surveys can be targeted to discover unknown populations and species in poorly surveyed regions in order to improve the robustness of the data for later modelling of the realized distributions. Based on this review, we conclude that (1) with data that are currently available, studies performed at a resolution of 1-100 km(2) are useful for hypothesizing about the environmental conditions that limit the distribution of a species and (2) incorporating coarse resolution species occurrence data in a model, despite an increase in sample size, lowers model performance.

AB Long-term, fisheries-independent bag seine surveys conducted in TX, USA estuaries from 1977 to 2009 were used to develop a spatio-temporal species-environment model for juvenile spotted seatrout. Cynoscion nebulous. Relationships between environmental predictors and juvenile spotted seatrout distribution were investigated using boosted regression trees (BRTs). Results showed good model performance and suggested that, in relation to environmental factors, juvenile spotted seatrout distribution is most closely linked to salinity, temperature, and distance from tidal inlets. There was also a strong seasonal pattern where abundance increased from May to October and declined precipitously after November. Juveniles were rarely captured between January and April. By interpolating the environmental predictors, monthly maps of the probability of capture were produced using ordinary kriging. Spatial patterns were also evident. Probability of occurrence began increasing first in Upper Laguna Madre peaking in Baffin Bay. Probability of occurrence was consistently higher in this region than other regions within the study area. Predicted occurrence was also high in portions of Corpus Christi, Aransas, San Antonio Bays, and the southern portion of Galveston Bay. Overall, probability of occurrence increased with increasing distance from tidal inlets. The development of spatially explicit models allows for prioritization and conservation of areas in a region that has great potential for human disturbance and climate change impacts.

AB As a key contribution to Canada's Ecosystem Status and Trends (ESTR) national assessment, the goal of our study was to utilize available flow data as a surrogate of habitat suitability for aquatic ecological communities, and examine temporal trends in hydroecological variables over the 1970-2005 period. Daily flow data were extracted from the Reference Hydrological Basin Network, and an agglomerative hierarchical classification method was used to identify homogenous regions with similar seasonality of the flow regime. Six regime regions were identified reflecting the timing of the annual peaks and low flows in addition to the patterns in the rising and falling limbs. For each of the gauging station sites, the magnitude, duration, timing, frequency, and rate of change of annual hydrological events were quantified through 32 ecologically important hydrological variables. Long-term patterns in the hydroecological variables were quantified using the nonparametric Mann-Kendall trend statistic. The results revealed more trends than would be expected to occur by chance for most variables. Clear regional trend patterns were observed within individual regime groups demonstrating the often differing response to environmental variability within the different regions. Results at the national scale were highly variable, but trends towards increased variability in river flows were observed with a predominant increasing trend in the number of flow reversals over the water year and decreasing trend in the annual low-flow indices. The identified river regime regions offer an initial framework for scientific investigation of hydroecological patterns and an opportunity to move towards a more predictive approach to environmental flows assessment in sustainable resource management and planning.

AB This study demonstrated that the Standardised Flow Index (SFI) was a simple and useful tool to research, monitor and manage hydrologic drought in a highly regulated river system, the Murrumbidgee River in southeast Australia. To validate the applicability of the theory underlining the widely used Standardised Precipitation Index (SPI) to river discharge data, we investigated the probability distribution of the time series of monthly river discharge month by month using long-term (over 100 years) river flow records. Our results showed that the Gamma probability distribution function was adequate to describe and model the skewed river flow data. The generalised additive models (GAM) with Locally Estimated Scattersplot Smoothing (LOESS) additive terms were applied to the computed SFI and SPI sequences to investigate the impacts of river regulation and water diversion on the duration and magnitude of hydrologic droughts in Lower Murrumbidgee River from 1890. The results revealed that upstream regulations had successfully reduced the drought severity at Wagga Wagga, a weir located downstream of the two major dams but immediately upstream of the major irrigation areas. However, the hydrological benefits of river regulation gradually disappeared as the river travels downstream and more and more water abstracted. At Balranald, the end valley weir, hydrologic drought was progressively aggravated during the modelling period, and the impacts were greater during drier periods. The results of the study highlighted the importance of balancing the needs between upstream and downstream water users in river management. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In recent years, a variety of modelling approaches have been developed and applied to predict site index from a wide range of environmental variables, with varying success. The selection, application and comparison of suitable modelling techniques remains therefore a meticulous task, subject to ongoing research and debate.
   In this study, the performance of five modelling techniques was compared for the prediction of forest site index in two contrasting ecoregions: the temperate lowland of Flanders, Belgium, and the Mediterranean mountains in SW Turkey. The modelling techniques include statistical (multiple linear regression - MLR, classification and regression trees - CART, generalized additive models - GAM), as well as machine-learning (artificial neural networks - ANN) and hybrid techniques (boosted regression trees - BRT). Although the selected predictor variables differed largely, with mainly topographic predictor variables in the mountain area versus soil and humus variables in the lowland area, the techniques performed comparatively similar in both ecoregions.
   Stochastic multicriteria acceptability analysis (SMAA) was found a well-suited multicriteria evaluation method to evaluate the performance of the modelling techniques. It has been applied on the individual species models of Flanders, as well as a species-independent evaluation, combining all developed models from the two contrasting ecoregions. We came to the conclusion that non-parametric models are better suited for predicting site index than traditional MLR. GAM and BRT are the preferred alternatives for a wide range of weight preferences. CART is preferred when very high weight is given to user-friendliness, whereas ANN is recommended when most weight is given to pure predictive performance. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB One of the most significant biological impacts of global climate change is through alterations of organismal body temperature, which ultimately drives almost all physiological processes. Using a simple heat budget model ground-truthed using similar to 5 years of in situ temperature data collected using biomimetic sensors, we explored the sensitivity of aerial (low tide) mussel body temperature at three tidal elevations to changes in air temperature, solar radiation, wind speed, wave height, and the timing of low tide at a site in central California, USA (Bodega Bay). Results suggest that while increases in air temperature and solar radiation can significantly alter the risk of exposure to stressful conditions, especially at upper intertidal elevations, patterns of risk can be substantially reduced by convective cooling such that even moderate increases in mean wind speed (similar to 1 m s(-1)) can theoretically counteract the effects of substantial (2.5 degrees C) increases in air temperature. Simulations further suggest that shifts in the timing of low tide (+1 h), such as occur moving to different locations along the coast of California, can have very large impacts on sensitivity to increases in air temperature. Depending on the timing of low tide, at some sites increases in air temperature will primarily affect animals in the upper intertidal zone, while at other sites animals will be affected across all tidal elevations. Field measurements and model predictions show that animal temperatures are often high even when air temperatures are not, confirming the importance of solar radiation in the heat budgets of intertidal ectotherms. Conversely, body temperatures are not always elevated even when low tide air temperatures are extreme due to the combined effects of convective cooling and wave splash. The results of these simulations. coupled with ongoing field measurements, suggest that the timing and magnitude of warming will be highly variable at coastal sites, and can be driven to a large extent by local oceanographic and meteorological processes. Moreover, they strongly caution against the use of single environmental metrics such as air temperature as indicators of past, current and future physiological stress on the west coast of North America, and instead advocate for approaches that consider the interactive roles of multiple physical drivers.

AB The economic valuation of ecosystem services is a key policy tool in stemming losses of biological diversity. It is proposed that the loss of ecosystem function and the biological resources within ecosystems is due in part to the failure of markets to recognize the benefits humans derive from ecosystems. Placing monetary values on ecosystem services is often suggested as a necessary step in correcting such market failures. We consider the effects of valuing different types of ecosystem services within an economic framework. We argue that provisioning and regulating ecosystem services are generally produced and consumed in ways that make them amenable to economic valuation. The values associated with cultural ecosystem services lie outside the domain of economic valuation, but their worth may be expressed through noneconomic, deliberative forms of valuation. We argue that supporting ecosystem services are not of direct value and that the losses of such services can be expressed in terms of the effects of their loss on the risk to the provision of the directly valued ecosystem services they support. We propose a heuristic framework that considers the relations between ecological risks and returns in the provision of ecosystem services. The proposed ecosystem-service valuation framework, which allows the expression of the value of all types of ecosystem services, calls for a shift from static, purely monetary valuation toward the consideration of trade-offs between the current flow of benefits from ecosystems and the ability of those ecosystems to provide future flows.

AB Recent studies highlight an increase in the frequency and intensity of marine mass mortalities of several species over the past 30-40 years, mainly in tropical and temperate areas. In the Mediterranean Sea these episodes particularly affect benthic suspension feeders, such as sponges and cnidarians. The main objective of this work was to document the loss of one of the main Mediterranean seascapes, Paramuricea clavata forests at the Marine Protected Area of Tavolara Punta Coda Cavallo, Sardinia (Italy), during the summer of 2008. Data regarding colony height, density, level of damage, and microbiological community were collected at two sites. Such parameters help us understand how mass mortality mechanisms act on this ecosystem engineer. We identified a change in size class distribution following a mass mortality that leaves mainly small colonies with a decrease in habitat complexity. Several tests on water chemistry demonstrate that the mortality event was not caused by local contamination. Moreover, microbiological tests on potential pathogenic agents suggest that bacteria belonging to the genus Vibrio are present as an opportunistic and not an etiological cause of P. clavata mortality events. Possible restoration approaches are discussed.

AB Reduced streamflow via flow diversion has the potential to limit the sediment-transport capacity of downstream channels and lead to accumulation of fine sediments and habitat degradation. To investigate, we examined the effects of variable levels of flow diversion on fine-sediment deposition, hydraulic conditions and geomorphic alteration. Our study consisted of a detailed field analysis pairing reaches above and below diversion dams on 13 mountain streams in north-central Colorado and southern Wyoming USA. Diversions are ubiquitous across the American West, yet previous comparative studies on the effects of flow diversion have yielded mixed results. Through application of strict site-selection criteria, multiple fine-sediment measures, and an intensive sampling scheme, this study found that channels downstream of diversions contained significantly more fine sediment and slow-flowing habitat as compared to upstream control reaches. Susceptibility to fine-sediment accumulation was associated with decreasing basin size, decreasing bankfull depth and smaller d(84), and it appears to be magnified in streams of less than 3% slope.

AB Climate change is expected to negatively impact many freshwater environments due to reductions in stream-flow and increases in temperature. These conditions, however, can already be found today in areas experiencing significant drought; current observations of species' responses to droughts can be used to make predictions about their future responses to climate change. Using otolith analysis, we recreated golden perch (Macquaria ambigua) growth chronologies from two temperate lake populations in southeastern Australia over a 15-year period pre- and during a supraseasonal drought. We related interannual growth variation to landscape-scale changes in temperature and hydrological regimes: fish growth declined as water levels in the lakes dropped during the drought, but this effect was offset by increased growth in warmer years. We hypothesize that golden perch are responding to fluctuations in food availability and intraspecific competition related to water level and to an optimization of physiological growth conditions related to increases in growing season length. Based on our analyses, we made predictions of future growth under a number of climate change scenarios that incorporate forecast deviations in stream-flows and air temperature. Despite climatic models predicting significant declines in future water availability, fish growth may increase due to a disproportionate lengthening of the growing season. As the two lakes are at the limit of the southerly range of golden perch, our results are consistent with previous findings of climate-change driven latitudinal range shifts in a poleward direction. We discuss assumptions concerning the constancy of ecological interactions into the future that warrant further study. Our research provides a novel application of biochronological analysis that could be used elsewhere to further our knowledge of species responses to changing environments.

AB Aim
   We consider three questions. (1) How different are the predicted distribution maps when climate-only and climate-plus-terrain models are developed from high-resolution data? (2) What are the implications of differences between the models when predicting future distributions under climate change scenarios, particularly for climate-only models at coarse resolution? (3) Does the use of high-resolution data and climate-plus-terrain models predict an increase in the number of local refugia?
   Location
   South-eastern New South Wales, Australia.
   Methods
   We developed two species distribution models for Eucalyptus fastigata under current climate conditions using generalized additive modelling. One used only climate variables as predictors (mean annual temperature, mean annual rainfall, mean summer rainfall); the other used both climate and landscape (June daily radiation, topographic position, lithology, nutrients) variables as predictors. Predictions of the distribution under current climate and climate change were then made for both models at a pixel resolution of 100 m.
   Results
   The model using climate and landscape variables as predictors explained a significantly greater proportion of the deviance than the climate-only model. Inclusion of landscape variables resulted in the prediction of much larger areas of existing optimal habitat. An overlay of predicted future climate on the current climate space indicated that extrapolation of the statistical models was not occurring and models were therefore more robust. Under climate change, landscape-defined refugia persisted in areas where the climate-only model predicted major declines. In areas where expansion was predicted, the increase in optimal habitat was always greater with landscape predictors. Recognition of extensive optimal habitat conditions and potential refugia was dependent on the use of high-resolution landscape data.
   Main conclusions
   Using only climate variables as predictors for assessing species responses to climate change ignores the accepted conceptual model of plant species distribution. Explicit statements justifying the selection of predictors based on ecological principles are needed. Models using only climate variables overestimate range reduction under climate change and fail to predict potential refugia. Fine-scale-resolution data are required to capture important climate/landscape interactions. Extrapolation of statistical models to regions in climate space outside the region where they were fitted is risky.

AB P>1. Biological invasions represent a major threat to human health, ecosystem functioning and global biodiversity. Insect pests affecting agriculture and forestry are of special importance. Estimations of climatic similarity between a species' native range and potential zones of invasion can be useful for preventing new invasions, spreads and ulterior contacts among populations from multiple invasions.
   2. We estimated areas climatically favourable for the establishment of the western corn rootworm (WCR), an insect pest of maize Zea mays in North America that has recently invaded Central Europe through multiple invasions, and it has the potential of invasion mainly in the Northern Hemisphere.
   3. We used complementary techniques to assess the biological relevance of predictors and obtain areas of climatic favourability. The biological relevance of variables was first assessed accounting for two main components of the WCR's environmental niche (marginality and specialisation). Then, the most relevant predictors were used to obtain either climatic envelopes or environmental distances regarding the WCR's native range. Model outputs and predictor relevance were independently assessed in the currently invaded region of Europe and through the spatial projection of proposed physiological thresholds from previous empirical studies. Lastly, as examples of application for given time periods, we fed back results of environmental distances with maize data for a 10-year period in Europe, and refined global risk maps with the main maize zones for the year 2000.
   4. We present global zones of climatic favourability and invasion risk for the WCR, with emphasis on the Northern Hemisphere. The northern and north-west range limits predicted by the climatic envelope in the WCR's native range mirrored the independently characterised physiological limits. Also, our model outputs explained some of the patterns observed in Europe supporting the validity of our procedures.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Assessments of climatic favourability for the western corn rootworm can provide information on areas of invasion risk. Our study highlights the combination of holistic and reductionist approaches as a useful protocol to evaluate models and/or infer causality. Our methodology can be an efficient tool in combating future potential invasions, spreads and secondary contact zones of insect pests by reducing uncertainty regarding where to allocate prevention and/or eradication efforts.

AB Current global models predict a hotter and drier climate in the southwestern United States with anticipated increases in drought frequency and severity coupled with changes in flash flood regimes. Such changes would likely have important ecological consequences, particularly for stream and riparian ecosystems already subject to frequent hydrologic disturbance. This study assessed the potential response of aquatic macroinvertebrates to interannual variation in hydrology in a spatially intermittent desert stream (Sycamore Creek, AZ). We compiled data on the recovery of macroinvertebrate communities following spring floods, with successional sequences captured 11 times over a 16-year period (1983-1999). This period encompassed a transition from perennial to intermittent flow in this system, and included a record drought in 1989-1990. Results show that while the size of floods initiating sequences had little explanatory power, changes in macroinvertebrate community structure during postflood succession were closely associated with antecedent flooding and drought. Year-to-year differences in benthic communities integrated taxon-specific responses to antecedent disturbance, including differential resistance to channel drying, use of hyporheic refugia, and variable rates of recovery once stream flow resumed. The long-term consequences of drying on community structure were only evident during later stages of postflood succession, illustrating an interaction between flood and drought recovery processes in this system. Our observations highlight the potential for predicted climate changes in this region to have marked and long-lasting consequences for benthic communities in desert streams.

AB Temperature-induced coral bleaching is a major threat to the biodiversity of coral reef ecosystems. While reductions in species diversity and abundance of fish communities have been documented following coral bleaching, the mechanisms that underlie these changes are poorly understood. The present study examined the impacts of coral bleaching on the early life-history processes of coral reef fishes. Daily monitoring of fish settlement patterns found that ten times as many fish settled to healthy coral than sub-lethally bleached coral. Species diversity of settling fishes was least on bleached coral and greatest on dead coral, with healthy coral having intermediate levels of diversity. Laboratory experiments using light-trap caught juveniles showed that different damselfish species chose among healthy, bleached and dead coral habitats using different combinations of visual and olfactory cues. The live coral specialist, Pomacentrus moluccensis, preferred live coral and avoided bleached and dead coral, using mostly visual cues to inform their habitat choice. The habitat generalist, Pomacentrus amboinensis, also preferred live coral and avoided bleached and dead coral but selected these habitats using both visual and olfactory cues. Trials with another habitat generalist, Dischistodus sp., suggested that vision played a significant role. A 20 days field experiment that manipulated densities of P. moluccensis on healthy and bleached coral heads found an influence of fish density on juvenile weight and growth, but no significant influence of habitat quality. These results suggests that coral bleaching will affect settlement patterns and species distributions by influencing the visual and olfactory cues that reef fish larvae use to make settlement choices. Furthermore, increased fish density within the remaining healthy coral habitats could play an important role in influencing population dynamics.

AB Anthropogenic activity is currently leading to dramatic transformations of ecosystems and losses of biodiversity. The recognition that these ecosystems provide services that are essential for human well-being has led to a major interest in the forms of the biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationship. However, there is a lack of studies examining the impact of climate change on these relationships and it remains unclear how multiple climatic drivers may affect levels of ecosystem functioning. Here, we examine the roles of two important climate change variables, temperature and concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide, on the relationship between invertebrate species richness and nutrient release in a model benthic estuarine system. We found a positive relationship between invertebrate species richness and the levels of release of NH4-N into the water column, but no effect of species richness on the release of PO4-P. Higher temperatures and greater concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide had a negative impact on nutrient release. Importantly, we found significant interactions between the climate variables, indicating that reliably predicting the effects of future climate change will not be straightforward as multiple drivers are unlikely to have purely additive effects, resulting in increased levels of uncertainty.

AB Metapopulation theory is one of the most popular approaches to identify the factors affecting the spatial and temporal dynamics of populations in fragmented habitat networks. Habitat quality, patch area and isolation are mainly focused on when analyzing distribution patterns in fragmented landscapes. The effects of landscape heterogeneity in the non-occupied matrix, however, have been largely neglected. Here, we determined the relative importance of patch quality and landscape attributes on the occurrence, density and extinction of the Dupont's lark (Chersophilus duponti), an endangered steppe passerine whose habitat has been extremely reduced to highly isolated and fragmented patches embedded in a mainly unsuitable landscape matrix. Habitat patch quality, measured in terms of vegetation structure, grazing pressure, arthropod availability, predator abundance, and inter-specific competition, did not affect occurrence, density or extinction. At the landscape scale, however, the species' occurrence was principally determined by the interactions among patch size, geographic isolation and landscape matrix. Isolation had the main independent contribution to explaining the probability of occurrence, followed by landscape matrix composition and patch size. The species' density was negatively correlated to patch size, suggesting crowding effects in small fragments, while extinction events were exclusively related to isolation. Our findings suggest that landscape rather than local population characteristics are crucial in determining the patterns of distribution and abundance of non-equilibrium populations in highly fragmented habitat networks. Consequently, conservation measures for these species should simultaneously involve patch size, isolation and landscape matrix and apply to the entire metapopulation rather than to particular patches.

AB Genetic data are often critical for defining populations for management purposes (e.g., identifying geographic boundaries or diagnostic characters for genetically discrete subunits) but can be called into question by both scientific and legal review. This can result in reversed or delayed implementation of management actions. We discuss methods for data quality control and quality analysis and describe examples of steps applied to 2 of the most common types of genetic data, mitochondrial DNA sequences, and microsatellite genotypes. These steps can serve both as guides to conservation geneticists and as an initial protocol for managers to determine whether genetic data will hold up against legal and scientific challenges. In addition, we suggest types of data and quality measures that should be reported as supplementary materials to published reports. These supplementary data serve to reduce the occurrence of legal and conservation controversies and improve reproducibility over time in population genetics studies where genetic monitoring is likely to play an increasing role.

AB Understanding the environmental and human determinants of forest fire ignitions is crucial for landscape management. In this study, we consider lightning-and human-induced fires separately and evaluate the relative importance of weather, forest composition and human activities on the occurrence of forest fire ignitions in the most fire-prone region of Switzerland, the Canton Ticino. Independent variables included 14 drought and fire weather indices, forest composition and human influences. Logistic regression models were used to relate these independent variables to records of forest fires over a 37-year period (1969-2005). We found large differences in the importance of environmental and human controls on forest fire ignitions between lightning- and human-induced events: lightning-induced fires occurred in a small range of weather conditions well captured by the Duff Moisture Code from the Canadian Forest Fire Weather Index System and the LandClim Drought Index, and with negligible influence of distance to human infrastructure, whereas human-induced fires occurred in a wider range of weather conditions well captured by the Angstroem and the Fosberg Fire Weather Index, mainly in deciduous forests, and strongly depending on proximity to human infrastructure. We conclude that the suitability of fire indices can vary dramatically between ignition sources, suggesting that some of these indices are useful within certain regions and fire types only. The ignition source is an important factor that needs to be taken into account by fire managers and when developing models of forest fire occurrence.

AB Species distribution maps are needed for ecosystem-based marine management including the development of marine spatial plans. If such maps are based on predictive models then modelling procedures should aim to maximise validation success, and any uncertainty in the predictions needs to be made explicit, We developed a predictive modelling approach to produce robust maps of the distributions of selected marine species at a regional scale. We used 14 years of survey data to map the distributions of plaice, sole and thornback ray in three hydrographic regions comprising parts of the Irish Sea. Celtic Sea and the English Channel with the help of the hybrid technique regression kriging. which combines regression models with geostatistical tools. For each species-region combination we constructed logistic Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) based on presence-absence data using the environmental variables: depth, bottom temperature, bed shear stress and sediment type, as predictors. We selected GLMs using the mean squared error of prediction (MSEP) estimated by cross-validation then conducted a geostatistical analysis of the residuals to incorporate spatial structure in the predictions. In general, we found that species occurrence was positively related to shallow areas, a bed shear stress of between 0 and 1.5 N/m(2), and the presence of sandy sediment. Predicted species occurrence probabilities were in good agreement with survey observations. This modelling framework selects environmental models based on predictive ability and considers the effect of spatial autocorrelation on predictions, together with the simultaneous presentation of observations. associated uncertainties, and predictions. The potential benefit of these distribution maps to marine management and planning is discussed. (C) 2008 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Designing a representative network of high seas marine protected areas (MPAs) requires an acceptable scheme to classify the benthic (as well as the pelagic) bioregions of the oceans. Given the lack of sufficient biological information to accomplish this task, we used a multivariate statistical method with 6 biophysical variables (depth, seabed slope, sediment thickness, primary production, bottom water dissolved oxygen and bottom temperature) to objectively classify the ocean floor into 53,713 separate polygons comprising 11 different categories, that we have termed "seascapes". A cross-check of the seascape classification was carried out by comparing the seascapes with existing maps of seafloor geomorphology and seabed sediment type and by GIS analysis of the number of separate polygons, polygon area and perimeter/area ratio. We conclude that seascapes, derived using a multivariate statistical approach, are biophysically meaningful subdivisions of the ocean floor and can be expected to contain different biological associations, in as much as different geomorphological units do the same. Less than 20% of some seascapes occur in the high seas while other seascapes are largely confined to the high seas, indicating specific types of environment whose protection and conservation will require international cooperation. Our study illustrates how the identification of potential sites for high seas marine protected areas can be accomplished by a simple GIS analysis of seafloor geomorphic and seascape classification maps. Using this approach, maps of seascape and geomorphic heterogeneity were generated in which heterogeneity hotspots identify themselves as MPA candidates. The use of computer-aided mapping tools removes subjectivity in the MPA design process and provides greater confidence to stakeholders that an unbiased result has been achieved.

AB Tropical estuarine fish assemblages often show characteristic spatial variation at the scale of individual estuaries but there is no clear grouping of estuaries based Oil variables such as proximity or climatic conditions. This study investigates if Such spatial patterns occur at more extensive spatial scales and begins to uncover the mechanisms driving these patterns. We sampled 21 estuaries spanning 650 kin of the tropical northeastern coast of Australia that. comprise 3 climatic zones and 7 discrete regions. The 21 estuaries possessed broadly similar fish assemblages; however, there was considerable variation in the details of faunal composition, species richness and catch per unit effort (CPUE) of individual species. This variation had little to do with an estuary's proximity to other sites or its climatic zone but was focussed at the estuary-to-estuary scale. The variability was largely a product of contrasting spatial patterns displayed by different species. In turn, the complex assemblage and species patterns seemed to be influenced in complex ways by contrasting responses to physical and ecological variables, with estuary-level ecological variables generally having greater power in explaining faunal differences than site-specific physical variables. The fact that estuary-level ecological variables produced a good explanation of the complex spatial patterns typical of tropical estuarine fauna indicates the value of developing estuary-scale explanatory variables that relate to specific ecological processes. The lack of any clear influence of climatic zone or proximity to other sites on spatial patterns highlights the continual need for careful evaluation of paradigmatic understanding,

AB Global climate change is likely to have an important influence on the phenology, behaviour and population dynamics of many species. We investigate climatic related changes in the breeding phenology of Mediterranean loggerhead marine turtles Caretta caretta over a 19 year period and the potential relationship between these changes and reproductive success and performance. We found that the studied population has experienced fluctuating sea surface temperatures (SST) with an increasing trend during the last century. With increasing spring SST there is a trend towards earlier nesting. However, there is no significant relationship between SST and nesting season, defined as the duration between the first recorded emergence and the last nest laid. Our analyses indicate that marine turtles display phenological changes, and thus maintain favorable thermal conditions at the nesting sites. Furthermore, increasing spring SST was correlated with decreasing clutch size and increasing hatching success that resulted in an apparent lack of correlation between SST and hatchling production. This apparent independence might be misleading since it only holds for a limited range of SST values. Thus, if we estimate the effect of climate change on loggerhead population growth as neutral, based on the apparent independence between SST and total number of hatchlings, we will be underestimating the population extinction risk.

AB Transpiration (E) is regulated over short time periods by stomatal conductance (G(s)) and over multi-year periods by tree- and stand-structural factors such as leaf area, height and density, with upper limits ultimately set by climate. We tested the hypothesis that tree structure, stand structure and G(s) together regulate E per ground area (E-g) within climatic limits using three sites located across a steep climatic gradient: a low-elevation Juniperus woodland, a mid-elevation Pinus forest and a high-elevation Picea forest. We measured leaf area : sapwood area ratio (A(1) : A(s)), height and ecosystem sapwood area : ground area ratio (A(s) : A(g)) to assess long-term structural adjustments, tree-ring carbon isotope ratios (delta C-13) to assess seasonal gas exchange, and whole-tree E and G(s) to assess short-term regulation. We used a hydraulic model based on Darcy's law to interpret the interactive regulation of G(s) and E-g. Common allometric dependencies were found only in the relationship of sapwood area to diameter for pine and spruce; there were strong site differences for allometric relationships of sapwood area to basal area, A(1) : A(s) and A(s) : A(g). On a sapwood area basis, E decreased with increasing elevation, but this pattern was reversed when E was scaled to the crown using A(1) : A(s) . E-g was controlled largely by A(s) : A(g), and both E-g and G(s) declined from high- to low-elevation sites. Observation-model comparisons of E-g, G(s) and delta C-13 were strongest using the hydraulic model parameterized with precipitation, vapour pressure deficit, A(1) : A(s), height, and A(s) : A(g), supporting the concept that climate, G(s), tree- and stand-structure interact to regulate E-g.

AB Several studies have shown that the contribution of individual species to the positive relationship between species richness and community biomass production cannot be easily predicted from species monocultures. Here, we used a biodiversity experiment with a pool of nine potentially dominant grassland species to relate the species richness-productivity relationship to responses in density, size and aboveground allocation patterns of individual species. Aboveground community biomass increased strongly with the transition from monocultures to two-species mixtures but only slightly with the transition from two- to nine-species mixtures. Tripartite partitioning showed that the strong increase shown by the former was due to trait-independent complementarity effects, while the slight increase shown by the latter was due to dominance effects. Trait-dependent complementarity effects depended on species composition. Relative yield total (RYT) was greater than 1 (RYT > 1) in mixtures but did not increase with species richness, which is consistent with the constant complementarity effect. The relative yield (RY) of only one species, Arrhenatherum elatius, continually increased with species richness, while those of the other species studied decreased with species richness or varied among different species compositions within richness levels. High observed/expected RYs (RYo/RYe > 1) of individual species were mainly due to increased module densities, whereas low observed/expected RYs (RYo/RYe < 1) were due to more pronounced decreases in module density (species with stoloniferous or creeping growth) or module size (species with clearly-defined plant individuals). The trade-off between module density and size, typical for plant populations under the law of constant final yield, was compensated among species. The positive trait-independent complementarity effect could be explained by an increase in community module density, which reached a maximum at low species richness. In contrast, the increasing dominance effect was attributable to the species-specific ability, in particular that of A. elatius, to increase module size, while intrinsic growth limitations led to a suppression of the remaining species in many mixtures.

AB We propose a novel theory for the evolution of polyandry driven by genetic benefits to females whose offspring interbreed. In species with an ecology characterized by frequent colonization of new habitat patches, consanguineous matings may be common during the early stages of colonization, but genetic diversity may grow as new colonizers arrive. We show that with levels of inbreeding depression similar to those found in predominantly inbreeding populations, a polyandrous female can benefit her descendants since matings among her brood are mainly between half siblings rather than full siblings. We examine the invasion by a polyandrous phenotype using explicit genetic models in which costs of inbreeding are themselves subject to selection. In common with other models of inbreeding, we find that underlying high levels of inbreeding tend to purge deleterious recessive alleles, and hence these are unlikely to maintain sufficient inbreeding depression to favour polyandry. However, if costs of inbreeding are due to overdominance, biologically realistic levels of inbreeding depression result in genetic benefits large enough to favour polyandry provided it is not too costly. The potential significance of polyandry as a mechanism to reduce inbreeding in grandchildren will depend upon the genetic basis of inbreeding depression in natural, inbreeding populations.

AB Population connectivity (and isolation) and genetic diversity in declining species are important considerations for species recovery and habitat restoration programs. For lotic species, stream confluences with major rivers may be a determinant of population isolation among streams, although small-scale dynamics in population connectivity within streams may also represent attributes of population functioning (e.g. resilience, recolonisation) that are important for species recovery programs. In this study, we examined the importance of among- and within-stream patterns of population connectivity and genetic diversity in the regionally vulnerable southern pygmy perch (Nannoperca australis) in a series of degraded streams in south east Australia in which population declines have been reported. We used molecular markers (mtDNA and micros atellites) to examine among-stream patterns of population connectivity and genetic diversity, and molecular markers and stable isotopic signatures of nitrogen and carbon to examine within-stream connectivity in the species. Results revealed that populations of N. australis are isolated among streams, and that streams therefore represent functional population units for species recovery and habitat restoration programs. Within-streams, local populations were semi-discrete and connected by various degrees of dispersal, with the degree of connectivity differing between the streams. Genetic bottlenecks were not detected, although the effective population size of N. australis in the more fragmented stream may be lower than in the stream where greater population connectivity was found. Protecting and augmenting refugial habitat of extant populations and restoring corridor functions between refugia within streams will generate the greatest biological response at within-stream scales.

AB Colonization is the crucial process underlying range expansions, biological invasions, and metapopulation dynamics. Which individuals leave their natal population to colonize empty habitats is a crucial question and is presently unresolved. Dispersal is the first step in colonization. However, not all dispersing individuals are necessarily good colonizers. Indeed, in some species, the phenotype of dispersers differs depending on the selective pressures that induce dispersal. In particular, kin-based interactions, a factor driving social evolution, should induce different social response profiles in nondispersing and dispersing individuals. Kin competition (defined here as between the mother and offspring) has been proven to produce dispersers with a particular phenotype that may enhance their colonizing ability. By using the common lizard (Lacerta vivipara), we conducted a multipopulation experiment to study the effect of kin competition on dispersal and colonization success. We manipulated mother-offspring interactions, which are the most important component of kin competition in the studied species, at the family and population levels and measured the consequences on colonization success. We demonstrate that mother-offspring competition at the population level significantly influences colonization success. increased competition at the population level enhanced the colonization rate of the largest juveniles as well as the growth and survival of the colonizers. Based on these results, we calculated that kin-induced colonization halves the extinction probability of a newly initiated population. Because interactions between relatives are likely to affect the ability of a species to track habitat modifications, kin-based dispersal should be considered in the study of invasion dynamics and metapopulation functioning.

AB Human-induced changes to natural systems can cause major disturbances to fundamental ecological and population processes and result in local extinctions and secondary contacts between formerly isolated species. Extensive fur seal harvesting during the nineteenth century on Macquarie Island (subantarctic) resulted in extinction of the original population. Recolonization by three species has been slow and complex, characterized by the establishment of breeding groups of Antarctic and subantarctic fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella and Arctocephalus tropicalis) and presumed nonbreeding (itinerant) male New Zealand fur seals (Arctocephalus forsteri). One thousand and seven pups from eight annual cohorts (1992-2003) were analysed using mitochondrial control region data (RFLP) and 10 microsatellite loci to estimate species composition and hybridization. Antarctic fur seals predominated, but hybridization occurred between all three species (17-30% of all pups). Involvement of New Zealand fur seals was unexpected as females are absent and males are not observed to hold territories during the breeding season. The proportion of hybrids in the population has fallen over time, apparently owing to substantial influxes of pure Antarctic and subantarctic individuals and non-random mating. Over 50% of New Zealand hybrids and 43% of Antarctic-subantarctic hybrids were not F-1, which indicates some degree of hybrid reproductive success, and this may be underestimated: simulations showed that hybrids become virtually undetectable by the third generation of backcrossing. While human impacts seem to have driven novel hybridization in this population, the present 'time slices' analysis suggests some biological resistance to complete homogenization.

AB We conducted two studies on how highways affect their adjacent habitats by sampling carabid beetles (Coleoptera, Carabidae) in patches of formerly continuous forest next to highways. (1) We sampled carabids at 14 highway intersections near Helsinki, Finland. Each intersection (constructed 2-40 years ago) had two forested patches to study: a remnant (0.5-37.4 ha) and, isolated from the remnant by an intersection lane, an islet (size 0.2-1.8 ha). Pitfall trap catch data (2301 carabids, 25 species) showed that remnants hosted higher catches of three carabid species, and slightly higher species richness, than islets (patch-size effect). Time since intersection construction had no apparent effect on carabids. Traffic volume along the intersection lane determined the assemblage structure of carabids in dry patches, and the abundance of a forest carabid Calathus micropterus. Compared to moist patches, drier patches hosted lower catches of four generalist species; they also had different assemblages of carabids (habitat-type effect). An interaction between patch size and habitat type for a forest generalist Pterostichus oblongopunctatus indicated that the patch-size effect was dependent on habitat type. (2) We examined possible dispersal of carabids among forested patches that were separated by highway lanes in Drenthe, the Netherlands. We released 2696 marked individuals of 10 species, and recaptured 376 using dry pitfall traps. We found no evidence for inter-patch movement for nine forest species, but 22 of 225 recaptured individuals of Poecilus versicolor, an eurytopic open-habitat species, had crossed the highway. Catches of seven forest species were also significantly lower in the road verges, compared to the adjacent forests. These two studies suggest that (i) decreasing patch size negatively affects forest-carabid catch and overall species richness, (ii) habitat type can affect the intensity of the patch-size effect, (iii) carabid assemblages of forest fragments vary with traffic volume (which may be linked with urbanization), (iv) forest carabids rarely cross highways, and (v) open habitats associated with road margins are dispersal barriers for forest carabids.

AB The Iberian cyprinid fauna, characterized by the presence of numerous endemic species, has suffered from significant habitat degradation. The critically endangered Squalius aradensis is restricted to small drainages of southern Portugal, habitats that typically exhibit a characteristic Mediterranean-type heterogeneous hydrological system throughout the year, including alternation of flooding events during winter and complete drought in large river sections during summer. To assess the effect of historical and recent processes on genetic diversity in S. aradensis we examined within- and among-population variability in cytochrome b and six polymorphic microsatellite loci. Estimates of genetic diversity in time and space through the combined use of traditional Phi-/F-statistics, phylogenetic trees, ordination methods and nested clade analysis indicated significant and congruent structuring among populations. Data suggest that the Arade drainage represent the evolutionary centre of the species, with subsequent allopatric fragmentation across drainages. Factors other than isolation by distance strongly affected the within-drainage genetic differentiation observed in these Mediterranean-type drainages, including recent population expansion from a bottleneck event and restricted gene flow imposed by a long-term barrier (brackish water area). Significant correlation was found between S. aradensis allelic diversity and upstream drainage area. The relevance of findings for conservation issues is discussed in relation to local intermittent hydrological conditions, the highly restricted distribution and the critically endangered status of the species.

AB The shovelnose guitarfish Rhinobatos productus is an evolutionarily, ecologically, and economically important ray, with a continuous distribution from San Francisco, California (USA), to Mazatlan, Sinaloa, and in the Gulf of California (Mexico). Regional studies have revealed morphometric differences between shovelnose from the Gulf of California and the Pacific coast of Baja California, which may result from phenotypic plasticity in the presence of high levels of gene flow or from a degree of genetic differentiation in the presence of cryptic isolation within a continuous distribution. We used PCR-RFLP of the mitochondrial control region to assess the degree of genetic differentiation between Gulf of California and Pacific shovelnose guitarfish. We found very high levels of molecular diversity (averages: h=0.77, pi=1.19%), which may be associated with historically large and stable populations, as well as very significant levels of genetic differentiation between gulf and Pacific samples (chi(2)=64, P<0.0001; Phi(ST)=0.63, P<0.0001, mean nucleotide divergence d=2.47%). We found a deep phylogeographic break between haplotypes from the gulf and the Pacific, which may suggest the existence of cryptic species but clearly indicates more than one evolutionarily significant unit of R. productus. Our results show a pattern of genetic structure and levels of differentiation consistent with the geological history of the region. Furthermore, these findings have wide-ranging implications for the management and conservation of cartilaginous fish in Mexico, as they reveal the existence of biological diversity that will go unnoticed without the genetic scrutiny of intraspecific variation and that is highly relevant for much needed management and conservation efforts.

AB A generalised linear model was used to predict climatically suitable habitat for the golden bowerbird (Prionodura newtonia De Vis), an endemic species of the Wet Tropics of North Queensland. Mean temperature of the coldest quarter and mean precipitation of the wettest quarter were found to be the best habitat predictors. For independent validation data, accuracy was 67% (Kappa statistic, n = 30). Past, and future habitats suitable to the golden bowerbird were mapped by altering the temperature and precipitation input to the model. In the current climate, total potential habitat is estimated to be 1564 km(2), occurring as a number of separate patches with distinct bowerbird subpopulations. Past habitat was most limiting, 406 km(2), during the Holocene climatic optimum (c. 5000-3600 YBP, + 2 degreesC and + 50% rainfall relative to today). With future warming, assuming a 10% decrease in rainfall, potential habitat is reduced to 582 km(2) (1 degreesC warming), 163 km(2) (2 degreesC warming) and 37 km(2) (3 degreesC warming). Thus, global warming in the coming decades is likely to be a significant threat to the survival of this and similar upland and highland species in the tropics.

AB Backgroud and Aims The genus Bupleurum has long been recognized as a natural group, but its infrageneric classification is controversial and has not yet been studied in the light of sequence data.
   Methods Phylogenetic relationships among 32 species (35 taxa) of the genus Bupleurum were investigated by comparative sequencing of the ITS region of the 18-26S nuclear ribosomal DNA repeat. Exemplar taxa from all currently accepted sections and subsections of the genus were included, along with outgroups from four other early branching Apioideae genera (Anginon, Heteromorpha, Physospermum and Pleurospermum).
   Key Results Phylogenies generated by maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood, and neighbour-joining methods show similar topologies, demonstrating monophyly of Bupleurum and the division of the genus into two major clades. This division is also supported by analysis of the 5.8S coding sequence alone. The first branching clade is formed by all the species of the genus with pinnate-reticulate veined leaves and B. rigidum with a unique type of leaf venation. The other major clade includes the remaining species studied, all of which have more or less parallel-veined leaves.
   Conclusions These phylogenetic results do not agree with any previous classifications of the genus. Molecular data also suggest that the endemic Macaronesian species B. salicifolium is a neoendemic, as the sequence divergence between the populations in Madeira and Canary Islands, and closer mainland relatives in north-west Africa is small. All endemic north-west African taxa are included in a single unresolved but well-supported clade, and the low nucleotide variation of ITS suggests a recent radiation within this group. The only southern hemisphere species, B. mundii (southern Africa), is shown to be a neoendemic, apparently closely related to B. falcatum, a Eurasian species. (C) 2004 Annals of Botany Company.

AB Aim To test the effectiveness of statistical models based on explanatory environmental variables vs. existing distribution information (maps and breeding atlas), for predicting the distribution of four species of raptors (family Accipitridae): common buzzard Buteo buteo (Linnaeus, 1758), short-toed eagle Circaetus gallicus (Gmelin, 1788), booted eagle Hieraaetus pennatus (Gmelin, 1788) and black kite Milvus migrans (Boddaert, 1783).
   Location Andalusia, southern Spain.
   Methods Generalized linear models of 10 x 10 km squares surveyed for the presence/absence of the species by road census. Statistical models use as predictors variables derived from topography, vegetation and land-use, and the geographical coordinates (to take account of possible spatial trends). Predictions from the models are compared with current distribution maps from the national breeding atlas and leading reference works.
   Results The maps derived from statistical models for all four species were more predictive than the previously published range maps and the recent national breeding atlas. The best models incorporated both topographic and vegetation and land-use variables. Further, in three of the four species the inclusion of spatial coordinates to account for neighbourhood effects improved these models. Models for the common buzzard and black kite were highly predictive and easy to interpret from an ecological point of view, while models for short-toed eagle and, particularly, booted eagle were not so easy to interpret, but still predicted better than previous distribution information.
   Main conclusions It is possible to build accurate predictive models for raptor distribution with a limited field survey using as predictors environmental variables derived from digital maps. These models integrated in a geographical information system produced distribution maps that were more accurate than previously published ones for the study species in the study area. Our study is an example of a methodology that could be used for many taxa and areas to improve unreliable distribution information.

AB Cuticular hydrocarbons are among the prime candidates for nestmate recognition in social insects. We analyzed the variation of cuticular hydrocarbons in the termite species M. subhyalinus in West Africa (Comoe National Park) on a small spatial scale (<1 km). We found considerable variation in the composition of cuticular hydrocarbons among colonies, with four distinct chemical phenotypes. Different phenotypes occurred within each of the four habitats. The difference between these phenotypes is primarily due to unsaturated compounds. A clear correlation between the difference of the hydrocarbon composition and the aggression between colonies was found. This correlation also holds in a multivariate analysis of genetic similarity (measured by AFLPs), morphometric distances (measured by Mahalanobis-distances), as well as geographic distances between colonies. In a more detailed analysis of the correlation between the composition of cuticular hydrocarbons and aggression, we found that no single compound is sufficient to explain variation in aggression between pairings of colonies. Thus, termites seem to use a bouquet of compounds. Multiple regression analysis suggested that many of these compounds are unsaturated hydrocarbons and, thus, may play a key role in colony recognition.

AB We sequenced 2690 nucleotides of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) including the entire control region (CR), partial 12S and 16S ribosomal RNAs, NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2, and cytochrome b genes from representatives of all the 17 living species of grouse and ptarmigan (Aves; Galliformes; subfamily Tetraoninae), Substitution rates and phylogenetic signals were variable among genes, with the CR being more informative than protein-coding and rRNA genes. Phylogenetic trees, computed with the CR or the concatenated sequences, indicate that: (1) genus Bonasa is monophyletic and basal within the subfamily, (2) all the other currently recognized genera of Tetraoninae are monophyletic, except Dendragapus; (3) D. obscurus is related to Centrocercus urophasianus and divergent from former D. canadensis and D. falcipennis, which, accordingly, may be ascribed to the distinct genus Falcipennis; (4) Tympanuchus, Dendragapus, and Centrocercus form a clade comprising taxa distributed exclusively in North America; and (5) the North American species of Bonasa (B. umbellus) and Lagopus (L. leucurus) are basal to their Eurasian and Holarctic congeneric species. These findings, and a dispersal-vicariance analysis, support a North American origin of the subfamily and of all the genera of Tetraoninae, with the possible exception of Tetrao. Present species distributions might have been attained by at least three dispersal events from North America to Eurasia, involving the ancestors to Palearctic Bonasa, the ancestors to circumpolar Lagopus mutus/L. lagopus, and the clade leading to Tetrao/Falcipennis. According to a "standard calibration" of the mtDNA molecular clock (2% sequence divergence per million years), Bonasa split about 5-6 million years ago, the other genera diverged during the upper Pliocene, and most of the congeneric species with North American and Eurasian distributions (Bonasa, Lagopus, and Falcipennis) originated during the lower Pleistocene, well before the last interruption of the Beringian land bridge.

AB The effect of arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) on white clover and ryegrass grown together in a soil spiked with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) was assessed in a pot experiment. The soil was spiked with 500 mg kg(-1) anthracene, 500 mg kg(-1) chrysene and 50 mg kg(-1) dibenz(a,h)anthracene, representing common PAH compounds with three, four and five aromatic rings, respectively. Three treatments and two harvest times (8 and 16 weeks) were imposed on plants grown in spiked soil: no mycorrhizal inoculation, mycorrhizal inoculation (Glomus mosseae P2, BEG 69) and mycorrhizal inoculation and surfactant addition (Triton X-100). Pots without PAH were also included as a control of plant growth and mycorrhizal colonization as affected by PAH additions. The competitive ability of clover vis-g-vis ryegrass regarding shoot and root growth was enhanced by AM, but reduced by PAH and the added surfactant. This was reflected by mycorrhizal root colonization which was moderate for clover (20-40% of total root length) and very low for ryegrass (0.5-5% of total root length). Colonization of either plant was similar in spiked soil with and without the added surfactant, but the PAH reduced colonization of clover to half that in non-spiked soil. P uptake was maintained in mycorrhizal clover when PAH were added, but was reduced in non-mycorrhizal clover and in mycorrhizal clover that received surfactant. Similar effects were not observed on ryegrass. These results are discussed in the context of the natural attenuation of organic pollutants in soils.

AB Genetic improvement of crops has traditionally been achieved through sexual hybridization between related species, which has resulted in numerous cultivars with high yields and superior agronomic performance. Conventional plant breeding, sometimes combined with classical cytogenetic techniques, continues to be the main method of cereal crop improvement. More recently, through the introduction of new tools of biotechnology, crossing barriers have been overcome, and genes from unrelated sources have become available to be introduced asexually into plants. Cereal crops were initially difficult to genetically engineer, mainly due to their recalcitrance to in vitro regeneration and their resistance to Agrobacterium infection. Systematic screening of cultivars and explant tissues for regeneration potential, development of various DNA delivery methods and optimization of gene expression cassettes have produced transformation protocols for the major cereals, although some elite cultivars still remain recalcitrant to transformation. Most of the transgenic cereals developed for commercial purpose exhibit herbicide and/or insect resistance; traits that are often controlled by a single gene. In recent years, more complex traits, such as dough functionality in wheat and nutritional quality of rice have been improved by the use of biotechnology. The current challenges for genetic engineering of plants will be to understand and control factors causing transgene silencing, instability and rearrangement, which are often seen in transgenic plants and highly undesirable in lines to be used for crop development. Further improvement of current cereal cultivars is expected to benefit greatly from information emerging from the areas of genomics, proteomics and bioinformatics.

Here, we briefly summarise mt gene organisation in the Metazoa and review what is known of the mt genomes of nematodes and flatworms parasitic in humans. The availability of complete or almost complete mtDNA sequences for several parasitic helminths provides a rich source of genetic markers for phylogenetic analysis and study of genetic variability in helminth groups. Examples of the application of mtDNA in studies on Ascaris, Onchocerca, Schistosoma, Fasciola, Paragonimus, Eckinostoma, Echinococcus and Taenia are described. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB The elongation factor 1 alpha (EF-1 alpha) has become widely employed as a phylogenetic marker for studying eukaryotic evolution. However, a disturbing problem, the artifactual polyphyly of ciliates, is always observed. It has been suggested that the addition of new sequences will help to circumvent this problem. Thus, we have determined 15 new ciliate EF-1 alpha sequences, providing for a more comprehensive taxonomic sampling of this phylum. These sequences have been analyzed together with a representation of eukaryotic sequences using distance-, parsimony-, and likelihood-based phylogenetic methods. Such analyses again failed to recover the monophyly of Ciliophora. A study of the substitution rate showed that ciliate EF-1 alpha genes exhibit a high evolutionary rate, produced in part by an increased number of variable positions. This acceleration could be related to alterations of the accessory functions acquired by this protein, likely to those involving interactions with the cytoskeleton, which is very modified in the Ciliophora. The high evolutionary rate of these sequences leads to an artificial basal emergence of some ciliates in the eukaryotic tree by effecting a long-branch attraction artifact that produces an asymmetric topology for the basal region of the toe. The use of a maximum-likelihood phylogenetic method (which is less sensitive to long-branch attraction) and the addition of sequences to break long branches allow retrieval of more symmetric topologies, which suggests that the asymmetric part of the tree is most likely artifactual. Therefore, the sole reliable part of the tree appears to correspond to the apical symmetric region. These kinds of observations suggest that the general eukaryotic evolution might have consisted of a massive radiation followed by an increase in the evolutionary rates of certain groups that emerge artificially as early branches in the asymmetric base of the tree. Ciliates in the case of the EF-1 alpha genes would offer clear evidence for this hypothesis.

AB The 18S rRNA database is continuously growing and new tree construction methods are being developed, The present study aims at assessing what effect the addition of recently determined animal 18S rRNA sequences and the use of a recently developed distance matrix calculation method have on the results of some previously published case studies on metazoan phylogeny. When re-assessing three case studies, part of their conclusions was confirmed on the basis of the present 18S rRNA data set: 1) the monophyly of Arthropoda; 2) the monophyly of the Vestimentifera-Pogonophora and their protostome character; 3) the doubt about the monophyletic origin of Echiura-Sipuncula and 4) the coelomate character of Nemertea, Yet, it is also demonstrated that some of the previous results are no longer warranted when updating the analyses: 1) the monophyly of both the Annelida and the Eutrochozoa; 2) the sister-group relationship of Echiura to Vestimentifera-Pogonophora and 3) the polyphyly of the Mesozoa and their close relationship to Myxozoa and Nematodes, In addition, some new very preliminary evidence is provided for: 1) a common ancestry of Platyhelminthes and Mesozoa and the monophyly of the latter group and 2) the monophyly of Clitellata, Hirudinida and Oligochaeta. Finally, doubt is casted on the monophyly of the Polychaeta and the polychaete orders Spionida, Phyllodocida, and Sabellidae, Of course, these hypotheses also need further testing.

AB An 8.5-kb plasmid encoding genes (leuABCD) involved in leucine biosynthesis and a small plasmid of 1.74 kb of yet unknown function were found in the intracellular symbiont, Bucknera aphidicola, of two divergent aphid species, Thelaxes suberi and Tetraneura caerulescens, respectively. The leuABCD-carrying plasmid (pBTs1) was amplified from total aphid DNA by inverse long PCR, using outwardly oriented oligonucleotide primers specific to leuA. The resulting 8.2-kb PCR fragment as well as the 1.74-kb plasmid (pBTc1) were cloned and sequenced. pBTs1 differed from a previously described B. aphidicola plasmid (pRPE) of the aphid Rhopalosiphum padi by the presence of a small heat shock gene (ibp) and in the order of the leuABCD and repA genes. Comparison of both leucine plasmids to the small plasmid pBTc1 revealed extensive similarity with respect to putative replication functions as well as in the presence of a highly conserved open reading frame that was found to be homologous to Escherichia coli YqhA and Haemophilus influenzae H10507 and which may encode an integral membrane protein. The three B. aphidicola plasmids most likely evolved from a common ancestral replicon, which in turn may be distantly related to IncFII plasmids, Phylogenetic affiliations of the B. aphidicola strains of the two aphid species were assessed by sequencing of their 16S rRNA genes. Evaluation of the distribution of the leuABCD-encoding plasmids within a phylogenetic framework suggests independent origins for pBTs1 and pRPE from an ancestral replicon resembling pBTc1. The implications for symbiotic essential amino acid biosynthesis and provisioning are discussed.

AB Responses of photosynthesis, stomatal conductance, water use efficiency (at the beginning of flowering) and production allocation (at full ear/grain ripening) to long-term elevated CO2 were assessed in winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L. cv. MV16). Plants were grown in open top chambers under a temperate-continental climate from germination at ambient (350 mu molmol(-1)) and elevated (700 mu molmol(-1)) CO2 concentrations. High CO2 plants displayed a decreased initial slope of the A/C-i response curve, with the assimilation rate (A) continuing to increase above 400 mu molmol(-1) internal CO2 concentration (C-i). A in the ambient plants showed P regeneration limitation while RuBP regeneration appeared to be limiting A in the high CO2 treatment. Variable fluorescence ratios (Rfd 690) were lower in the high CO2 plants indicating a lower potential photochemical activity. The increase in the values for the chlorophyll fluorescence ratio F690/F735 in the high CO2 plants was in agreement with the lower chlorophyll a+b concentrations. The high CO2 plants had higher concentrations of starch in their leaves and roots that the ambient plants. Stomatal conductance (g(s)) was lower in the high CO2 plants at every CO2 concentration (C-a) and C-i and the C-i-dependent g(s) response had a large influence on the A/g(s), function. The higher water use efficiency (WUE) values (at C-a's > 350 mu molmol(-1)) in the high CO2 wheat plants were the result of a larger decrease in transpiration rate (E) in the high CO2 plants than in the ambient plants, and of a simultaneous larger increase in A in the range of C-a above 350 mu molmol(-1) COP. The integrated and combined effect of the photosynthetic and stomatal acclimation to elevated CO2 produced a higher C-assimilation in high CO2 plants at elevated CO2 than in the ambient plants, however, this was not followed by an acclimation in C-allocation. These were reflected in a slightly increased (6.7%) overall dry matter production and lower reproductive allocation (RA).

ID MINI-RHIZOTRONS; GROWTH; SYSTEM
AB Detailed knowledge of the distribution of roots in the soil is important in understanding the extraction of water and nutrients from soil. Various techniques have been developed to monitor root-length density under field conditions. Excavation techniques, including soil cores, have long been considered to give reliable estimates of root-length density, but these techniques are laborious in sample collection and tedious in determination of root lengths. An attractive alternative for monitoring root-length density has been the minirhizotron whereby a periscope is inserted into a clear tube permanently installed in the soil for repeated and rapid measures of root development. The objective of this study was to compare the ability of the minirhizotron technique to measure root-length density as compared to the root-core technique.
   As in previous studies, substantial disagreement existed between the two techniques in the top 30-cm of the soil, The results from the minirhizotron consistently indicated a much lower root population than the root-core technique in the surface layer of soil. This is especially worrisome because more than 45% of the root-length density was found in this layer with the root-core technique. At deeper soil layers, the minirhizotron data pro;ed to be no less variable than the rest-core technique making the determination of statistically significant results difficult. Finally, the relationship between the minirhizotron and soil-core results varied with time even when the observations from the soil surface layer were ignored. Attempts to directly translate minirhizotron observations into a root-length density using a correlation approach would be suspect based on the results of this experiment.

AB Plankton nets were moored in tidal channels around Lee Stocking Island to monitor larval supply of fishes to nursery habitats that fringe Exuma Sound, Bahamas. Sampling was conducted continuously through two consecutive winters of 1990-1991 and 1991-1992. Meteorological and hydrographic data were also recorded during these periods. Three of the six most abundant taxa (leptocephali, Bothidae and Ophidiidae) showed strong lunar associations, with periodicities between 28 and 30 d. Labrids were the only family to show evidence of any semi-lunar activity. The time series for the families Clupeidae and Tetraodontidae appeared to be stochastic. Cross-correlation analyses were used to examine coupling of larval replenishment and physical processes. Four of six taxa examined showed significant relationships between larval supply and onshore winds at short time lags during 1990-1991. In 1991-1992, however, taxa showed stronger associations with the northwest, long-shore wind component than with onshore winds. Coherency in larval supply among several taxa was remarkably strong. This implies either that the magnitude of spawning is linked among taxa, or that planktonic processes are affecting a number of taxa in very similar ways. The similarities in the magnitude of supply events among taxa found here may be related to complex interactions between larval behavior and the physical environment.

AB Repeated progressive drought and flooding stress were imposed on hybrid poplar clones Populus X euramericana 'Eugenei', and Populus tristis X Populus balsamifera 'Tristis' grown in pots in a greenhouse under two nitrogen levels. In both clones the rate of leaf initiation was promoted only in high-N plants subjected to minimum water stress. Water stress alone did not retard the rate of leaf initiation, but it significantly reduced leaf expansion of 'Eugenei', whereas only flooding led to smaller leaves in 'Tristis'. The addition of N stimulated leaf expansion, leaf chlorophyll and N concentrations, and leaf and stem biomass production across soil moisture levels, but the greatest effect of N was associated with minimum water stress. High N altered carbon allocation towards the aboveground portions, leading to lower root to shoot ratios. High N also appeared to stimulate initiation of fine roots. Soil moisture determined the amount of biomass that accumulated in roots, with highest root production in well-watered pots and lowest in flooded pots, with the droughted treatment in between. Leaves became thinner as soil moisture decreased from flooding. Stem biomass of 'Tristis' declined more under flooding than under drought, whereas 'Eugenei' displayed a greater reduction of stem biomass in droughty than in flooded soil.

ID FRUIT BATS; ENERGY; POLLINATION; SELECTION; BIOLOGY; FOOD
AB The Queensland blossom bat (Syconycteris australis) is a specialist nectar and pollen feeder. Its dietary maintenance nitrogen requirement (MNR), determined by feeding blossom bats varying levels of pollen in an artificial sugar solution, was 337 mg N . kg-0.75 . d-1. This is similar to nitrogen requirements predicted from the standard metabolic rate of blossom bats. Dry-matter digestibility (79%-89%) and partial apparent nitrogen digestibility (58%-97%) was high for the sugar/pollen diet. Dry-matter intake was not correlated with dietary nitrogen as previously predicted for pteropodids. Although pollen is a rich source of dietary nitrogen, it is a highly dispersed food source. On the basis of nitrogen content of Banksia pollen and mean pollen standing crops (27 +/- 2 pollen bundles per inflorescence, N = 128) I predict that many Banksia inflorescences (36-48) need to be visited each night to satisfy the MNR of an 18-g blossom bat. Even more Banksia inflorescences (28-62) must be visited nightly to satisfy allometrically predicted energy requirements of blossom bats on the basis of mean Banksia energy standing crops (1.2 +/- 0.1 kJ per inflorescence, N = 128). Previous interpretations of nitrogen as the primary limiting nutrient to flying foxes may need to be reconsidered for those species that supplement their diet with pollen.

AB Biological invasions continue to threaten the stability of ecosystems and societies that are dependent on their services. Whilst the ecological impacts of invasive alien species (IAS) have been widely reported in recent decades, there remains a paucity of information concerning their economic impacts. Europe has strong trade and transport links with the rest of the world, facilitating hundreds of IAS incursions, and largely centralised decision-making frameworks. The present study is the first comprehensive and detailed effort that quantifies the costs of IAS collectively across European countries and examines temporal trends in these data. In addition, the distributions of costs across countries, socioeconomic sectors and taxonomic groups are examined, as are socio-economic correlates of management and damage costs. Total costs of IAS in Europe summed to US$140.20 billion (or euro116.61 billion) between 1960 and 2020, with the majority (60%) being damage-related and impacting multiple sectors. Costs were also geographically widespread but dominated by impacts in large western and central European countries, i.e. the UK, Spain, France, and Germany. Human population size, land area, GDP, and tourism were significant predictors of invasion costs, with management costs additionally predicted by numbers of introduced species, research effort and trade. Temporally, invasion costs have increased exponentially through time, with up to US$23.58 billion (euro19.64 billion) in 2013, and US$139.56 billion (euro116.24 billion) in impacts extrapolated in 2020. Importantly, although these costs are substantial, there remain knowledge gaps on several geographic and taxonomic scales, indicating that these costs are severely underestimated. We, thus, urge increased and improved cost reporting for economic impacts of IAS and coordinated international action to prevent further spread and mitigate impacts of IAS populations.

AB Human-driven habitat fragmentation and loss have led to a proliferation of small and isolated plant and animal populations with high risk of extinction. One of the main threats to extinction in these populations is inbreeding depression, which is primarily caused by recessive deleterious mutations becoming homozygous due to inbreeding. The typical approach for managing these populations is to maintain high genetic diversity, increasingly by translocating individuals from large populations to initiate a "genetic rescue." However, the limitations of this approach have recently been highlighted by the demise of the gray wolf population on Isle Royale, which declined to the brink of extinction soon after the arrival of a migrant from the large mainland wolf population. Here, we use a novel population genetic simulation framework to investigate the role of genetic diversity, deleterious variation, and demographic history in mediating extinction risk due to inbreeding depression in small populations. We show that, under realistic models of dominance, large populations harbor high levels of recessive strongly deleterious variation due to these mutations being hidden from selection in the heterozygous state. As a result, when large populations contract, they experience a substantially elevated risk of extinction after these strongly deleterious mutations are exposed by inbreeding. Moreover, we demonstrate that, although genetic rescue is broadly effective as a means to reduce extinction risk, its effectiveness can be greatly increased by drawing migrants from small or moderate-sized source populations rather than large source populations due to smaller populations harboring lower levels of recessive strongly deleterious variation. Our findings challenge the traditional conservation paradigm that focuses on maximizing genetic diversity in small populations in favor of a view that emphasizes minimizing strongly deleterious variation. These insights have important implications for managing small and isolated populations in the increasingly fragmented landscape of the Anthropocene.

AB The deep sea plays a critical role in global climate regulation through uptake and storage of heat and carbon dioxide. However, this regulating service causes warming, acidification and deoxygenation of deep waters, leading to decreased food availability at the seafloor. These changes and their projections are likely to affect productivity, biodiversity and distributions of deep-sea fauna, thereby compromising key ecosystem services. Understanding how climate change can lead to shifts in deep-sea species distributions is critically important in developing management measures. We used environmental niche modelling along with the best available species occurrence data and environmental parameters to model habitat suitability for key cold-water coral and commercially important deep-sea fish species under present-day (1951-2000) environmental conditions and to project changes under severe, high emissions future (2081-2100) climate projections (RCP8.5 scenario) for the North Atlantic Ocean. Our models projected a decrease of 28%-100% in suitable habitat for cold-water corals and a shift in suitable habitat for deep-sea fishes of 2.0 degrees-9.9 degrees towards higher latitudes. The largest reductions in suitable habitat were projected for the scleractinian coral Lophelia pertusa and the octocoral Paragorgia arborea, with declines of at least 79% and 99% respectively. We projected the expansion of suitable habitat by 2100 only for the fishes Helicolenus dactylopterus and Sebastes mentella (20%-30%), mostly through northern latitudinal range expansion. Our results projected limited climate refugia locations in the North Atlantic by 2100 for scleractinian corals (30%-42% of present-day suitable habitat), even smaller refugia locations for the octocorals Acanella arbuscula and Acanthogorgia armata (6%-14%), and almost no refugia for P. arborea. Our results emphasize the need to understand how anticipated climate change will affect the distribution of deep-sea species including commercially important fishes and foundation species, and highlight the importance of identifying and preserving climate refugia for a range of area-based planning and management tools.

AB Movement is a trait of fundamental importance in ecosystems subject to frequent disturbances, such as fire-prone ecosystems. Despite this, the role of movement in facilitating responses to fire has received little attention. Herein, we consider how animal movement interacts with fire history to shape species distributions. We consider how fire affects movement between habitat patches of differing fire histories that occur across a range of spatial and temporal scales, from daily foraging bouts to infrequent dispersal events, and annual migrations. We review animal movements in response to the immediate and abrupt impacts of fire, and the longer-term successional changes that fires set in train. We discuss how the novel threats of altered fire regimes, landscape fragmentation, and invasive species result in suboptimal movements that drive populations downwards. We then outline the types of data needed to study animal movements in relation to fire and novel threats, to hasten the integration of movement ecology and fire ecology. We conclude by outlining a research agenda for the integration of movement ecology and fire ecology by identifying key research questions that emerge from our synthesis of animal movements in fire-prone ecosystems.

AB Land subsidence caused by land use change and overexploitation of groundwater is an example of mismanagement of natural resources, yet subsidence remains difficult to predict. In this study, the relationship between land subsidence features and geo-environmental factors is investigated by comparing two machine learning algorithms (MLA): maximum entropy (MaxEnt) and genetic algorithm rule-set production (GARP) algorithms in the Kashmar Region, Iran. Land subsidence features (N = 79) were mapped using field surveys. Land use, lithology, the distance from traditional groundwater abstraction systems (Qanats), from afforestation projects, from neighboring faults, and the drawdown of groundwater level (DGL) (1991-2016) were used as predictive variables. Jackknife resampling showed that DGL, distance from afforestation projects, and distance from Qanat systems are major factors influencing land subsidence, with geology and faults being less important. The GARP algorithm outperformed the MaxEnt algorithm for all performance metrics. The performance of both models, as measured by the area under the receiver-operator characteristic curve (AUROC), decreased from 88.9-94.4% to 82.5-90.3% when DGL was excluded as a predictor, though the performance of GARP was still good to excellent even without DGL. MLAs produced maps of subsidence risk with acceptable accuracy, both with and without data on groundwater drawdown, suggesting that MLAs can usefully inform efforts to manage subsidence in data scarce regions, though the highest accuracy requires data on changes in groundwater level.

AB Plants operate along a continuum of stringency of regulation of plant water potential from isohydry to anisohydry. However, most metrics and proxies of plant iso/anisohydric behavior have been developed from limited sets of site-specific experiments. Understanding the underlying mechanisms that determine species' operating ranges along this continuum, independent of site and growing conditions, remains challenging. We compiled a global database to assess the global patterns of metrics and proxies of plant iso/anisohydry and then explored some of the underlying functional traits and trade-offs associated with stringency of regulation that determines where species operate along the continuum. Our results showed that arid and semi-arid biomes were associated with greater anisohydry than more mesic biomes, and angiosperms showed marginally greater anisohydry than gymnosperms. Leaf water potential at the turgor loss point (psi(tlp)) and wood density were the two most powerful proxies for ranking the degree of plant iso/anisohydry for a wide range of species and biomes. Both of these simple traits can be easily and rapidly determined, and therefore show promise for a priori mapping and understanding of the global distribution pattern of the degree of plant iso/anisohydry. Generally, the most anisohydric species had the most negative values of psi(tlp) and highest wood density, greatest resistance to embolism, lowest hydraulic capacitance and lowest leaf-specific hydraulic conductivity of their branches. Wood density in particular appeared to be central to a coordinated series of traits, trade-offs and behaviors along a continuum of iso/anisohydry. Quantification of species' operating ranges along a continuum of iso/anisohydry and identification of associated trade-offs among functional traits may hold promise for mechanistic modeling of species-specific responses to the anticipated more frequent and severe droughts under global climate change scenarios.

AB After replanting apple (Malus domestica Borkh.) on the same site severe growth suppressions, and a decline in yield and fruit quality are observed in all apple producing areas worldwide. The causes of this complex phenomenon, called apple replant disease (ARD), are only poorly understood up to now which is in part due to inconsistencies in terms and methodologies. Therefore we suggest the following definition for ARD: ARD describes a harmfully disturbed physiological and morphological reaction of apple plants to soils that faced alterations in their (micro-) biome due to the previous apple cultures. The underlying interactions likely have multiple causes that extend beyond common analytical tools in microbial ecology. They are influenced by soil properties, faunal vectors, and trophic cascades, with genotype-specific effects on plant secondary metabolism, particularly phytoalexin biosynthesis. Yet, emerging tools allow to unravel the soil and rhizosphere (micro-) biome, to characterize alterations of habitat quality, and to decipher the plant reactions. Thereby, deep insights into the reactions taking place at the root rhizosphere interface will be gained. Counteractions are suggested, taking into account that culture management should emphasize on improving soil microbial and faunal diversity as well as habitat quality rather than focus on soil disinfection.

AB Plants adopt a variety of life history strategies to succeed in the Earth's diverse environments. Using functional traits which are defined as morphological, biochemical, physiological, or phonological characteristics measurable at the individual level, plants are classified according to their species' adaptative strategies, more than their taxonomy, from fast growing plant species to slower-growing conservative species. These different strategies probably influence the input and output of carbon (C)-resources, from the assimilation of carbon by photosynthesis to its release in the rhizosphere soil via root exudation. However, while root exudation was known to mediate plant-microbe interactions in the rhizosphere, it was not used as functional trait until recently. Here, we assess whether root exudate levels are useful plant functional traits in the classification of plant nutrient-use strategies and classical trait syndromes? For this purpose, we conducted an experiment with six grass species representing along a gradient of plant resource-use strategies, from conservative species, characterized by low biomass nitrogen (N) concentrations and a long lifespans, to exploitative species, characterized by high rates of photosynthesis and rapid rates of N acquisition. Leaf and root traits were measured for each grass and root exudate rate for each planted soil sample. Classical trait syndromes in plant ecology were found for leaf and root traits, with negative relationships observed between specific leaf area and leaf dry matter content or between specific root length and root dry matter content. However, a new root trait syndrome was also found with root exudation levels correlating with plant resource-use strategy patterns, specifically, between root exudation rate and root dry matter content. We therefore propose root exudation rate can be used as a key functional trait in plant ecology studies and plant strategy classification.

AB Biological fixation of atmospheric dinitrogen (N-2) is an important process that replenishes biologically available nitrogen (N) in soil and helps minimize the use of inorganic N fertilizer in agricultural ecosystems. Diazotrophs are key fixers of atmospheric N-2 in a range of soil types, however, there is uncertainty about how they respond to long-term fertilization. Here, using the nifH gene as a molecular marker, we investigated the long-term effects of inorganic and organic fertilization on diazotroph abundance and community structure in an acidic Ultisol. The field experiment ran for 27 years and comprised seven treatments: no fertilization (control); inorganic NPK fertilizer (N); inorganic NPK fertilizer + lime (CaCO3) (NL); inorganic NPK fertilizer + peanut straw (NPS); inorganic NPK fertilizer + rice straw (NRS); inorganic NPK fertilizer + radish (NR); and inorganic NPK fertilizer + pig manure (NPM). Long-term application of fertilizer reduced the abundance and diversity of nifH gene compared with the control (P < 0.05), while lime and pig manure increased the inhibitory effects (P < 0.05). The abundance and diversity of nifH genes were negatively correlated with soil pH, indicating that increasing soil pH potentially affect N fixation ability in acidic Ultisols. Community structure of diazotrophs in the NPS, NRS, and NR treatments were similar and shared most operational taxonomic units (OTUs) with the N treatment, with only a minor difference to that of the control. Thus, there was no effect of plant residue types on diazotroph community structure. In contrast, the application of inorganic fertilizer + liming or pig manure altered the diazotroph community structure with shifts in the dominant genus, from Bradyrhizobiurn in the control to Azohydromonas in NL and Azospirillum in NPM. Soil pH was the key factor correlated with change in diazotroph community structure. Overall, our results suggested that regular use of lime or pig manure rather than different types of plant residue reduced the abundance and diversity and altered community structure of diazotrophs, that may potentially affect N fixation ability in acidic Ultisols.

AB Empirical studies and habitat suitability modeling project significant shifts in species distributions in response to climate change. Because habitat fragmentation can impede species range shifts, wildlife corridors may have increasing importance in enhancing climate resilience for species persistence. While habitat connectivity has been studied for over four decades, the design of connectivity specifically to facilitate species movement in response to climate change is a relatively new challenge. We conducted a systematic review of 116 relevant papers from 1996-2017. Research focused on assessing the utility of habitat connectivity for climate change adaptation by species (N = 29) and modeling and mapping climate-wise connectivity for planning purposes (N = 55). Others addressed fundamental questions of connectivity related to climate adaptation (N = 31). Based on empirical data and computer simulations examining species range shifts in response to climate change at leading edges of current distributions; it is clear that large protected areas connected through linkages, and stepping stones embedded in a permeable matrix promote population persistence and facilitate range expansion. We identified 13 approaches to modeling climate-wise connectivity based on either focal species or landscape structure. When prioritizing areas for connectivity conservation, approaches include focusing on connecting areas of low climate velocity, refugia, climate analogs, or linking current to future suitable habitats. Riparian corridors should be considered in connectivity plans because of their importance as natural movement corridors, climate gradients, and refugia. Guidance is provided on selecting the best methods for connectivity design depending on the objectives, available data, and landscape context. Future research needs to evaluate the functionality of climate-wise connectivity models for facilitating range shifts and compare connectivity outcomes across modeling approaches.

AB There is global interest in increasing the complexity of urban ecosystems to benefit both people and nature in cities. However, to successfully plan for and manage more complex landscapes greater attention is needed on understanding the complementary role of different types of green spaces in cities. Wild spaces occur in many forms across the landscape. In this paper, we discuss the different social and ecological roles that wild urban spaces play in our cities, and how they vary across space and time. We then assess the role and benefits of wild urban spaces in relation to other types of green space. Wild spaces are spatially and temporally diverse, and can act as refuges when other green spaces are not available. Many important differences exist in the composition, structure and management of wild spaces in comparison with other kinds of green space that drive their unique contribution to urban ecosystems. This discussion paper highlights these differences, and brings together knowledge of the role of wild spaces in urban landscapes from a multidisciplinary perspective.

AB Plant roots can be very effective in stabilizing the soil against concentrated flow erosion. So far, most research on the erosion-reducing potential of plant roots was conducted on loamy soils. However susceptible to incisive erosion processes, at present, no research exists on the effectiveness of plant roots in reducing concentrated flow erosion rates in sandy soils. Therefore, the prime objective of this study was to assess the erosion-reducing potential of both fibrous and tap roots in sandy soils. Furthermore, we investigated potential effects of root diameter, soil texture and dry soil bulk density on the erosion-reducing potential of plant roots. Therefore, flume experiments conducted on sandy soils (this study) were compared with those on sandy loam and silt loam soils (using the same experimental set up). Results showed that plant roots were very efficient in reducing concentrated flow erosion rates in sandy soils compared to root-free bare soils. Furthermore, our results confirmed that fibrous roots were more effective compared to (thick) tap roots. Dry soil bulk density and soil texture also played a significant role. As they were both related to soil cohesion, the results of this study suggested that the effectiveness of plant roots in controlling concentrated flow erosion rates depended on the apparent soil cohesion. The nature of this soil type effect depended on the root-system type: fine root systems were most effective in non-cohesive soils while tap root systems were most effective in cohesive soils. For soils permeated with a given amount of fibrous roots, an increase of soil bulk density seemed to hamper the effectiveness of roots to further increase soil cohesion and reduce erosion rates. In soils reinforced by tap root systems, the erosion-reducing power of the roots depended on sand content: the higher the percentage of sand, the smaller the erosion-reducing effect for a given amount of roots. This was attributed to more pronounced vortex erosion around the thicker tap roots in non-cohesive soils, increasing soil erosion rates. The results presented in this study could support practitioners to assess the likely erosion-reducing effects of plant root systems based on both root and soil characteristics.

AB 1. Functional traits mechanistically capture plant responses to environmental gradients as well as plant effects on ecosystem functioning. Yet most trait-based theory stems from terrestrial systems and extension to other habitats can provide new insights.
   2. Wetlands differ from terrestrial systems in conditions (e.g. soil water saturation, anoxia, pH extremes), plant adaptations (e.g. aerenchyma, clonality, ubiquity of bryophytes) and important processes (e.g. denitrification, peat accumulation, methane emission). Wetland plant adaptations and trait (co-)variation can be situated along major plant trait trade-off axes (e.g. the resource economics spectrum), but soil saturation represents a complex stress gradient beyond a simple extension of commonly studied water availability gradients.
   3. Traits that affect ecosystem functioning overlap with patterns in terrestrial systems. But wetland-specific traits that mediate plant effects on soil redox conditions, microbial communities and on water flow, as well as trait spectra of mosses, vary among wetland types.
   4. Synthesis. With increasing availability of quantitative plant traits a trait-based ecology of wetlands is emerging, with the potential to advance process-based understanding and prediction. We provide an interactive cause-and-effect framework that may guide research efforts to disentangle the multiple interacting processes involved in scaling from environmental conditions to ecosystem functioning via plant communities.

AB The future distribution of river fishes will be jointly affected by climate and land use changes forcing species to move in space. However, little is known whether fish species will be able to keep pace with predicted climate and land use-driven habitat shifts, in particular in fragmented river networks. In this study, we coupled species distribution models (stepwise boosted regression trees) of 17 fish species with species-specific models of their dispersal (fish dispersal model FIDIMO) in the European River Elbe catchment. We quantified (i) the extent and direction (up-vs. downstream) of predicted habitat shifts under coupled moderate and severe climate and land use change scenarios for 2050, and (ii) the dispersal abilities of fishes to track predicted habitat shifts while explicitly considering movement barriers (e.g., weirs, dams). Our results revealed median net losses of suitable habitats of 24 and 94 river kilometers per species for the moderate and severe future scenarios, respectively. Predicted habitat gains and losses and the direction of habitat shifts were highly variable among species. Habitat gains were negatively related to fish body size, i.e., suitable habitats were projected to expand for smaller-bodied fishes and to contract for larger-bodied fishes. Moreover, habitats of lowland fish species were predicted to shift downstream, whereas those of headwater species showed upstream shifts. The dispersal model indicated that suitable habitats are likely to shift faster than species might disperse. In particular, smaller-bodied fish (<200mm) seem most vulnerable and least able to track future environmental change as their habitat shifted most and they are typically weaker dispersers. Furthermore, fishes and particularly larger-bodied species might substantially be restricted by movement barriers to respond to predicted climate and land use changes, while smaller-bodied species are rather restricted by their specific dispersal ability.

AB The distribution of fitness effects (DFE) encompasses the fraction of deleterious, neutral, and beneficial mutations. It conditions the evolutionary trajectory of populations, as well as the rate of adaptive molecular evolution (alpha). Inferring DFE and a from patterns of polymorphism, as given through the site frequency spectrum (SFS) and divergence data, has been a longstanding goal of evolutionary genetics. A widespread assumption shared by previous inference methods is that beneficial mutations only contribute negligibly to the polymorphism data. Hence, a DFE comprising only deleterious mutations tends to be estimated from SFS data, and alpha is then predicted by contrasting the SFS with divergence data from an outgroup. We develop a hierarchical probabilistic framework that extends previous methods to infer DFE and alpha from polymorphism data alone. We use extensive simulations to examine the performance of our method. While an outgroup is still needed to obtain an unfolded SFS, we show that both a DFE, comprising both deleterious and beneficial mutations, and alpha can be inferred without using divergence data. We also show that not accounting for the contribution of beneficial mutations to polymorphism data leads to substantially biased estimates of the DFE and alpha. We compare our framework with one of the most widely used inference methods available and apply it on a recently published chimpanzee exome data set.

AB Large-domain species distribution models (SDMs) fail to identify microrefugia, as they are based on climate estimates that are either too coarse or that ignore relevant topographic climate-forcing factors. Climate station data are considered inadequate to produce such estimates, a viewpoint we challenge here. Using climate stations and topographic data, we developed three sets of large-domain (450 000 km(2)), fine-grain (50m) temperature grids accounting for different levels of topographic complexity.
   Using these fine-grain grids and the Worldclim data, we fitted SDMs for 78 alpine species over Sweden, and assessed over-versus underestimations of local extinction and area of microrefugia by comparing modelled distributions at species' rear edges. Accounting for well-known topographic climate-forcing factors improved our ability to model fine-scale climate, despite using only climate station data. This approach captured the effect of cool air pooling, distance to sea, and relative humidity on local-scale temperature, but the effect of solar radiation could not be accurately accounted for. Predicted extinction rate decreased with increasing spatial resolution of the climate models and with increasing number of topographic climate-forcing factors accounted for. About half of the microrefugia detected in the most topographically complete models were not detected in the coarser SDMs and in the models calibrated from climate variables extracted from elevation only.
   Although major limitations remain, climate station data can potentially be used to produce fine-grain topoclimate grids, opening up the opportunity to model local-scale ecological processes over large domains. Accounting for the topographic complexity encountered within landscapes permits the detection of microrefugia that would otherwise remain undetected. Topographic heterogeneity is likely to have a massive impact on species persistence, and should be included in studies on the effects of climate change.

AB Fire is a natural disturbance in savannas, and defines vegetation physiognomy and structure, often influencing species diversity. Fire activity is determined by a wide range of factors, including long and short term climatic conditions, climate seasonality, wind speed and direction, topography, and fuel biomass. In Brazil, fire shapes the structure and composition of cerrado savannas, and the impact of fire on vegetation dynamics is well explored, but the drivers of variation in fire disturbance across landscapes and over time are still poorly understood. We reconstructed 31 years of fire occurrence history in the Serra do Cipo region, a highly-diverse cerrado landscape, located in the southern portion of the Espinhaco mountain range, state of Minas Gerais, Southeastern Brazil. We mapped burn scars using a time series of Landsat satellite images from 1984 to 2014. Our questions were 1) How does fire occurrence vary in time and space across the Serra do Cipo cerrado landscape? 2) Which climatic drivers may explain the spatial and inter-annual variation in fire occurrence on this landscape? 3) Is fire occurrence in this cerrado landscape moisture-limited or fuel-limited? We evaluated the inter-annual variation and distribution of burned areas, and used linear models to explain this variation in terms of rainfall amount (determinant of fuel load production), seasonal rainfall distribution (determinant of dry fuel availability), abnormality of precipitation (Standardized Precipitation Index - SPI), and vegetation type (Enhanced Vegetation Index - EVI). Contrary to our expectations, annual rainfall volume was weakly and negatively correlated with burned area, and the strongest predictor of burned area was drought during the ignition season. The length of the dry season and the distribution of rain along the season determined ignition probability, increasing fire occurrence during the driest periods. We conclude that the mountain cerrado vegetation at Serra do Cipo has a moisture-dependent fire regime, in contrast to the fuel-dependent fire regimes described for African savannas. These findings imply that savannas at different continents may have different recovery and resilience capabilities when subjected to changes in the fire regime, caused by direct anthropogenic activities or indirectly through climatic changes. The possible effects of these changes on cerrado landscapes are still unknown, and future studies should investigate if currently observed fire regimes have positive or negative impacts on vegetation diversity, recovery, resilience and phenology, thus helping managers to include fire management as conservation measure.

AB Permafrost soils contain more than 1300 Pg of carbon (C), twice the amount of C in the atmosphere. Temperatures in higher latitudes are increasing, inducing permafrost thaw and subsequent microbial decomposition of previously frozen C, which will most likely feed back to climate warming through release of the greenhouse gases CO2 and CH4. Understanding the temperature sensitivity (Q(10)) and dynamics of soil organic matter (SOM) decomposition under warming is essential to predict the future state of the climate system. Alaskan tundra soils from the discontinuous permafrost zone were exposed to in situ experimental warming for two consecutive winters, increasing soil temperature by 2.3 degrees C down to 40 cm in the soil profile. Soils obtained at three depths (0-15, 15-25 and 45-55 cm) from the experimental warming site were incubated under aerobic conditions at 15 degrees C and 25 degrees C over 365 days in the laboratory. Carbon fluxes were measured periodically and dynamics of SOM decomposition, C pool sizes, and decay rates were estimated. Q(10) was estimated using both a short-term temperature manipulation (Q(10-ST)) performed at 14,100 and 280 days of incubation and via the equal C method (Q(10-EC), ratio of time taken for a soil to respire a given amount of degrees C), calculated continuously. At the same time points, functional diversities of the soil microbial communities were monitored for all incubation samples using a microbial functional gene array, GeoChip 5.0. Each array contains over 80,000 probes targeting microbial functional genes involved in biogeochemical cycling of major nutrients, remediation strategies, pathogenicity and other important environmental functions. Of these, over 20,000 probes target genes involved in the degradation of varying C substrates and can be used, to quantify the relative gene abundances and functional gene diversities related to soil organic matter turnover. The slow decomposing C pool (C-S), which represented close to 95% of total C in the top 25 cm soils, had a higher Q(10) than the fast decomposing C pool (C-F) and also dominated the total amount of C released by the end of the incubation. Overall, C-S had temperature sensitivities of Q(10-ST) = 2.55 +/- 0.03 and Q(10-EC) = 2.19 +/- 0.13, while the CF had a temperature sensitivity of Q10-EC = 1.16 +/- 0.30. In contrast to the 15 degrees C incubations, the 25 degrees C microbial communities showed reduced diversities of C-degradation functional genes in the early stage of the incubations. However, as the incubations continued the 25 degrees C communities more closely paralleled the 15 degrees C communities with respect to the detection of microbial genes utilized in the degradation of labile to recalcitrant C substrates. Two winter seasons of experimental warming did not affect the dynamics and temperature sensitivity of SOM decomposition or the microbial C-degradation genes during incubation. However, under the projected sustained warming attributable to climate change, we might expect increased contribution of C-S to organic matter decomposition. Because of the higher Q(10) and the large pool size of C-S, increased soil organic matter release under warmer temperatures will contribute towards accelerating climate change. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: Plasmodium knowlesi is a zoonotic pathogen, transmitted among macaques and to humans by anopheline mosquitoes. Information on P. knowlesi malaria is lacking in most regions so the first step to understand the geographical distribution of disease risk is to define the distributions of the reservoir and vector species.
   Methods: We used macaque and mosquito species presence data, background data that captured sampling bias in the presence data, a boosted regression tree model and environmental datasets, including annual data for land classes, to predict the distributions of each vector and host species. We then compared the predicted distribution of each species with cover of each land class.
   Results: Fine-scale distribution maps were generated for three macaque host species (Macaca fascicularis, M. nemestrina and M. leonina) and two mosquito vector complexes (the Dirus Complex and the Leucosphyrus Complex). The Leucosphyrus Complex was predicted to occur in areas with disturbed, but not intact, forest cover (> 60 % tree cover) whereas the Dirus Complex was predicted to occur in areas with 10-100 % tree cover as well as vegetation mosaics and cropland. Of the macaque species, M. nemestrina was mainly predicted to occur in forested areas whereas M. fascicularis was predicted to occur in vegetation mosaics, cropland, wetland and urban areas in addition to forested areas.
   Conclusions: The predicted M. fascicularis distribution encompassed a wide range of habitats where humans are found. This is of most significance in the northern part of its range where members of the Dirus Complex are the main P. knowlesi vectors because these mosquitoes were also predicted to occur in a wider range of habitats. Our results support the hypothesis that conversion of intact forest into disturbed forest (for example plantations or timber concessions), or the creation of vegetation mosaics, will increase the probability that members of the Leucosphyrus Complex occur at these locations, as well as bringing humans into these areas. An explicit analysis of disease risk itself using infection data is required to explore this further. The species distributions generated here can now be included in future analyses of P. knowlesi infection risk.

AB Management of human activities which impact the seafloor in the deep ocean is becoming increasingly important as bottom trawling and exploration for minerals, oil, and gas continue to extend into regions where fragile ecosystems containing habitat-forming deep-sea corals and sponges may be found. Spatial management of these vulnerable marine ecosystems requires accurate knowledge of their distribution. Predictive habitat suitability modelling, using species presence data and a suite of environmental predictor variables, has emerged as a useful tool for inferring distributions outside of known areas. However, validation of model predictions is typically performed with non-independent data. In this study, we describe the results of habitat suitability models constructed for four deep-sea reef-forming coral species across a large region of the South Pacific Ocean using MaxEnt and Boosted Regression Tree modelling approaches. In order to validate model predictions we conducted a photographic survey on a set of seamounts in an un-sampled area east of New Zealand. The likelihood of habitat suitable for reef-forming corals on these seamounts was predicted to be variable, but very high in some regions, particularly where levels of aragonite saturation, dissolved oxygen, and particulate organic carbon were optimal. However, the observed frequency of coral occurrence in analyses of survey photographic data was much lower than expected, and patterns of observed versus predicted coral distribution were not highly correlated. The poor performance of these broad-scale models is attributed to lack of recorded species absences to inform the models, low precision of global bathymetry models, and lack of data on the geomorphology and substrate of the seamounts at scales appropriate to the modelled taxa. This demonstrates the need to use caution when interpreting and applying broad-scale, presence-only model results for fisheries management and conservation planning in data poor areas of the deep sea. Future improvements in the predictive performance of broad-scale models will rely on the continued advancement in modelling of environmental predictor variables, refinements in modelling approaches to deal with missing or biased inputs, and incorporation of true absence data.

AB Marine pelagic ecosystems present fascinating opportunities for ecological investigation but pose important methodological challenges for sampling. Active acoustic techniques involve producing sound and receiving signals from organisms and other water column sources, offering the benefit of high spatial and temporal resolution and, via integration into different platforms, the ability to make measurements spanning a range of spatial and temporal scales. As a consequence, a variety of questions concerning the ecology of pelagic systems lend themselves to active acoustics, ranging from organism-level investigations and physiological responses to the environment to ecosystem-level studies and climate. As technologies and data analysis methods have matured, the use of acoustics in ecological studies has grown rapidly. We explore the continued role of active acoustics in addressing questions concerning life in the ocean, highlight creative applications to key ecological themes ranging from physiology and behavior to biogeography and climate, and discuss emerging avenues where acoustics can help determine how pelagic ecosystems function.

AB Plant trait diversity in many vegetation models is crudely represented using a discrete classification of a handful of 'plant types' (named plant functional types; PFTs). The parameterization of PFTs reflects mean properties of observed plant traits over broad categories ignoring most of the inter-and intraspecific plant trait variability.
   Taking advantage of a multivariate leaf-trait distribution (leaf economics spectrum), as well as documented plant drought strategies, we generate an ensemble of hypothetical species with coordinated attributes, rather than using few PFTs. The behavior of these proxy species is tested using a mechanistic ecohydrological model that translates plant traits into plant performance. Simulations are carried out for a range of climates representative of different elevations and wetness conditions in the European Alps. Using this framework we investigate the sensitivity of ecosystem response to plant trait diversity and compare it with the sensitivity to climate variability.
   Plant trait diversity leads to highly divergent vegetation carbon dynamics (fluxes and pools) and to a lesser extent water fluxes (transpiration). Abiotic variables, such as soil water content and evaporation, are only marginally affected.
   These results highlight the need for revising the representation of plant attributes in vegetation models. Probabilistic approaches, based on observed multivariate whole-plant trait distributions, provide a viable alternative.

AB Spatial capture-recapture (SCR) models are a relatively recent development in quantitative ecology, and they are becoming widely used to model density in studies of animal populations using camera traps, DNA sampling and other methods which produce spatially explicit individual encounter information. One of the core assumptions of SCR models is that individuals possess home ranges that are spatially stationary during the sampling period. For many species, this assumption is unlikely to be met and, even for species that are typically territorial, individuals may disperse or exhibit transience at some life stages. In this paper we first conduct a simulation study to evaluate the robustness of estimators of density under ordinary SCR models when dispersal or transience is present in the population. Then, using both simulated and real data, we demonstrate that such models can easily be described in the BUGS language providing a practical framework for their analysis, which allows us to evaluate movement dynamics of species using capture-recapture data. We find that while estimators of density are extremely robust, even to pathological levels of movement (e.g., complete transience), the estimator of the spatial scale parameter of the encounter probability model is confounded with the dispersal/transience scale parameter. Thus, use of ordinary SCR models to make inferences about density is feasible, but interpretation of SCR model parameters in relation to movement should be avoided. Instead, when movement dynamics are of interest, such dynamics should be parameterized explicitly in the model.

This study investigates the catch composition of the Ecuadorian artisanal fishery for large pelagic fishes, including aspects of its spatio-temporal dynamics. The analyses of this study are based on the most extensive dataset available to date for this fishery: a total of 106,963 trip-landing inspection records collected at its five principal ports during 2008. 2012. Ecuadorian artisanal fisheries remove a substantial amount of biomass from the upper trophic-level predatory fish community of the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean. It is estimated that at least 135 thousand metric tons (mt) (about 15.5 million fish) were landed in the five principal ports during the study period. The great novelty of Ecuadorian artisanal fisheries is the "oceanic-artisanal" fleet component, which consists of mother-ship (nodriza) boats with their towed fiber-glass skiffs (fibras) operating with pelagic longlines. This fleet has fully expanded into oceanic waters as far offshore as 100 degrees W, west of the Galapagos Archipelago. It is estimated that nodriza operations produce as much as 80% of the total catches of the artisanal fishery. The remainder is produced by independent fibras operating in inshore waters with pelagic longlines and/or surface gillnets. A multivariate regression tree analysis was used to investigate spatio-environmental effects on the nodriza fleet (n = 6,821 trips). The catch species composition of the nodriza fleet is strongly influenced by the northwesterly circulation of the Humboldt Current along the coast of Peru and its associated cold waters masses. The target species and longline gear-type used by nodrizas change seasonally with the incursion of cool waters (< 25 degrees C) from the south and offshore. During this season, dolphinfish (Coryphaena hippurus) dominates the catches. However, in warmer waters, the fishery changes to tuna-billfish-shark longline gear and the catch composition becomes much more diverse.

AB Leaf photosynthetic CO2 responses can provide insight into how major nutrients, such as phosphorus (P), constrain leaf CO2 assimilation rates (A(net)). However, triose-phosphate limitations are rarely employed in the classic photosynthesis model and it is uncertain as to what extent these limitations occur in field situations. In contrast to predictions from biochemical theory of photosynthesis, we found consistent evidence in the field of lower A(net) in high [CO2] and low [O-2] than at ambient [O-2]. For 10 species of trees and shrubs across a range of soil P availability in Australia, none of them showed a positive response of A(net) at saturating [CO2] (i.e. A(max)) to 2kPa O-2. Three species showed >20% reductions in A(max) in low [O-2], a phenomenon potentially explained by orthophosphate (P-i) savings during photorespiration. These species, with largest photosynthetic capacity and P-i>2mmol Pm-2, rely the most on additional P-i made available from photorespiration rather than species growing in P-impoverished soils. The results suggest that rarely used adjustments to a biochemical photosynthesis model are useful for predicting A(max) and give insight into the biochemical limitations of photosynthesis rates at a range of leaf P concentrations. Phosphate limitations to photosynthetic capacity are likely more common in the field than previously considered.

AB The sensitivity of photosynthetic metabolism to temperature has been identified as a key uncertainty for projecting the magnitude of the terrestrial feedback on future climate change. While temperature responses of photosynthetic capacities have been comparatively well investigated in temperate species, the responses of tropical tree species remain unexplored. We compared the responses of seedlings of native cold-adapted tropical montane rainforest tree species with those of exotic warm-adapted plantation species, all growing in an intermediate temperature common garden in Rwanda. Leaf gas exchange responses to carbon dioxide (CO2) at different temperatures (20-40 degrees C) were used to assess the temperature responses of biochemical photosynthetic capacities. Analyses revealed a lower optimum temperature for photosynthetic electron transport rates than for Rubisco carboxylation rates, along with lower electron transport optima in the native cold-adapted than in the exotic warm-adapted species. The photosynthetic optimum temperatures were generally exceeded by daytime peak leaf temperatures, in particular in the native montane rainforest climax species. This study thus provides evidence of pronounced negative effects of high temperature in tropical trees and indicates high susceptibility of montane rainforest climax species to future global warming.

AB The prospect of increasing drought intensity in many river basins under climate change threatens the persistence of vulnerable freshwater species. Understanding how the traits of each species affect its resistance and resilience to drought may help to identify those species at most risk and elucidate the mechanisms by which impacts occur. I analysed macroinvertebrate monitoring data collected from rivers across Australia's Murray-Darling Basin (>10(6)km(2)) during the middle and later stages of the recent decade-long Millennium Drought and the initial post-drought period. I tested the ability of eight traits, expressing aspects of life history, diet and environmental tolerance, to explain changes in the broad-scale prevalence (the proportion of sites with observed presence) of macroinvertebrate families during and after the drought. The rate of basin-scale change in the riverine macroinvertebrate assemblage was least in the final stages of the drought. Immediately after the drought, the assemblage did not shift back towards its mid-drought state but instead moved further away. Eleven families that had a statistically significant fall in prevalence during the drought did not increase afterwards. Negative responses to drought were associated with slower maturation, absence of atmospheric respiration, high rheophily and low thermophily. Positive responses to cessation of drought were associated with having a holometabolous life cycle, greater requirements for dissolved oxygen, high rheophily and low thermophily. Because several traits were related to drought vulnerability, management to mitigate the adverse ecological effects of future droughts should consider a number of mechanisms by which drought has an effect. These include a loss of flowing water that supports rheophilous species, inadequate duration of wetting for species with a long aquatic phase, and effects of high temperature and hypoxia on species requiring cool conditions and well-aerated water. A revival of research on the life histories of freshwater invertebrate species and more information on oxygen requirements and temperature and desiccation tolerance are needed to improve our ability to predict the effects of drought.

AB The Arctic is experiencing rapid vegetation changes, such as shrub and tree line expansion, due to climate warming, as well as increased wetland variability due to hydrological changes associated with permafrost thawing. These changes are of global concern because changes in vegetation may increase tundra soil biogeochemical processes that would significantly enhance atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Predicting the latter will at least partly depend on knowing the structure, functional activities, and distributions of soil microbes among the vegetation types across Arctic landscapes. Here we investigated the bacterial and microeukaryotic community structures in soils from the four principal low Arctic tundra vegetation types: wet sedge, birch hummock, tall birch, and dry heath. Sequencing of rRNA gene fragments indicated that the wet sedge and tall birch communities differed significantly from each other and from those associated with the other two dominant vegetation types. Distinct microbial communities were associated with soil pH, ammonium concentration, carbon/nitrogen (C/N) ratio, and moisture content. In soils with similar moisture contents and pHs (excluding wet sedge), bacterial, fungal, and total eukaryotic communities were correlated with the ammonium concentration, dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) content, and C/N ratio. Operational taxonomic unit (OTU) richness, Faith's phylogenetic diversity, and the Shannon species-level index (H') were generally lower in the tall birch soil than in soil from the other vegetation types, with pH being strongly correlated with bacterial richness and Faith's phylogenetic diversity. Together, these results suggest that Arctic soil feedback responses to climate change will be vegetation specific not just because of distinctive substrates and environmental characteristics but also, potentially, because of inherent differences in microbial community structure.

AB There is a global trend in the depletion of transient reef fish spawning aggregations ("FSAs"), making them a primary target for management with marine protected areas (MPAs). Here, we review the observed and likely effectiveness of FSA MPAs, discuss how future studies could fill knowledge gaps, and provide recommendations for MPA design based on species' life history and behaviour, enforcement potential, and management goals. Modelling studies indicate that FSA MPAs can increase spawning-stock biomass and normalize sex ratio in protogynous fish populations, unless fishing mortality remains high outside protected FSA sites and spawning times. In the field, observations of no change or continued decline in spawning biomass are more common than population recovery. When empirical studies suggest that FSA MPAs may not benefit fish productivity or recovery, extenuating factors such as insufficient time since MPA creation, poor or lack of enforcement, inadequate design, and poorly defined management objectives are generally blamed rather than failure of the MPA concept. Results from both the empirical and modelling literature indicate that FSA MPAs may not improve exploitable biomass and fisheries yields; however, investigations are currently too limited to draw conclusions on this point. To implement effective FSA MPAs, additional modelling work, long-term monitoring programmes at FSA sites, and collections of fisheries-dependent data are required, with greater attention paid to the design and enforcement of area closures. We recommend a harmonized, adaptive approach that combines FSA MPA design with additional management measures to achieve explicitly stated objectives. Conservation objectives and, therefore, an overall reduction in mortality rates should be targeted first. Fisheries objectives build on conservation objectives, in that they require an overall reduction in mortality rates while maintaining sufficient access to exploitable biomass. Communication among researchers, regulatory agencies, park authorities, and fishers will be paramount for effective action, along with significant funds for implementation and enforcement.

AB The area of cadmium (Cd)-contaminated soil in China is increasing due to the rapid development of the Chinese economy. To ensure that the rice produced in China meets current food safety and quality standards, the current soil quality standards for paddy soils urgently need to be updated.
   We conducted a pot experiment with 19 representative paddy soils from different parts of China to study the effects of soil properties on bioaccumulation of Cd in rice grains. The experiment included a control, a low treatment concentration (0.3 mg kg(-1) for pH < 6.5 and 0.6 mg kg(-1) for pH a parts per thousand yenaEuro parts per thousand 6.5), and a high treatment concentration (0.6 mg kg(-1) for pH < 6.5 and 1.2 mg kg(-1) for pH a parts per thousand yenaEuro parts per thousand 6.5) of Cd salt added to soils.
   The results showed that the Cd content in grains of the control and low and high Cd treatments ranged from 0.021 to 0.14, 0.07 to 0.27, and 0.12 to 0.33 mg kg(-1), respectively. Stepwise multiple regression analysis indicated that soil pH and organic carbon (OC) content could explain over 60 % of the variance in the (log-transformed) bioaccumulation coefficient (BCF) of Cd in grains across soils. Aggregated boosted trees analysis showed that soil pH and OC were the main factors controlling Cd bioavailability in paddy soils. Validation of the models against data from recent literature indicated that they were able to accurately predict the BCF in paddy soils.
   These quantitative relationships between the BCF of Cd in grains and soil properties are helpful for developing soil-specific guidance on Cd safety threshold value for paddy soils.

TI Unusual Small Subunit That Is Not Expressed in Photosynthetic Cells

AB Rubisco small subunits (RbcSs) are encoded by a nuclear multigene family in plants. Five RbcS genes, OsRbcS1, OsRbcS2, OsRbcS3, OsRbcS4, and OsRbcS5, have been identified in rice (Oryza sativa). Among them, the amino acid sequence of OsRbcS1 differs notably from those of other rice RbcSs. Phylogenetic analysis showed that OsRbcS1 is genetically distant from other rice RbcS genes and more closely related to RbcS from a fern and two woody plants. Reverse transcription-PCR and promoter beta-glucuronidase analyses revealed that OsRbcS1 was not expressed in leaf blade, a major photosynthetic organ in rice, but was expressed in leaf sheath, culm, anther, and root central cylinder. In leaf blade of transgenic rice overexpressing OsRbcS1 and leaf sheath of nontransgenic rice, OsRbcS1 was incorporated into the Rubisco holoenzyme. Incorporation of OsRbcS1 into Rubisco increased the catalytic turnover rate and K-m for CO2 of the enzyme and slightly decreased the specificity for CO2, indicating that the catalytic properties were shifted to those of a high-activity type Rubisco. The CO2 assimilation rate at low CO2 partial pressure was decreased in overexpression lines but was not changed under ambient and high CO2 partial pressure compared with nontransgenic rice. Although the Rubisco content was increased, Rubisco activation state was decreased in overexpression lines. These results indicate that the catalytic properties of Rubisco can be altered by ectopic expression of OsRbcS1, with substantial effects on photosynthetic performance in rice. We believe this is the first demonstration of organ-specific expression of individual members of the RbcS gene family resulting in marked effects on Rubisco catalytic activity.

AB Widespread climate-induced habitat compression and reductions in biological production are beginning to alter food webs in tropical and subtropical oceans, but the effects on midtrophic level micronekton communities that support commercially important pelagic fishes are unclear. The predation habits of yellowfin tuna Thunnus albacares, a wide-ranging generalist predator with high energy requirements, provide rare insights into the distribution and availability of prey communities in pelagic regions. We used a modified classification tree approach to analyze spatial, temporal, environmental, and biological covariates explaining the predation patterns of 3362 yellowfin sampled across the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean (ETP) during two 2 yr periods occurring a decade apart. Persistent zoogeographical assemblages of prey were important only in relatively small subtropical regions at the extreme northern and southern ranges of the purseseine fishery for tunas. Prey biomass patterns for the majority of the samples over most of the ETP (6 degrees S to 17 degrees N, coast to 150 degrees W) were best explained by a tree partition distinguishing samples by sampling period, 1992 to 1994 and 2003 to 2005. The classification tree revealed that a major diet shift had transpired in the heart of the ETP. Yellowfin predation had changed from primarily larger epipelagic fish prey in the 1990s to a diverse array of smaller mesopelagic species and a crustacean that apparently had expanded its range in the 2000s. Partial dependence plots from the tree model showed range expansions previously described for some prey and unknown for other prey. Diet analysis of selected marine predators offers a practical means of monitoring prey communities poorly sampled by conventional methods.

AB Motivation: The advent of new sequencing technologies has led to increasing amounts of data being available to perform phylogenetic analyses, with genomic data giving rise to the field of phylogenomics. High-performance computing is becoming an indispensable research tool to fit complex evolutionary models, which take into account specific genomic properties, to large datasets. Here, we perform an extensive Bayesian phylogenetic model selection study, comparing codon and nucleotide substitution models, including codon position partitioning for nucleotide data as well gene-specific substitution models for both data types. For the best fitting partitioned models, we also compare independent partitioning with standard diffuse prior specification to conditional partitioning via hierarchical prior specification. To compare the different models, we use state-of-the-art marginal likelihood estimation techniques, including path sampling and stepping-stone sampling.
   Results: We show that a full codon model best describes the features of a whole mitochondrial genome dataset, consisting of 12 protein-coding genes, but only when each gene is allowed to evolve under a separate codon model. However, when using hierarchical prior specification for the partition-specific parameters instead of independent diffuse priors, codon position partitioned nucleotide models can still outperform standard codon models. We demonstrate the feasibility of fitting such a combination of complex models using the BEAGLE library for BEAST in combination with recent graphics cards. We argue that development and use of such models needs to be accompanied by state-of-the-art marginal likelihood estimators because the more traditional and computationally less demanding estimators do not offer adequate accuracy.

AB Geographical parthenogenesis describes the enigmatic phenomenon that asexual organisms have larger distribution areas than their sexual relatives, especially in previously glaciated areas. Classical models suggest temporary advantages to asexuality in colonization scenarios because of uniparental reproduction and clonality. We analyzed population genetic structure and self-fertility of the plant species Ranunculus kuepferi on 59 populations from the whole distribution area (European Alps, Apennines and Corsica). Amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs) and five microsatellite loci revealed individual genotypes for all populations and mostly insignificant differences between diploid sexuals and tetraploid apomicts in all measures of genetic diversity. Low frequencies of private AFLP fragments/simple sequence repeat alleles, and character incompatibility analyses suggest that facultative recombination explains best the unexpectedly high genotypic diversity of apomicts. STRUCTURE analyses using AFLPs revealed a higher number of partitions and a stronger geographical subdivision for diploids than for tetraploids, which contradicts expectations of standard gene flow models, but indicates a reduction of genetic structure in asexuals. Apomictic populations exhibited high admixture near the sexual area, but appeared rather uniform in remote areas. Bagging experiments and analyses of pollen tube growth confirmed self-fertility for pollen-dependent apomicts, but self-sterility for diploid sexuals. Facultative apomixis combines advantages of both modes of reproduction: uniparental reproduction allows for rapid colonization of remote areas, whereas facultative sexuality and polyploidy maintains genetic diversity within apomictic populations. The density dependence of outcrossing limits range expansions of sexual populations.

ID FRAMEWORK; SCALES; SEA
AB A consistent framework to address biodiversity, ecosystem services and their societal values is now established with the MEA (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment) and the TEEB (The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity). These and other studies point to the urgency in considering actions that can revert the process of degradation of biodiversity values and its supporting ecosystems. Safeguarding livelihoods is a common objective in ecosystem approaches as well as in strategic environmental assessment (SEA) effort to promote sustainability. Human activities, as direct and indirect development drivers, are crucial targets for SEA to have a strategic contribution in influencing priorities, by showing strategic reasons for change. Rather than keeping only a control and mitigation role on the assessment of effects and impacts of development on the environment, SEA has the capacity to understand the decisional and development context and to drive development opportunities into pathways that are inclusive of environmental and sustainability priorities. The development opportunities provided by ecosystem services can be explored in SEA through strategic approaches to enhance the value of the benefits and avoid the negative impact of human actions on ecosystem services. SENSU, a research team at IST-Portugal, advocates the strategic-based and collaborative oriented approach in SEA based on Partidario (2007) SEA framework of critical decision factors (CDF). A methodology to allow the consideration of ecosystem services in SEA is being developed and tested. This paper will share research advances on how ecosystem services can be incorporated into SEA as a fundamental component of strategic assessment in support of decision-making. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

AB Animal habitat selection is a process that functions at multiple, hierarchically structured spatial scales. Thus multi-scale analyses should be the basis for inferences about factors driving the habitat selection process. Vertebrate herbivores forage selectively on the basis of phytochemistry, but few studies have investigated the influence of selective foraging (i.e., fine-scale habitat selection) on habitat selection at larger scales. We tested the hypothesis that phytochemistry is integral to the habitat selection process for vertebrate herbivores. We predicted that habitats selected at three spatial scales would be characterized by higher nutrient concentrations and lower concentrations of plant secondary metabolites (PSMs) than unused habitats. We used the Greater Sage-Grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus), an avian herbivore with a seasonally specialized diet of sagebrush, to test our hypothesis. Sage-Grouse selected a habitat type (black sagebrush, Artemisia nova) with lower PSM concentrations than the alternative (Wyoming big sagebrush, A. tridentata wyomingensis). Within black sagebrush habitat, Sage-Grouse selected patches and individual plants within those patches that were higher in nutrient concentrations and lower in PSM concentrations than those not used. Our results provide the first evidence for multi-scale habitat selection by an avian herbivore on the basis of phytochemistry, and they suggest that phytochemistry may be a fundamental driver of habitat selection for vertebrate herbivores.

AB A suite of models was used to examine the links between climate, fuels and fire behaviour in dry eucalypt forests in south-eastern Australia. Predictions from a downscaled climate model were used to drive models of fuel amount, the moisture content of fuels and two models of forest fire behaviour at a location in western Sydney in New South Wales, Australia. We found that a warming and drying climate produced lower fine fuel amounts, but greater availability of this fuel to burn due to lower moisture contents. Changing fuel load had only a small effect on fuel moisture. A warmer, drier climate increased rate of spread, an important measure of fire behaviour. Reduced fuel loads ameliorated climate-induced changes in fire behaviour for one model. Sensitivity analysis of the other fire model showed that changes in fuel amount induced changes in fire behaviour of a similar magnitude to that caused directly by sensitivity to climate. Projection of changes in fire risk requires modelling of changes in vegetation as well as changes in climate. Better understanding of climate change effects on vegetation structure is required.

AB The monsoon tropics of northern Australia are a globally significant biodiversity hotspot, but its phylogeography is poorly known. A major challenge for this region is to understand the biogeographical processes that have shaped the distribution and diversity of taxa, without detailed knowledge of past climatic and environmental fluctuations. Although molecular data have great potential to address these questions, only a few species have been examined phylogeographically. Here, we use the widely distributed and abundant short-eared rock-wallaby (Petrogale brachyotis; n = 101), together with the sympatric monjon (P. burbidgei; n = 11) and nabarlek (P. concinna; n = 1), to assess historical evolutionary and biogeographical processes in northern Australia. We sequenced 1000 bp of mitochondrial DNA (control region, ND2) and 3000 bp of nDNA (BRCA1, ?-globin and two anonymous loci) to investigate phylogeographic structuring and delineate the time-scale of diversification within the region. Our results indicate multiple barriers between the Top End (Northern Territory) and Kimberley (Western Australia), which have caused divergence throughout the Plio-Pleistocene. Eight geographically discrete and genetically distinct lineages within the brachyotis group were identified, five of which are separated by major river valleys (Ord, Victoria, Daly), arid lowlands and discontinuous sandstone ranges. It is likely that these barriers have similarly influenced genetic structure in other monsoonal biota.

AB In general, species with large ecological amplitudes are equipped with high genetic diversities. In contrast, more specialised species with narrow ecological amplitudes show low levels of genetic diversity. Generalist species are mostly rather marginally affected by recent land-use changes; specialist can be supported by specific conservation measures. We argue that, in the light of Conservation Genetics, species being ecologically intermediate between these two extremes are the most seriously affected ones by recent environmental changes. Such species which formerly occurred in large population networks have to sustain their high level of genetic variability via gene flow. Today, species from the latter group are negatively affected by rapid habitat collapses causing sudden lacks of population interconnectivity. Therefore, species with intermediate habitat demands and originally high genetic diversity might be at highest risk due to inbreeding depressions. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Juvenile loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta) from Atlantic nesting populations migrate into the western Mediterranean, where they share feeding grounds with turtles originating in the Mediterranean. In this scenario, male-mediated gene flow may lead to the homogenization of these distant populations. To test this hypothesis, we genotyped 7 microsatellites from 56 Atlantic individuals sampled from feeding grounds in the western Mediterranean and then compared the observed allele frequencies with published data of 112 individuals from Mediterranean nesting beaches. Mediterranean populations were found to be genetically differentiated from the Atlantic stock reaching the western Mediterranean (F-st = 0.029, P < 0.001); therefore, the possible mating events between Atlantic and Mediterranean individuals are not sufficient to homogenize these 2 areas. The differentiation observed between these 2 areas demonstrates that microsatellites are sufficiently powerful for mixed stock analysis and that individual assignment (IA) tests can be performed in combination with mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) analysis. In a set of 197 individuals sampled in western Mediterranean feeding grounds, 87% were robustly assigned to Atlantic or Mediterranean groups with the combined marker, as compared with only 52% with mtDNA alone. These findings provide a new approach for tracking the movements of these oceanic migrants and have strong implications for the conservation of the species.

AB In this study we examined the importance of seasonal changes in habitat features and aquatic macroinvertebrate responses in temporary and perennial streams from two different catchments in the Western Mediterranean region in Spain. Macroinvertebrate sampling was spatially intensive to account for the relative frequency of meso- (i.e., riffles and pools) and micro-habitats (i.e., different mineral and organic-based substrata) at each site. Samples were collected at two distinctly different phases of the hydrograph: (1) during the flowing period, when pool-riffle sequences were well-established, and (2) during the dry phase, when only isolated pools were expected to occur in the temporary streams. During the dry season, both a reduction in the available total habitat and in microhabitat diversity in all sites studied was observed. As a result, taxon richness decreased in all streams, but more dramatically at temporary stream sites and particularly so in the infrequently remaining discontinuous riffles. Macroinvertebrate assemblages differed among catchments (i.e., geographical identity) and sites (perennial vs. temporary). Invertebrate differences were also strong within and among meso- and micro-habitats, particularly mineral and organic microhabitat patches, and differences were due to both loss of taxa from some habitats and some taxa exhibiting certain habitat affinities.

AB Questions: How can SDMs be adopted as a tool for forest management planning? Based on presence-absence data, which modelling techniques are appropriate to determine species potential distribution for forest management planning under climate change? Do species distribution models (SDMs) agree with expert knowledge about species distribution and species traits? How can forest researcher deal with distribution data of a species whose distribution is heavily affected by human impacts?
   Location: Bavaria (Southern Germany).
   Methods: We used SDMs based on the Second National Forest Inventory from 2002 (4 x 4 km grid) containing presence-absence data of tree species to identify species environment relationships ('Grinnellian niche'). As an example, the distribution of silver fir (Abies alba Mill.) was modelled. Site condition data of the plots were derived from solar radiation, climate and soil maps. Models applied were boosted regression trees (BRT) and generalised additive models (GAM). Model predictions were compared with an expert based evaluation of the potential natural vegetation and were run with a climate change scenario (WETTREG B1) to project future distribution of silver fir.
   Results: Both models discriminated well between presence and absence of silver fir but underestimated the potential distribution. The BRT model was more sensitive to local site conditions in the present data, but the GAM showed more generality. The truncated response curves and high uncertainties of predictions at the edge of the site spectrum indicated a low data density and that the data did not cover the whole niche space of silver fir. As indicated by validation with expert knowledge, the model output approached potential distribution by optimizing true positive predictions. The classification of SDMs output into risk classes allowed model evaluation and interpretation. Predictions of GAM and BRT under the climate change scenario showed high accordance and therefore, low uncertainty. Finally, large areas of Bavaria are described to have a high risk of silver fir cultivation in future.
   Conclusions: SDMs are especially interesting as a decision basis for forest management because some of the general limitations of static modelling approaches are not relevant in this context. Limitations of forest inventory data can be partially overcome by using information on the potential distribution of species. The transferability of the models to future scenarios strongly depends on the spectrum and range of the training data sets and the depicted functional relationships. In order to improve the models and reduce the uncertainties, we need to improve the soil data and cover the whole niche space of silver fir.

AB Question
   Are the patterns of alien conifer (Pinaceae, Cupressaceae) invasions different between continents, and how is invasion success influenced by commercial forestry practices?
   Location
   Temperate and subtropical countries and regions (n = 60) from five continents spanning both hemispheres.
   Methods
   We used generalized linear mixed models to test how continent identity, region area and use in commercial forestry affect probabilities of Pinaceae and Cupressaceae species to escape following introduction and cumulative logit regression models to assess how these predictors affect the likelihood that a species becomes naturalized or invasive.
   Results
   Sixty Pinaceae of a global total of 232 and 26 Cupressaceae of a total of 142 species have escaped from cultivation across the study regions examined. Average numbers of both alien Pinaceae and Cupressaceae species per region were highest in Oceania, followed by Africa. Moreover, the probability of alien Cupressaceae and Pinaceae becoming naturalized or invasive was particularly high in these two continents. For both families, species used in commercial forestry have a significantly higher probability of escape than those which are only introduced for ornamental or other purposes. In the case of Pinaceae, forestry species also become naturalized or invasive more frequently than non-forestry species, while no such effect was detectable for Cupressaceae.
   Conclusions
   We found that non-native conifers are more likely to escape from cultivation, naturalize and turn into invasive weeds on the continents of the Southern Hemisphere. In addition to this biogeographic signal, introduction effort strongly determines the behaviour of introduced Pinaceae, and less so, Cupressaceae. A clear conflict exists between the economic benefits of conifer forestry and the risks to the environment from invasions. Future expansion of commercial forestry should address spatial planning to ecosystems vulnerable to invasion and adopt comprehensive risk assessment procedures.

AB Leaf dry mass per area (LMA) is a composite parameter relating to a suite of structural traits that have the potential to influence photosynthesis. However, the extent to which each of these traits contributes to variation in LMA and photosynthetic rates is not well understood, especially at the high end of the LMA spectrum. In this study, the genus Banksia (Proteaceae) was chosen as a model group, and key structural traits such as LMA, leaf thickness, and density were measured in 49 species. Based on the leaf trait variation obtained, a subset of 18 species displaying a wide range in LMA of 134-507 g m(-2) was selected for analyses of relationships between leaf structural and photosynthetic characteristics. High LMA was associated with more structural tissue, lower mass-based chlorophyll and nitrogen concentrations, and therefore lower mass-based photosynthesis. In contrast, area-based photosynthesis did not correlate with LMA, despite mesophyll volume per area increasing with increases in LMA. Photosynthetic rate per unit mesophyll volume declined with increasing LMA, which is possibly associated with structural limitations and, to a lesser extent, with lower nitrogen allocation. Mesophyll cell wall thickness significantly increased with LMA, which would contribute to lower mesophyll conductance at high LMA. Photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency and the nitrogen allocation to Rubisco and thylakoids tended to decrease at high LMA. The interplay between anatomy and physiology renders area-based photosynthesis independent of LMA in Banksia species.

AB Extensive research has been conducted globally into conceptual frameworks for ecosystem services, the most notable being the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (Millennium ecosystem assessment: ecosystems and human well-being; a framework for assessment. World Resources Institute, Washington, DC, pp 51, 53-55, 2005). The South East Queensland (SEQ) Ecosystem Services Framework (Australia) aims to provide the tools to enable government, industry, business, researchers, non-government organizations and land managers to apply the concept of ecosystem services in their planning and management practices. This article describes the Framework and the process that has produced matrices and maps that identify and illustrate the linkages between ecosystems, ecosystem functions, ecosystem services and the community's well-being. The matrices and maps derived can identify areas in the region where the most ecosystem services are generated. This allows areas to be considered as valuable natural assets of the region, deserving appropriate protection measures or significant offsets if they are diminished or degraded in any way. Although the Framework requires further refinement and ongoing development, the process applied and the products produced has enabled decision makers to turn the concept of ecosystem services into practical application in SEQ.

The predictive performance of the CT and SVM models was assessed based on the percentage of Correctly Classified Instances (CCI) and Cohen's kappa statistics The results of the present study demonstrated that SVMs performed better than CTs Attribute weighing in SVMs could replace the application of genetic algorithms for input variable selection By weighing attributes. SVMs provided quantitative correlations between environmental variables and the occurrence of macroinvertebrates and thus allowed better ecological interpretation SVMs thus proved to have a high potential when applied for decision-making in the context of river restoration and conservation management (C) 2009 Elsevier B V All rights reserved

AB The effects of changes in the landscape and alteration of natural flow process on aquatic macroinvertebrate assemblages were investigated in 67 small-to-medium sized (15-526 km(2)) upland streams in the northeastern United States. Environmental characteristics that were found to be important in determining macroinvertebrate-assemblage composition include urbanization and concomitant changes in natural streamflow patterns. In particular, hydrologic attributes accounted for a significant proportion of the variability and were important in driving modifications to assemblage structure after natural environmental variability was extracted. For example, mean April flow accounted for the greatest amount of assemblage variability in any single multiple linear regression (MLR) model (65%) and duration of high flows accounted for a significant portion of the assemblage variability in the five, four and one-variable models (25, 26, and 23%, respectively). Seasonal predictability of low flow consistently accounted for a significant proportion of the assemblage variability in all but the two-variable (MLR) model. Significant (p < 0.05) bivariate flow-ecology response relations were established, especially for hydrologic measures that account for the frequency, duration, and magnitude of flow events, and these relations generally followed increasing or decreasing trends that would be expected given changes in stream hydrology. This study demonstrates that there are likely specific negative consequences to stream biotic integrity in northeastern streams as the result of hydrologic alteration associated with basin urbanization. Understanding the relations between hydrologic modification and aquatic assemblages will help efforts to set sustainable flow standards for protection of aquatic assemblages while providing water for human needs.

AB This paper presents a quantitative ecohydrological framework for predicting regional distribution patterns of woody species in dryland ecosystems. The framework is based on an existing stochastic model for the daily mass balance of water that represents the interactions between soils, climate, and vegetation. Individual species selection is based on an optimality trade-off hypothesis, which states that dryland vegetation patterns are constrained by maximization of water use and simultaneous minimization of water stress. The relative importance of water use and stress avoidance to the overall fitness of three Acacia species is determined from the heterogeneous basin, the Upper Ewaso Ng'iro river basin, of the central Kenya highlands. The model results indicate that overall fitness is more strongly influenced by water use than stress avoidance but that consideration of both stress avoidance and water use is critical to predicting basin-scale patterns of species distribution. We identify a linear trend in the frequency and intensity of storms with the same annual total using a basin-wide gauge precipitation dataset. After calibration, we apply the basin average linear trends in time for average rain per storm and storm arrival rates. The model results indicate the upslope migration of two species, Acacia tortilis and Acacia xanthophloea to areas with higher total rainfall. Lastly, we explore the modeled changes of species cover in the basin influenced by changes in rainfall total holding growing season rainfall variability constant and changes in growing season rainfall variability holding total rainfall constant. We find that changes in dryland species distribution patterns and relative abundance may be as sensitive to growing season rainfall variability as they are to changes in total rainfall amounts.

AB Combined action from over-harvesting and recent mass mortality events potentially linked to ongoing climate changes has led to new concerns for the conservation of shallow populations (5-60 m) of Corallium rubrum, an octocorallian that is mainly found in the Mediterranean Sea. The present study was designed to analyse population structure and relationships at different spatial scales (from 10s of meters to 100s of kilometres) with a focus on dispersal pattern. We also performed the first analysis of the distribution of genetic diversity using a comparative approach between regional-clusters and samples. Forty populations dwelling in four distinct regions between 14 and 60 m in depth were genotyped using 10 microsatellites. Our main results indicate (i) a generalized pair-sample differentiation combined with a weak structure between regional-clusters; (ii) the occurrence of isolation by distance at the global scale, but also within two of the three analysed regional-clusters; (iii) a high level of genetic diversity over the surveyed area with a heterogeneous distribution from regional-cluster to sample levels. The evolutionary consequences of these results are discussed and their management implications are provided.

AB Bluefish (Pomatomus saltatrix) has a worldwide distribution, being targeted by fishers all along its range, which includes the Brazilian coast. We formulated and checked hypotheses regarding bluefish diet, migration, and reproduction based on fishers' local ecological knowledge (LEK). We interviewed 49 experienced fishers (40 years and older) from five communities along the Brazilian coast and analyzed the diet and reproduction of 185 fish. According to fishers' LEK, the bluefish spawn mainly during the winter, migrate throughout year (from the South to North), and eat mainly small fish (Clupeidae and Engraulidae), plus shrimp and squid. The biological survey confirmed the hypothesis on bluefish diet (78% of fish with stomach contents had fish in their stomachs) but not that on reproduction: we observed larger fish and more fish with visible eggs during summer and autumn. Migratory movements mentioned by fishers agreed with literature data. Besides providing data to support conventional management decisions in the absence of biological surveys, our results and approach could help involve fishers in management, thus contributing to development of co-management systems more suitable to local conditions and to complex tropical fisheries.

ID GROUP DIVERSITY; PRICE EQUATION; COMPLEMENTARITY; PRODUCTIVITY;

AB Experiments that manipulate species richness and measure ecosystem functioning attempt to separate the effects of species richness (the number of species) from those of species identity. We introduce an experimental design that ensures that each species is selected the same number of times at each level of species richness. In combination with a linear model analysis, this approach is able to unambiguously partition the variance due to different species identities and the variance due to nonlinear species richness, a proxy measure for interactions among species. Our design and analysis provide several advantages over methods that are currently used. First, the linear model method has the potential to directly estimate the role of various ecological mechanisms (e.g., competition, facilitation) rather than the consequences of those mechanisms (e.g., the "complementarity effect"). Second, unlike other methods that are currently used, this one is able to estimate the impact of diversity when the contribution of individual species in a mixture is unknown.

AB Mitochondrial markers are still often used alone to identify evolutionary units, despite widespread evidence for processes such as incomplete lineage sorting or introgressive hybridization that may blur past population history. The combination of mitochondrial DNA data with other sources of information (morphology, nuclear genes) is a powerful tool to reveal when and why mitochondrial markers are potentially misleading. In this study, we evaluate the performance of mtDNA markers to unravel the evolutionary history of Spanish lizards from the Podarcis hispanicus species complex. We first uncover several cases of discordance between morphological and mitochondrial data in delimitation of taxa. To assess the origin of these discordances, we analysed the same populations using several independent nuclear loci. Both morphological and nuclear markers identified the same three evolutionary units in the region, while mitochondrial data revealed four deeply divergent lineages. We suggest here that the most likely scenario to explain this discordance is ancient mitochondrial introgression originating from a fourth evolutionary unit presently absent from the study area. Notably, this resulted in a complete replacement of the original lineage in a large part of the distribution of one of the taxa investigated. We discuss the potential evolutionary scenarios leading to this complete mitochondrial replacement and suggest why the previous studies have failed to recover the correct history of this species complex.

AB Global change is not restricted to climate change, and plant species generally face multiple human-driven disturbances constraining their viability. Most importantly, interactions among these drivers frequently generate nonadditive effects that cannot be predicted based on single-factor studies. Our goal was to assess the joint effects of three global change drivers that are especially relevant in Mediterranean ecosystems, namely, fragmentation, reduced habitat quality, and climate change on Centaurea hyssopifolia, a gypsum specialist plant. We carried out a two-year study (2005-2006) in natural populations of this plant in large (>11 ha) and small (<1.5 ha) fragments. Within each fragment, we identified areas of contrasting habitat quality as revealed by plant cover and nutrient content, and within each combination of habitat quality and fragment size we performed a rainfall manipulation experiment simulating the most likely future climate scenario for the region. Survival, growth, phenology, and reproductive success of selected plants were monitored. The three drivers profoundly affected responses of Centaurea hyssopifolia in both study years, phenology being mainly affected by changes in habitat quality and reductions in rainfall and reproductive traits being mainly affected by fragmentation. Plants in sites of poor habitat quality and plants in the dry treatment advanced most of their phenophases (flowering and dispersing earlier) and showed reduced growth rate and increased fraction of senescent leaves. Plants growing in small fragments had lower survival, lower number of viable seeds, and a reduced seed set compared to those from large fragments. We found significant synergistic interactions among drivers. For example, the interaction between fragmentation and habitat quality led to lower survival and lower relative growth in plants from small and poor-quality habitat sites. Our results highlight the importance of studies addressing simultaneously all relevant drivers of global change potentially affecting plant performance under natural conditions. In addition, the complex responses of phenology and reproductive traits of C. hyssopifolia emphasize the need for studies integrating traits from vegetative to reproductive and from the organ to the whole-plant level.

AB Increased N deposition in Europe has affected mire ecosystems. However, knowledge on the physiological responses is poor. We measured photosynthetic responses to increasing N deposition in two peatmoss species (Sphagnum balticum and Sphagnum fuscum) from a 3-year, north-south transplant experiment in northern Europe, covering a latitudinal N deposition gradient ranging from 0.28 g N m(-2) year(-1) in the north, to 1.49 g N m(-2) year(-1) in the south. The maximum photosynthetic rate (NPmax) increased southwards, and was mainly explained by tissue N concentration, secondly by allocation of N to the photosynthesis, and to a lesser degree by modified photosystem II activity (variable fluorescence/maximum fluorescence yield). Although climatic factors may have contributed, these results were most likely attributable to an increase in N deposition southwards. For S. fuscum, photosynthetic rate continued to increase up to a deposition level of 1.49 g N m(-2) year(-1), but for S. balticum it seemed to level out at 1.14 g N m(-2) year(-1). The results for S. balticum suggested that transplants from different origin (with low or intermediate N deposition) respond differently to high N deposition. This indicates that Sphagnum species may be able to adapt or physiologically adjust to high N deposition. Our results also suggest that S. balticum might be more sensitive to N deposition than S. fuscum. Surprisingly, NPmax was not (S. balticum), or only weakly (S. fuscum) correlated with biomass production, indicating that production is to a great extent is governed by factors other than the photosynthetic capacity.

AB Riverine floodplains are pulsing ecosystems that expand and contract with changing flow. In this study we quantified large-scale expansion and contraction dynamics of surface waters along a 41.5 km braided section of the last remaining semi-natural large Alpine gravel-bed river (Tagliamento River; NE Italy). To assess surface-subsurface exchange patterns We measured discharge and vertical hydraulic gradients at multiple locations along the corridor. We identified two river sections delineated by distinct geomorphic knickpoints. In the upper 29 km, Section I (losing zone), surface flow decreased on average by 2.5 +/- 0.8 m(3) s(-1) per river-km. In the downstream 12.5 km, Section II (gaining zone), surface How increased on average by 0.3 +/- 0.1 m(3)s(-1) per river-km. The losing zone experienced frequent and extensive drying and rewetting cycles. The length of the dry river section was measured over a 1.5 year period using differential GPS. Up to 23 km of Section I fell dry at the surface. Frequent and irregular flow pulses led to rapid expansions of the wetted channel at velocities of up to 3 km h(-1), while the subsequent contraction velocities were less than 0-5 km h(-1). Water level was linearly regressed against the total length of the dry river section (r(2) = 0.74; p < 0.0001). This relationship, in combination with a continuous stage record, was used to evaluate expansion and contraction dynamics over a 4 year period. Timing, frequency, magnitude (spatial extent) and duration of expansion and contraction dynamics reflected the flashy flow regime of the Tagliamento River, including a high intra- and inter-annual variability of surface drying and rewetting. Our study emphasizes that even small changes in How can cause major increases or decreases of ecosystem size, thereby creating a highly dynamic and harsh environment for both terrestrial and aquatic organisms.

AB Evaluating the ecological and economic benefits of nature reserves in a fair way is a difficult problem confronting not only conservation scientists and managers but also governments and private land owners. Nature reserves and other social and economic land uses must be evaluated on an objective basis to provide an accurate measure of relative benefits for decision-making. The ecological and economic benefits of various land uses can be expressed in equivalent terms using emergy as a common denominator. Emergy synthesis is a biophysical, donor-based method of valuation that we used to assess the ecological-economic system of the Yancheng Biosphere Reserve (YBR) in North Jiangsu Province, China. In this paper, we introduce new emergy measures designed especially to capture the conservation value of natural lands, as well as a measure of the economic viability of nature reserves. The network structure of natural resources, economic production, and conservation activities in Yancheng reserve was examined and compared to the Maipo Nature Reserve (MNR) in Hong Kong, and a salt marsh ecological-engineering system also in Yancheng. This study showed that there is about a 10:1 return on the emergy invested by government in operating the Yancheng Biosphere Reserve, which is a major migratory stop-over and wintering site for the endangered red-crowned crane (Grus japonensis). Only 2.2% of the support for conservation in YBR comes from the private sector compared to 41.4% for MNR. One way to improve social self-sufficiency of the reserve is to develop ecotourism and private donors, which will increase economic vitality and mitigate the intense economic competition for reserve land.

AB A screening approach for the EU-scale is introduced and validated that predicts pesticide runoff and related ecological risk for aquatic communities in small agricultural streams. The approach is based on the runoff potential (RP) of stream sites, by a spatially explicit calculation based on pesticide use, precipitation, topography, land use and soil characteristics in the near-stream environment. The underlying simplified model complies with the limited availability and resolution of data at larger scales. RP is transformed to ecological risk by means of a runoff-response relationship between RP and invertebrate community composition that results from a large-scale investigation and considers the influence of landscape-mediated recovery pools. Community composition is expressed as abundance of SPEcies At Risk (SPEAR) i.e. species that are potentially affected by pesticides because of physiological sensitivity to organic pollutants and ecological traits. The SPEAR concept was applied because it provides powerful community descriptors that are independent of habitat parameters and support comparison of pesticide effects between different geographical regions. Raster maps for the EU before the 2004 enlargement indicate that ecological risk from pesticide runoff is potentially low for streams in 34% of the grid cells with non-irrigated arable land (mostly northern countries, predicted effects at <= 20% of the streams per cell). In contrast, ecological risk is very high in 19% of the grid cells (central and southern countries, predicted effects at >90% of the streams per cell). Field investigations showed that the screening approach produced appropriate estimates of ecological risk from pesticide runoff for selected regions in Finland, France and Germany.

AB The genetic and evolutionary relationship among 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol (PhI)-producing pseudomonads that protect plants from soil-borne pathogens were investigated by multilocus sequence typing. A total of 65 pseudomonads consisting of 58 Phi-positive biocontrol strains of worldwide origin and seven Phi-negative representatives of characterized Pseudomonas species were compared using 10 housekeeping genes (i.e. rrs, dsbA, gyrB, rpoD, fdxA, recA, rpoB, fusA, rpsL and rpsG). Multilocus sequence typing differentiated 51 strains among 58 PhI-positive pseudomonads and proved to be as discriminative as enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus polymerase chain reaction profiling. As phylogenetic trees inferred from each locus were rather incongruent with one another, we derived the topology from all concatenated loci, which led to the identification of six main groups of Phi-producing Pseudomonas spp. Taxonomically, these groups could correspond to at least six different species. Linkage disequilibrium analysis pointed to a rather clonal structure, even when the analysis was restricted to Phi-producing pseudomonads from a same geographic location or a same phylogenetic group. Intragenic recombination was evidenced for gyrB, rpoD and fdxA, but was shown to be a weaker force than mutation in the origin of intragenetic diversity. This is the first multilocus assessment of the phylogeny and population structure of an ecologically important bacterial group involved in plant disease suppression.

ID CONSERVATION PRIORITIES; RED LIST
AB Allocating money for species conservation on the basis of threatened species listings is not the most cost-effective way of promoting recovery or minimizing extinction rates. Using ecological and social factors in addition to threat categories, we designed a decision-support process to assistpolicy makers in their allocation of resources for the management of native wildlife and to clarify the considerations leading to a priority listing. Each species is scored on three criteria at the scale of the relevant jurisdiction: (1) threat category, (2) consequences of extinction, and (3) potential for successful recovery. This approach provides opportunity for independent input by policy makers and other stakeholders (who weight the relative importance of the criteria) and scientists (who score the species against the criteria). Thus the process explicitly separates societal values from the technical aspects of the decision-making process while acknowledging the legitimacy of both inputs. We applied our technique to two Australian case studies at different spatial scales: the frogs of Queensland (1,728,000 km(2); 116 species) and the mammals of the Wet Tropics bioregion (18,500 km(2); 96 species). We identified 7 frog and 10 mammal species as priorities for conservation, The frogs included I of the 9 species classified as endangered under Queensland legislation, 3 of the 10 species classified as vulnerable, 2 of the 22 species classified as rare, and I of the 75 species classified as least concern. The mammals identified included 3 of the 6 species classified as endangered, I of the 4 species classified as vulnerable, 5 of the 11 species classified as rare, and I of the 75 species classified as least concern. The methods we used to identify species were robust to comparisons across the two taxonomic groups. We concluded that (1) our process facilitates comparisons of data required to make transparent, cost-effective, and strategic management decisions across taxonomic groups and (2) the process should be used to short-list species for further discussion rather than for allocating resources per se.

AB 1. Small permanent streams are coming under increasing pressure for water abstraction. Although these abstractions might only be required on a short-term basis (e.g. summer time irrigation), the highest demand for water often coincides with seasonal low flows.
   2. We constructed weirs and diversions that reduced discharge in three small streams (< 4 m width) to test the hypotheses that short-term water abstractions would decrease habitat availability and suitability for invertebrates, resulting in increased invertebrate drift, reduced taxonomic richness and decreased benthic invertebrate densities.
   3. We sampled benthic invertebrates, invertebrate drift and periphyton at control (upstream) and impact (downstream) sites on each stream before and during 1 month of discharge reduction.
   4. Discharge decreased by an average of 89-98% at impact sites and wetted width decreased by 24-30%. Water depth decreased by 28-64% while velocity decreased by 50-62%. Water conductivity, temperature and dissolved oxygen showed varying responses to flow reduction among the three streams, whereas algal biomass and pH were unaffected in all streams.
   5. The densities of invertebrate taxa tended to increase in the impact reaches of these streams, even though invertebrate drift increased at impact sites in the first few days following discharge reduction. There were a higher proportion of mayflies, stoneflies and caddisflies at the impact site on one stream after flow reduction. There were no changes to the number of taxa or species evenness at impact sites.
   6. Our results suggest that for these small streams, the response of invertebrates to short-term discharge reduction was to accumulate in the decreased available area, increasing local invertebrate density.

AB 1. Global change may strongly affect population dynamics, but mechanisms remain elusive. Several Arctic goose species have increased considerably during the last decades. Climate, and land-use changes outside the breeding area have been invoked as causes but have not been tested. We analysed the relationships between conditions on wintering and migration staging areas, and survival in Svalbard pink-footed geese Anser brachyrhynchus. Using mark-recapture data from 14 winters (1989-2002) we estimated survival rates and tested for time trends, and effects of climate, goose density and land-use.
   2. Resighting rates differed for males and females, were higher for birds recorded during the previous winter and changed smoothly over time. Survival rates did not differ between sexes, varied over time with a nonsignificant negative trend, and were higher for the first interval after marking (0.88-0.97) than afterwards (0.74-0.93). Average survival estimates were 0.967 (SE 0.026) for the first and 0.861 (SE 0.023) for all later survival intervals.
   3. We combined 16 winter and spring climate covariates into two principal components axes. F1 was related to warm/wet winters and an early spring on the Norwegian staging areas and F2 to dry/cold winters. We expected that F1 would be positively related to survival and F2 negatively. F1 explained 23% of survival variation (F-1,F-10 = 3.24; one-sided P = 0.051) when alone in a model and 28% (F-1,F-9 = 4.50; one-sided P = 0.031) in a model that assumed a trend for survival. In contrast, neither F2 nor density, land-use, or scaring practices on important Norwegian spring staging areas had discernible effects on survival.
   4. Climate change may thus affect goose population dynamics, with warmer winters and earlier springs enhancing survival and fecundity. A possible mechanism is increased food availability on Danish wintering and Norwegian staging areas. As geese are among the main herbivores in Arctic ecosystems, climate change, by increasing goose populations, may have important indirect effects on Arctic vegetation. Our study also highlights the importance of events outside the breeding area for the population dynamics of migrant species.

AB Molecular tools are a standard part of many conservation studies and can be informative at many different levels of analysis, although there are inherent limitations and strengths of different genes or parts of genes to inform-specific questions. Animal DNA barcodes, 600- to 800-base-pair segments of the mitochondrial gene cytochrome oxidase I, have been proposed as a means to quantify global biodiversity. Although mitochondrial (mt) DNA has a long history of use at the species level, recent analyses suggest that the use of a single gene, particularly mitochondrial, is unlikely to yield data that are balanced, universally acceptable, or sufficient in taxonomic scope to recognize many species lineages. Mitochondrial and nuclear genomes have different patterns of evolution and modes of inheritance, which can result in very different assessments of biodiversity. The ramifications of choosing a particular definition of species (species concept) need to be carefully considered because current efforts have designated DNA barcodes as the universal species concept without demonstrating its superiority over preexisting concepts. The results of such a barcoding paradigm may include a failure to recognize significant portions of biodiversity or nuclear/mitochondrial mixed lineages and could spuriously focus conservation resources on populations with relatively minor mtDNA divergence. DNA barcodes are most likely to provide potentially useful information for groups that are already well studied, and such taxa do not constitute the majority of biodiversity or those in most need of research attention. DNA barcode-length sequences are an important source of data but, when used alone or out of context, may offer only a fraction of the information needed to characterize species while taking resources from broader studies that could produce information essential to robust and informed conservation decisions.

AB Freshwater biodiversity is under threat worldwide, but the intensity of threat in the Oriental biogeographic region of tropical Asia is exceptional. Asia is the most densely populated region on Earth. Many rivers in that region are grossly polluted, and significant portions of their drainage basins and floodplains have been deforested or otherwise degraded. Flow regulation has been practiced for centuries, and thousands of dams have been constructed, with the result that most of the rivers are now dammed, often at several points along their course. Irrigation, hydropower, and flood security are among the perceived benefits. Recent water engineering projects in Asia have been exceptionally aggressive; they include the world's largest and tallest dams in China and a water transfer scheme intended to link India's major rivers. Some of these projects, i.e., those on the Mekong, have international ramifications that have yet to be fully played out. Overexploitation has exacerbated the effects of habitat alterations on riverine biodiversity, particularly that of fishes. Some fishery stocks have collapsed, and many fish and other vertebrate species are threatened with extinction. The pressure from growing impoverished human populations, increasingly concentrated in cities, has forced governments to focus on economic development rather than environmental protection and conservation. Although legislation has been introduced to control water pollution, which is a danger to human health. it is not explicitly intended to protect biodiversity. Where legislation has been enforced, it can be effective against point-source polluters, but it has not significantly reduced the huge quantities of organic pollution from agricultural and domestic sources that contaminate rivers such as the Ganges and Yangtze. River scientists in Asia appear to have had little influence on policy makers or the implementation of water development projects. Human demands from agriculture and industry dominate water allocation policies, and in-stream flow needs for ecosystems have yet to be widely addressed. Restoration of Asian rivers to their original state is impractical given the constraints prevailing in the region, but some degree of rehabilitation will be possible if relevant legislation and scientific information are promptly applied. Opportunities do exist: enforcement of environmental legislation in China has been strengthened, leading to the suspension of major dam projects. The 2003 introduction of an annual fishing moratorium along the Yangtze River, as well as breeding and restocking programs for endangered fishes in the Yangtze and Mekong, offer the chance to leverage other initiatives that enhance river health and preserve biodiversity, particularly that of fish species. Preliminary data indicate that degraded rivers still retain some biodiversity that can be the focus of rehabilitation efforts. To strengthen these efforts, it is important to identify which ecological features enhance biodiversity and which ones make rivers more vulnerable to human impacts.

AB Above-ground herbivory is ubiquitous in terrestrial ecosystems, yet its impacts on below-ground processes and consequences for plants remain ambiguous. To examine whether physiological responses of individual trees may potentially modify soil nutrient availability, we subjected Fagus sylvatica L. (European beech) and Abies alba Mill. (silver fir) to simulated foliar herbivory over two growing seasons. Above-ground herbivory enhanced N mineralization and inorganic N availability in the soil. The total input of C from the plant roots to the soil is not known; however, carbon sequestration in the soil, measured using stable isotopic techniques, was unaffected by herbivory. Fagus responded to herbivory by producing larger leaves, with increased photosynthetic capacity and N content, which largely compensated for the loss of biomass; Abies exhibited no such response. We conclude that despite large interspecific differences in the growth response, tree physiological responses to foliar herbivory are capable of directly modifying soil biological processes.

AB Crops with economically valuable reproductive structures show the greatest negative discrepancy between average and record yields. To alleviate environmental stress-related yield reductions, a better understanding of the relative sensitivities of pollen development, dehiscence, pollen germination, pollen tube growth, fertilization, and subsequent boll development is needed. Progress in identifying the sensitivities of these developmental stress responses has been hampered in part by the lack of a rapid and reliable method of germinating cotton (Gossypium spp.) pollen in vitro. The present study describes the development of an in vitro cotton pollen germination system that provides improved pollen germination levels and pollen tube growth over existing methods. This procedure was used to evaluate the temperature sensitivity of pollen from greenhouse and field-grown cotton. The medium comprises 10% (wtv) agarose (pH 7.6), 25% (wtv) sucrose, 0.52 mM KNO3,3.06 mM MnSO4,1.66 mM H3BO3,0.42 mM MgSO(4)(,)7H(2)O, and 1.0 muM A(3) gibberellic acid. The medium is overlayed with a layer of 1.5% agarose before use. Optimum pollen germination and rapid tube elongation occurred between 28 and WC under 80% relative humidity. Decreased pollen germination occurred at temperatures above 37degreesC, and decreased tube elongation occurred at temperatures above 32degreesC. Evaluation of pollen, taken at 1400 h from field-grown cotton plants, showed that pollen from flowers exposed to direct sunlight had reduced viability compared with pollen from flowers inside the canopy. This could be attributed to the fact that flowers from field-grown irrigated cotton plants exposed to full sunlight experienced internal temperatures as high as 39degreesC, well above the 28 to 31degreesC optimum for pollen germination.

AB Insect herbivore densities can respond to changes in host plant vigor. While. many basic studies have described the generalized patterns and-mechanisms of host plant influence on herbivore densities and biological traits, fewer studies have shown practical applications for the observed ecological patterns. We assessed the effect of different irrigation amounts on grapevine (Vitis, vinifera L., cv. Thompson Seedless) condition and the resulting changes to an insect herbivore (the variegated leafhopper, Erythroneura variabilis Beamer). Water amounts delivered to vines were manipulated with respect to amounts delivered in a weighing lysimeter: 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0, 1.2, and 1.4 times that used by vines in the lysimeter. We then followed plant growth measurements and leafhopper density and biological. traits throughout the growing season. By August and September,, midday leaf water potential, mean shoot length, vegetative growth, and pruning mass were a positive linear function of applied water amounts. The amount of N per unit leaf area decreased as applied water amounts increased. Similar to measured levels of vine growth, there was a seasonal response of leafhopper density to applied water amounts. By August and September, leafhopper density was a positive linear function of applied water amounts. Dry Mass of fifth instar leafhoppers, the numbers of marked and recaptured adults, and leafhopper egg deposition were also, positively correlated to irrigation amounts. Our results indicate that the greatest influence of manipulated vine growth and irrigation amounts may be due to differences in adult leafhopper movement and reproductive potential, which has implications for dispersal of pests between vineyards. We demonstrated that applied irrigation amounts to vines can be manipulated to suppress insect herbivore density without negatively influencing crop yield. We discuss our results of insect herbivore response to changes in plant water stress within the context of the plant vigor hypothesis.

AB 1. From the early 1960s to 2000 Nezara viridula (Heteroptera: Pentatomidae) expanded its range northwards in Japan and reached Osaka following climate warming recorded in the region.
   2. The timing of diapause induction and its effect on life-history traits were studied under quasi-natural conditions in Osaka. Egg masses were placed outdoors in six series in July-November 1999. Developmental events were monitored until September 2000.
   3. Adult diapause was induced in September-October in agreement with the photoperiodic response obtained under laboratory conditions. Induction of diapause in early October ensured the highest winter survival. Nymphs that hatched after late September died by December-April showing that the species cannot survive winter in the nymphal stage.
   4. Life-history traits varied between the early (non-diapause reproduction) and late (post-diapause reproduction) series. Thus, non-diapause females produced significantly fewer egg masses than did females that reproduced only after diapause. The timing of diapause induction strongly affected overwintering success and post-diapause performance: females that became adults and entered diapause in October lived longer, had a longer period of oviposition, and produced more eggs in larger egg masses than females that attained adulthood and entered diapause in September.
   5. Females from the early series reproduced until late November, although progeny from the late September eggs were destined to die during the winter. Pre-winter reproduction of adults that emerged in mid-September or later was a result of the imperfect timing of diapause induction. It is an ineffective allocation of resources and may be considered the ecological cost of range expansion.
   6. To establish in the region, N. viridula will probably evolve a lengthening of the critical photoperiod of the diapause induction response. This will allow the species to enter diapause earlier and, thus, avoid maladaptive late-autumn reproduction but, perhaps, increase the cost of diapause because of a possible adverse impact of pre-winter high temperature conditions on overwintering.

AB This is the first study using flow cytometry to characterize the population dynamics of freshwater autotrophic picoplankton (APP) over a full seasonal cycle, the goal of which was to accurately quantify and qualify the natural APP populations in relation to major environmental parameters. In particular, we wanted to test current assumptions about the seasonal succession of prokaryotic and eukaryotic picoplankton cells, including the relationship between solitary picocyanobacteria and microcolonies. Using flow cytometry, we were able to efficiently characterize the abundances of 4 lake APP assemblages in Lake Mondsee, including that of a solitary picocyanobacterial population exhibiting high "side scatter" values. Such cells were not readily enumerated by epi-fluorescence microscopy. Unlike Lakes Constance and Maggiore, we found no evidence of a spring peak in solitary picocyanobacteria - we propose that the lack of a spring peak in Lake Mondsee was due to weak stratification in March-April and relatively deep vertical mixing. Since summer declines in the abundance of solitary picocyanobacteria were associated with extended periods of reduced light availability, it is likely that such declines were in part due to low relative growth rates, Finally, we argue that the formation of microcolonies by picocyanobacteria is unlikely to be a strategy for more efficient nutrient recycling (e.g. Stockner & Antia 1986). Rather, we suggest that microcolonies reach high concentrations in surface and near-surface waters due to the production of a photosynthate-rich mucilage resulting from active photosynthesis during periods of severe nutrient deficiency.

AB 1. Improved nutrition may cause an increase in body size in animals, while increased ambient temperature may result in a decrease in body size, as expected from Bergmann's rule. In Israel, during the last 50 years both food availability for animals commensal with humans and ambient temperature have increased.
   2. Using museum data, temporal changes in body size of five species of carnivorous mammals commensal with humans were examined.
   3. An increase in body length was found in four species, and appears to be related to improved nutrition owing to a substantial increase in the amount of garbage and agricultural crops available to commensal mammals that has occurred since the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948.
   4.The larger species were more affected than the smaller ones, apparently because of their higher position in the feeding hierarchy or because of having larger home ranges.
   5. The increases are convergent with the increase in human body height observed during the past two centuries.
   6. These changes illustrate the fast rate of animal response to changing environmental conditions.

AB Potted Cabernet Sauvignon and Chardonnay grapevines were grown in southeastern Australia under either ambient or reduced ultraviolet (UV) radiation to test the effect of UV on powdery mildew (Uncinula necator) susceptibility. Diacetate films were used to screen out UV-B (280-315 nm) and UV-A (315-400 nm). Two nitrogen treatments (0 or 3 g N per plant) were applied at bloom to test interactions of nitrogen status with UV radiation. Cabernet Sauvignon was much less susceptible to U. necator and also responded less to UV and nitrogen. U. necator incidence and severity on leaves were increased dramatically when high nitrogen supply was combined with low UV, particularly in Chardonnay. The differences in infection were not due to variation in canopy microclimate (temperature and humidity) caused by experimental treatments. However, high disease susceptibility in response to high nitrogen status and low UV radiation was related to low concentrations of constitutive phenolic compounds (flavonol glycosides and, to a lesser extent, hydroxy-cinnamic acid derivatives), high leaf-nitrogen status and photosynthetic rates, high succulence, and reduced cuticular wax deposition. No stilbene phytoalexins could be detected following infection, suggesting that stilbenes are not involved in U. necator resistance in grapevines. These results show that UV radiation affects disease susceptibility of grapevine cultivars and that this susceptibility is modulated by nitrogen supply.

AB The family Vespertilionidae comprises the largest number of species in the order Chiroptera, and its members are distributed over most of the world. We collected sequences of the mitochondrial NDI (NADH dehydrogenase subunit 1) gene from 38 species as well as 20 sequences of exon28 of the vWF (von Willebrand Factor) gene and analyzed phylogenetic relationships in Vespertilionidae using maximum-likelihood analyses and SINE (short interspersed elements) insertions. Our data strongly suggest the following: (1) Murininae and Myotis, each of which is classified into different subfamilies, are monophyletic; (2) the monophyly of Murininae, Myotis, Pipistrellini, and Plecotini is supported by our analyses of the NDI and nuclear vWF as well as data from SINE insertions, while Miniopterinae was not included in this group; and (3) Rhinolophoidea (microchiroptera) is separated from all the other microchiropteran species. Our study represents the most comprehensive phylogenetic model of Vespertilionidae to date.

AB Aim Animal assemblages in fragmented landscapes are likely to be determined by contemporary (e.g. patch size, biotic interactions) and historical (e.g. change in patch area) characteristics of patches and their positioning in the landscape (e.g. connectivity). We considered the influence of habitat structure, landscape context, history and an aggressive, native bird species [the Noisy Miner Manorina melanocephala (Latham 1801)] on three characteristics of woodland-dependent bird assemblages in a fragmented, eucalypt-forest landscape. The response variables were: (1) species richness (SR), (2) sums-of-densities (i.e. total number of individual birds), and (3) occurrence of rare species [through a rare-species index (RSI)].
   Location Box-ironbark, eucalypt forests of central Victoria, Australia (broadly bounded by: 36-37degrees S, 142-146degrees E).
   Methods There were replicates of four size-classes of fragments (10, 20, 40, 80 ha) and replicates of the same size-classes set within large blocks of extant forest. This design allowed us to distinguish between area-specific and fragmentation effects by comparing same-sized fragments and reference areas to establish fragmentation-specific impacts.
   Results Species richness was less than expected in smaller fragments and this was apparently because of current fragment area, density of the Noisy Miner and habitat quality. The RSI exhibited similar dependencies, while sums-of-densities appeared to be related to the number and quality of wooded linkages to fragments. The historical variable was forested-area change of each fragment between 1963 and 1996, and was found to have no relationship to any of the response variables.
   Main conclusions The lack of historical influence suggested that the avifaunas of the fragments are unlikely to be `relaxing' from isolation effects through local extinctions, but are more likely to be dominated by dynamic recolonization and abandonment both seasonally and among years. The dependence of sums-of-densities on the linkage variable appeared to be largely because of the responses of two species, the Red Wattlebird Anthochaera curunculata (Shaw, 1790) and the Yellow-tufted Honeyeater Lichenostomus melanops (Latham, 1801). These species are among the three most common in the large forest blocks, but are much rarer in fragments. The connectedness effect suggests that these species may depend upon linkages to occupy fragments that are only moderately distant from large forested areas within this region.

AB Adults of many closely related coral reef fish species are segregated along gradients of depth or! habitat structure. Both habitat selection by new settlers and subsequent competitive interactions can potentially produce such patterns, but their relative importance is unclear. This study examines the potential roles of habitat selection and aggression in determining the spatial distribution of adults and juveniles of four highly aggressive damselfishes at Lizard Island, northern Great Barrier Reef. Dischistodus perspicillatus, D. prosopotaenia, D. melanotus, and D. pseudochrysopoecilus maintain almost non-overlapping distributions across reef zones, with adults of one species dominating each reef zone. Juveniles exhibit slightly broader distributional patterns suggesting that subsequent interactions reduce overlap among species. Although habitat choice experiments in aquaria suggest, that associations between juveniles and substrata types in the field are partly due to habitat selection, large overlaps in the use of substrata by the different species were also found, suggesting that substratum selection alone is insufficient in explaining the discrete spatial distributions of adults. The strength of aggressive interactions among all four species was tested by a "bottle" experiment, in which an adult or juvenile of each species was placed in the territories of adult fish on the reef. The greatest levels of interspecific aggression were directed against adults and juveniles of neighbouring species. The highest levels of aggression were associated with species exhibiting the greatest levels of overlap in resource use. Evidently both habitat selection and interspecific aggression combine to determine the adult distributions of these species.

ID RESTORATION ECOLOGY; FOREST; CONSERVATION
AB Practical steps using landscape ecological concepts to better integrate nature and culture within New Zealand's agricultural landscape are proposed. In New Zealand, nature conservation is typically seen as distinct from agri-business, and the two goals are pursued in different places - with nature having steadily retreated from public view and experience. As a result, the New Zealand agricultural landscape is largely exotic, with little to indicate the rich biogeographical history of the land. In contrast, a productive cultural landscape in which indigenous species (and hence biodiversity) are both present and regenerating is projected. Ecological integrity is defined both in terms of life processes and indigenous content. Several examples are presented of spontaneous regeneration of indigenous species within the context of familiar landscape elements such as hedgerows, roadsides, shelterbelts, woodlots, gardens, and riparian margins. In combination, these elements have the potential to create a new landscape, culturally familiar, non-threatening and productive, yet also achieving biodiversity goals. Creation of such transitional landscapes can reinforce a sense of identity with the unique characteristics of New Zealand-Aotearoa, and in the longer term this will transform the way landscapes are perceived, valued and utilised.

AB In the North American boreal forest, black spruce (Picea mariana) forests have historically regenerated after the passage of large-scale wildfires. Over the past 30 years, tree harvesting has replaced wildfire as the predominant agent of disturbance in black spruce-feathermoss communities in the Lac St. Jean-Chibougamau region of Quebec, Canada. This study addressed how natural and anthropogenic disturbances altered soil and fine root carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) stocks and dynamics under four disturbance types in central Quebec including: (1) recently burned sites, (2) sites recently harvested using a practice called "cutting with protection of tree regeneration and soils" (CPRS), (3) sites that were burned 75-85 yr ago, and (4) sites that were horse-logged 55 yr ago. Soil N contents in the surface organic layer of the recently burned sites (91 g/m(2)) were significantly lower than under the old burn sites (146 g/m(2)). Using equivalent soil masses, total N stores in the mineral soils under the recently harvested stands (76 g/m(2)) were significantly lower than N stores under the old burn sites (114 g/m(2)). In field incubations from June to October 1997, net N mineralization rates in the organic horizons ranged from 3.3 kg/ha (recent burn) to 17.1 kg/ha (old harvest). The largest pools of labile inorganic-P (Bray 2 extractable) were in the organic horizons of the old harvest and old burn sites (59.1 and 55.3 mg/kg, respectively), and these pools increased up to 24% from the beginning to the end of the growing season. Pools of dissolved organic nitrogen in surface organic horizons in all of the disturbance types were highest just after snowmelt and declined steadily through the growing season. The older disturbance types had higher N stores in fine roots compared to the recently disturbed sites, and fine root length in the old harvest sites (1623 m/m(2)) was higher than in the stands burned 75-85 yr ago (917 m/m(2)).

AB The koala, Phascolarctos cinereus, is a geographically widespread species endemic to Australia, with three currently recognized subspecies: P.c. adustus, P.c. cinereus, and P.c. victor. Intraspecific variation in the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region was examined in over 200 animals from 16 representative populations throughout the species' range. Eighteen different haplotypes were defined in the approximate to 860 bp mtDNA control region as determined by heteroduplex analysis/temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (HDA/TGGE). Any single population typically possessed only one or two haplotypes yielding an average within-population haplotypic diversity of 0.180 +/- 0.003, and nucleotide diversity of 0.16%. Overall, mtDNA control region sequence diversity between populations averaged 0.67%, and ranged from 0% to 1.56%. Nucleotide divergence between populations averaged 0.51%, and ranged from 0% to 1.53%. Neighbour-joining methods revealed limited phylogenetic distinction between geographically distant populations of koalas, and tentative support for a single evolutionarily significant unit (ESU). This is consistent with previous suggestions that the morphological differences formalized by subspecific taxonomy may be interpreted as clinal variation. Significant differentiation in mtDNA-haplotype frequencies between localities suggested that little gene now currently exists among populations. When combined with microsatellite analysis, which has revealed substantial differentiation among koala populations, we conclude that the appropriate short-term management unit (MU) for koalas is the local population.

AB Plants grown at elevated CO2 often acclimate such that their photosynthetic capacities are reduced relative to ambient CO2-grown plants. Reductions in synthesis of photosynthetic enzymes could result either from reduced photosynthetic gene expression or from reduced availability of nitrogen-containing substrates for enzyme synthesis. Increased carbohydrate concentrations resulting from increased photosynthetic carbon fixation at elevated CO2 concentrations have been suggested to reduce the expression of photosynthetic genes. However, recent studies have also suggested that nitrogen uptake may be depressed by elevated CO2, or at least that it is not increased enough to keep pace with increased carbohydrate production. This response could induce a nitrogen limitation in elevated-CO2 plants that might account for the reduction in photosynthetic enzyme synthesis. If CO2 acclimation were a response to limited nitrogen uptake, the effects of elevated CO2 and limiting nitrogen supply on photosynthesis and nitrogen allocation should be similar. To test this hypothesis we grew non-nodulating soybeans at two levels each of nitrogen and CO2 concentration and measured leaf nitrogen contents, photosynthetic capacities and Rubisco contents. Both low nitrogen and elevated CO2 reduced nitrogen as a percentage of total leaf dry mass but only low nitrogen supply produced significant decreases in nitrogen as a percentage of leaf structural dry mass. The primary effect of elevated CO2 was to increase non-structural carbohydrate storage rather than to decrease nitrogen content. Both low nitrogen supply and elevated CO2 also decreased carboxylation capacity (V-cmax) and Rubisco content per unit leaf area. However, when V-cmax and Rubisco content were expressed per unit nitrogen, low nitrogen supply generally caused them to increase whereas elevated CO2 generally caused them to decrease. Finally, elevated CO2 significantly increased the ratio of RuBP regeneration capacity to V-cmax whereas neither nitrogen supply nor plant age had a significant effect on this parameter. We conclude that reductions in photosynthetic enzyme synthesis in elevated CO2 appear not to result from limited nitrogen supply but instead may result from feedback inhibition by increased carbohydrate contents.

AB Catastrophic uprooting of forest canopy trees creates mounds, pits, and other microsites that provide opportunities for regeneration of particular species. We measured environmental factors on five types of microsites created by simulated blowdown of a mixed deciduous forest in central New England, United States. We then estimated spatial variation in resource levels and quantified congruence among different resources at each site. Effects of simulated blowdown on light levels and CO2 concentrations were more pronounced after three years than effects on nitrogen availability and other soil resources. Spatial heterogeneity in light levels and net nitrification rates was greater in the blowdown, but heterogeneities of soil organic matter concentration and net mineralization rates were greater in the undisturbed forest. Availability of nitrate, a limiting resource in most New England forests, was low on mounds and in pits, but high on the vertical portion of forest floor resulting from uprooting of canopy trees. At a spatial scale relevant to seedlings, resource congruence was greater in the undisturbed forest than in the experimental blowdown, primarily because of the effects of blowdown on light levels. Congruence in the blowdown increased with an increase in spatial scale, but congruence in the undisturbed forest was similar at both spatial scales. Seedling growth of two birch species was correlated with light levels and with congruence among soil resources. This study shows that immediate disturbance effects on microtopography and light levels determine recruitment patterns of colonizing species, with changes in soil resource levels influencing later community development. Furthermore, some species appear to respond to resource congruence, which may provide an additional dimension to the regeneration niche.

AB Two cultivars of sorghum (CK60 and Ochuti) and one cultivar of maize (H511) were grown in field plots in western Kenya in the presence or absence of the parasitic angiosperm Striga hermonthica, with or without a single addition of nitrogen fertilizer (150 kg N ha(-1)) using a factorial design, A progressive decline in rates of photosynthesis of Striga-infected plants were observed for the sorghum cultivar CK60 from 30 d after planting (DAP) and for maize from 40 DAP, until measurements ended 63 DAP. At this time photosynthetic rates were 46% and 31% lower in the Striga-infected sorghum and maize cultivars, respectively, compared to uninfected control plants. No decline in photosynthesis was observed in the second sorghum cultivar studied, Ochuti, a local land race reported to show some tolerance to the parasite. The trends in photosynthesis reflected stunting of the cereals, as determined by the height of the youngest emerged ligule, however, only the grain yield of the sorghum cultivar CK60 was significantly reduced by the presence of the parasite. The nitrogen application influenced neither the growth nor the photosynthetic parameters measured, and possible explanations for the absence of responses are discussed. It is concluded that S. hermonthica can reduce photosynthetic rates of field-grown sorghum and maize, and suggest that an ability to maintain high rates of photosynthesis whilst infected may be an important correlate of tolerance to the parasite.

AB We compared inbreeding depression in hermaphroditic Schiedea lydgatei and its gynodioecious sister species, S. salicaria, to infer the level of inbreeding depression in their common ancestor. With measurements of selfing rates, this information can be used to assess the importance of inbreeding depression in the evolution of breeding systems in S. lydgatei and S. salicaria. Morphological and physiological characters related to fitness were compared for inbred and outcrossed S. lydgatei in high- and low-fertilizer environments in the greenhouse. Seed mass, number of seeds per capsule, germination, survival, biomass, number of flowers, and age at first flowering were compared for inbred versus outcrossed progeny. We also measured inbreeding depression in maximal rates of photosynthetic carbon assimilation and stomatal conductance to water vapor, traits that affect fitness through their influence on plant carbon balance and water-use efficiency (ratio of carbon gain to water loss). All traits except number of seeds per capsule in parents and survival showed inbreeding depression, with the magnitude depending on family and environment. High inbreeding depression is likely in the ancestor of S. lydgatei and S. salicaria, indicating that, with sufficiently high selfing rates, females could spread in populations. Hermaphroditism in S. lydgatei is probably favored by low selfing rates. In contrast, the evolution of gynodioecy in S. salicaria apparently has been favored by relatively high selfing rates in combination with high inbreeding depression.

AB Hyperspectral acquisitions have proven to be the most informative Earth observation data source for the estimation of nitrogen (N) content, which is the main limiting nutrient for plant growth and thus agricultural production. In the past, empirical algorithms have been widely employed to retrieve information on this biochemical plant component from canopy reflectance. However, these approaches do not seek for a cause-effect relationship based on physical laws. Moreover, most studies solely relied on the correlation of chlorophyll content with nitrogen, and thus neglected the fact that most N is bound in proteins. Our study presents a hybrid retrieval method using a physically-based approach combined with machine learning regression to estimate crop N content. Within the workflow, the leaf optical properties model PROSPECT-PRO including the newly calibrated specific absorption coefficients (SAC) of proteins, was coupled with the canopy reflectance model 4SAIL to PROSAIL-PRO. The latter was then employed to generate a training database to be used for advanced probabilistic machine learning methods: a standard homoscedastic Gaussian process (GP) and a heteroscedastic GP regression that accounts for signal-to-noise relations. Both GP models have the property of providing confidence intervals for the estimates, which sets them apart from other machine learners. Moreover, a GP-based sequential backward band removal algorithm was employed to analyze the band-specific information content of PROSAIL-PRO simulated spectra for the estimation of aboveground N. Data from multiple hyperspectral field campaigns, carried out in the framework of the future satellite mission Environmental Mapping and Analysis Program (EnMAP), were exploited for validation. In these campaigns, corn and winter wheat spectra were acquired to simulate spectral EnMAP data. Moreover, destructive N measurements from leaves, stalks and fruits were collected separately to enable plant-organ-specific validation. The results showed that both GP models can provide accurate aboveground N simulations, with slightly better results of the heteroscedastic GP in terms of model testing and against in situ N measurements from leaves plus stalks, with root mean square error (RMSE) of 2.1 g/m(2). However, the inclusion of fruit N content for validation deteriorated the results, which can be explained by the inability of the radiation to penetrate the thick tissues of stalks, corn cobs and wheat ears. GP-based band analysis identified optimal spectral settings with ten bands mainly situated in the shortwave infrared (SWIR) spectral region. Use of well-known protein absorption bands from the literature showed comparative results. Finally, the heteroscedastic GP model was successfully applied on airborne hyperspectral data for N mapping. We conclude that GP algorithms, and in particular the heteroscedastic GP, should be implemented for global agricultural monitoring of aboveground N from future imaging spectroscopy data.

AB The terrestrial biosphere plays a critical role in mitigating climate change by absorbing anthropogenic CO2 emissions through photosynthesis. The rate of photosynthesis is determined jointly by environmental variables and the intrinsic photosynthetic capacity of plants (i.e. maximum carboxylation rate; Vc(max)(25)). A lack of an effective means to derive spatially and temporally explicit Vc(max)(25) has long hampered efforts towards estimating global photosynthesis accurately. Recent work suggests that leaf chlorophyll content (Chl(leaf)) is strongly related to Vc(max)(25), since Chl(leaf) and Vc(max)(25) are both correlated with photosynthetic nitrogen content. We used medium resolution satellite images to derive spatially and temporally explicit Chl(leaf), which we then used to parameterize Vc(max)(25) within a terrestrial biosphere model. Modelled photosynthesis estimates were evaluated against measured photosynthesis at 124 eddy covariance sites. The inclusion of Chl(leaf) in a terrestrial biosphere model improved the spatial and temporal variability of photosynthesis estimates, reducing biases at eddy covariance sites by 8% on average, with the largest improvements occurring for croplands (21% bias reduction) and deciduous forests (15% bias reduction). At the global scale, the inclusion of Chl(leaf) reduced terrestrial photosynthesis estimates by 9 PgC/year and improved the correlations with a reconstructed solar-induced fluorescence product and a gridded photosynthesis product upscaled from tower measurements. We found positive impacts of Chl(leaf) on modelled photosynthesis for deciduous forests, croplands, grasslands, savannas and wetlands, but mixed impacts for shrublands and evergreen broadleaf forests and negative impacts for evergreen needleleaf forests and mixed forests. Our results highlight the potential of Chl(leaf) to reduce the uncertainty of global photosynthesis but identify challenges for incorporating Chlleaf in future terrestrial biosphere models.

AB Conventions and policies for biodiversity conservation and climate change mitigation state the need for increased protection, restoration and climate change adaptation of forests. Much degraded land may be targeted for large-scale forest restoration, yet challenges include costs, a shortage of regeneration material and the need for restored forests to serve as a resource for communities. To ensure ecosystem function for the future, forest restoration programs must: (1) learn from the past; (2) integrate ecological knowledge; (3) advance regeneration techniques and systems; (4) overcome biotic and abiotic disturbances and (5) adapt for future forest landscapes. Historical forest conditions, while site-specific, may help to identify the processes that leave long-term legacies in current forests and to understand tree migration biology/population dynamics and their relationship with climate change. Ecological theory around plant-plant interactions has shown the importance of negative (competition) and positive (facilitation) interactions for restoration, which will become more relevant with increasing drought due to climate change. Selective animal browsing influences plant-plant interactions and challenges restoration efforts to establish species-rich forests; an integrated approach is needed to simultaneously manage ungulate populations, landscape carrying capacity and browse-tolerant regeneration. A deeper understanding of limiting factors that affect plant establishment will facilitate nursery and site preparation systems to overcome inherent restoration challenges. Severe anthropogenic disturbances connected to global change have created unprecedented pressure on forests, necessitating novel ecological engineering, genetic conservation of tree species and landscape-level approaches that focus on creating functional ecosystems in a cost-effective manner.

AB Foliar functional traits refer to a range of biochemical and physiognomic characteristics of vegetation that control photosynthesis, nutrient and water cycling, and can be used to describe the functional diversity of ecosystems. In this study, we utilize NASA AVIRIS - Next Generation imaging spectroscopy data to map 15 foliar functional traits in a grassland experiment at the Cedar Creek Ecosystem Science Reserve, a Long-Term Ecological Research site in Central Minnesota, across three years. To estimate traits, we compared the widely used partial least squares regression (PLSR) with Gaussian processes regression (GPR) to assess differences in model performance and uncertainty estimates. PLSR is attractive for its straightforward implementation and interpretation, but requires bootstrapping-based methods to estimate and map prediction uncertainties. On the other hand, GPR is more complex to implement and interpret, but provides explicit estimates of uncertainties. Our results indicated that foliar functional traits can be retrieved in these grasslands with moderate to high accuracies using either method. Highest validation accuracies were obtained for leaf mass per area (LMA), soluble cell contents, hemicellulose and cellulose (all with R-2 > 0.8), and lower accuracies for lignin, nitrogen, and some pigments with both techniques. The estimations for the mass-based pigments were more accurate than the area-based pigments (at least 5% improvement in normalized RMSE). Overall, GPR and PLSR performed comparably with respect to both skill of predictions and the selection of most informative spectral regions. Maps of uncertainties corresponded well between the two models, with highest uncertainties related to low vegetation cover, high diversity levels, or under irrigation and nitrogen treatments (not represented in the field sampling). The maps showed that trait values in each plot were relatively stable across three years of managed species richness. Our results provide a template for mapping foliar traits and their uncertainties in grasslands, and point to the need for extensive ground data across time to properly evaluate performance of trait mapping algorithms.

AB The recovery and persistence of rare and endangered species are often threatened by genetic factors, such as the accumulation of deleterious mutations, loss of adaptive potential, and inbreeding depression [1]. Island foxes (Urocyon littoralis), the dwarfed descendants of mainland gray foxes (Urocyon cinereoargenteus), have inhabited Califor- nia's Channel Islands for >9,000 years [2-4]. Previous genomic analyses revealed that island foxes have exceptionally low levels of diversity and elevated levels of putatively deleterious variation [5]. Nonetheless, all six populations have persisted for thousands of generations, and several populations rebounded rapidly after recent severe bottlenecks [6, 7]. Here, we combine morphological and genomic data with population-genetic simulations to determine the mechanism underlying the enigmatic persistence of these foxes. First, through analysis of genomes from 1929 to 2009, we show that island foxes have remained at small population sizes with low diversity for many generations. Second, we present morphological data indicating an absence of inbreeding depression in island foxes, confirming that they are not afflicted with congenital defects common to other small and inbred populations. Lastly, our population-genetic simulations suggest that long-term small population size results in a reduced burden of strongly deleterious recessive alleles, providing a mechanism for the absence of inbreeding depression in island foxes. Importantly, the island fox illustrates a scenario in which genetic restoration through human-assisted gene flow could be a counterproductive or even harmful conservation strategy. Our study sheds light on the puzzle of island fox persistence, a unique success story that provides a model for the preservation of small populations.

AB Variation between and within individuals in life history traits is ubiquitous in natural populations. When affecting fitness-related traits such as survival or reproduction, individual heterogeneity plays a key role in population dynamics and life history evolution. However, it is only recently that properly accounting for individual heterogeneity when studying population dynamics of free-ranging populations has been made possible through the development of appropriate statistical models. We aim here to review case studies of individual heterogeneity in the context of capture-recapture models for the estimation of population size and demographic parameters with imperfect detection. First, we define what individual heterogeneity means and clarify the terminology used in the literature. Second, we review the literature and illustrate why individual heterogeneity is used in capture-recapture studies by focusing on the detection of life-history tradeoffs, including senescence. Third, we explain how to model individual heterogeneity in capture-recapture models and provide the code to fit these models . The distinction is made between situations in which heterogeneity is actually measured and situations in which part of the heterogeneity remains unobserved. Regarding the latter, we outline recent developments of random-effect models and finite-mixture models. Finally, we discuss several avenues for future research.

AB A frequent question in invasion ecology is whether the traits of alien plant species differ from natives. This question is increasingly addressed at the plant community scale to assess the role trait differences play in community assembly. Nevertheless, there remains considerable debate as to the value of native vs. alien trait comparisons. Recommendations are made to address seven conceptual and methodological limitations in current approaches used to assess trait differences between native and alien plants: account for spatial scale dependence, make an informed choice of traits, evaluate multiple trait dimensions, incorporate intraspecific trait variation, use appropriate null models, examine environmental gradients, and assess temporal variation in trait spectra. Tackling these limitations will dramatically improve the value of native vs. alien trait comparisons. Traits should be selected based on expectations of abiotic and/or biotic constraints. Phylogenetic distances can provide valuable insights but are no substitute for the measurement of individual traits when contrasting alien and native species. An ideal set of traits would include one or more leaf, stem, seed and root traits as well as flowering phenology and plant height at maturity. Comparisons of intraspecific trait variation among native and alien species within the same plant community are rare but could improve predictions of interspecific competition and the response of communities to plant invasions. The full plant community should be examined rather than selected species subsets and comparisons between native and alien species traits are better undertaken at a neighbourhood scale. The frequency distribution of alien and native species traits may change over time through competitive exclusion as well as contemporary evolution. Repeated surveys of species abundances and traits are required to understand the consequences of trait differences between aliens and natives for plant community assembly. Analyses of the role of species traits in plant invasions need to quantify differences in a priori identified traits within communities along suitable environmental gradients and test hypothetical trait patterns against appropriate null expectations. The infrequent application of such approaches may explain the limited generalisations regarding the role of trait differences between native and alien species in the invasion of plant communities.

AB Occupancy models are increasingly applied to data from wildlife camera-trap (CT) surveys to estimate distribution, habitat use, or relative abundance of unmarked animals. Fundamental to the occupancy modeling framework is the temporal pattern of detections at camera stations, which is influenced by animal population density and the speed and scale of animal movement. How these factors interact with CT sampling designs to affect the interpretation of occupancy parameter estimates is unclear. We developed a simple yet ecologically relevant animal movement simulation to create CT detections for animal populations varying in movement rate, home range area, and population density. We also varied CT sampling design by the duration of sampling and the density of CTs in our simulated domain. A single-species occupancy model was fitted to simulated detection histories, and model-estimated probabilities of occupancy were compared to the asymptotic proportion of area occupied (PAO), calculated as the union of all simulated home ranges. Occupancy model parameter estimates were sensitive to simulated movement and sampling scenarios. Occupancy models overestimated asymptotic PAO when a low population density of simulated animals moved quickly over large home ranges and this positive bias was insensitive to sampling duration. Conversely, asymptotic PAO was underestimated when simulated animals moved slowly in large-or intermediately sized home ranges. This negative bias decreased with increasing sampling duration and a lower density of CTs. Our results emphasize that the interpretation of occupancy models depends on the underlying processes driving CT detections, specifically animal movement and population density, and that model estimates may not reliably reflect variation in these processes. We recommend carefully defining occupancy if it is applied to CT data in order to better match sampling and analytical frameworks to the ecology of sampled wildlife species.

AB This article examines the use of economic analysis to inform bioinvasion management, with particular focus on forest resources. Economics is key for understanding invasion processes, impacts, and decision-making. Biological invasions are driven by and affect economic activities at multiple scales and stages of an invasion. Bioeconomic modeling seeks to inform how resources can be optimally allocated across invasion management activities-including prevention, surveillance programs for early detection and management, and controlling invasion populations and spread-to minimize the long-term costs and damages. Economic analysis facilitates understanding of decisions by public and private decision-makers, gaps between these, and the design of policies to achieve socially desirable outcomes. Private decision-makers may undercontrol invasions relative to socially optimal levels, because they generally account for their own costs and benefits of control but less often for broader ecosystem impacts or future spread across the landscape. Economic analysis considers approaches for increasing private invasion management and evaluates feedbacks between ecological and economic systems that can affect policy outcomes. Future research should continue evaluation and design of control strategies across the biosecurity continuum and across species to enhance cost-effectiveness, better incorporate uncertainty into policy design, increase focus on incentives and behavioral tools to influence private behaviors that affect invasion spread, and incorporate invasive species consideration within broader systems-focused science. In addition, challenges in valuing biodiversity and ecosystem service impacts and the costs and effectiveness of control measures are key data gaps. Greater collaboration between decision-makers and researchers will facilitate development and communication of usable economic research.

AB Many biodiversity-ecosystem services studies omit cultural ecosystem services (CES) or use species richness as a proxy and assume that more species confer greater CES value. We studied wildflower viewing, a key biodiversity-based CES in amenity-based landscapes, in Southern Appalachian Mountain forests and asked (i) How do aesthetic preferences for wildflower communities vary with components of biodiversity, including species richness?; (ii) How do aesthetic preferences for wildflower communities vary across psychographic groups?; and (iii) How well does species richness perform as an indicator of CES value compared with revealed social preferences for wildflower communities? Public forest visitors (n = 293) were surveyed during the summer of 2015 and asked to choose among images of wildflower communities in which flower species richness, flower abundance, species evenness, color diversity, and presence of charismatic species had been digitally manipulated. Aesthetic preferences among images were unrelated to species richness but increased with more abundant flowers, greater species evenness, and greater color diversity. Aesthetic preferences were consistent across psychographic groups and unaffected by knowledge of local flora or value placed on wildflower viewing. When actual wildflower communities (n = 54) were ranked based on empirically measured flower species richness orwildflower viewing utility based on multinomial logit models of revealed preferences, rankings were broadly similar. However, designation of hotspots (CES values above the median) based on species richness alone missed 27% of wildflower viewing utility hotspots. Thus, conservation priorities for sustaining CES should incorporate social preferences and consider multiple dimensions of biodiversity that underpin CES supply.

AB Three-layered feedforward backpropagation (BP) artificial neural networks (ANN) and multiple nonlinear regression (MnLR) models were developed to estimate biogas and methane yield in an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor treating potato starch processing wastewater (PSPW). Anaerobic process parameters were optimized to identify their importance on methanation. pH, total chemical oxygen demand, ammonium, alkalinity, total Kjeldahl nitrogen, total phosphorus, volatile fatty acids and hydraulic retention time selected based on principal component analysis were used as input variables, whiles biogas and methane yield were employed as target variables. Quasi-Newton method and conjugate gradient backpropagation algorithms were best among eleven training algorithms. Coefficient of determination (R-2) of the BP-ANN reached 98.72% and 97.93% whiles MnLR model attained 93.9% and 91.08% for biogas and methane yield, respectively. Compared with the MnLR model, BP-ANN model demonstrated significant performance, suggesting possible control of the anaerobic digestion process with the BP-ANN model. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Horseshoe crabs have persisted for more than 200 million years, and fossil forms date to 450 million years ago. The American horseshoe crab (Limulus polyphemus), one of four extant horseshoe crab species, is found along the Atlantic coastline of North America ranging from Alabama to Maine, USA with another distinct population on the coasts of Campeche, Yucatan and Quintana Roo in the Yucatan Peninsula, M,xico. Although the American horseshoe crab tolerates broad environmental conditions, exploitation and habitat loss threaten the species. We assessed the conservation status of the American horseshoe crab by comprehensively reviewing available scientific information on its range, life history, genetic structure, population trends and analyses, major threats, and conservation. We structured the status assessment by six genetically-informed regions and accounted for sub-regional differences in environmental conditions, threats, and management. The transnational regions are Gulf of Maine (USA), Mid-Atlantic (USA), Southeast (USA), Florida Atlantic (USA), Northeast Gulf of M,xico (USA), and Yucatan Peninsula (M,xico). Our conclusion is that the American horseshoe crab species is vulnerable to local extirpation and that the degree and extent of risk vary among and within the regions. The risk is elevated in the Gulf of Maine region due to limited and fragmented habitat. The populations of horseshoe crabs in the Mid-Atlantic region are stable in the Delaware Bay area, and regulatory controls are in place, but the risk is elevated in the New England area as evidenced by continuing declines understood to be caused by over-harvest. The populations of horseshoe crabs in the Southeast region are stable or increasing. The populations of horseshoe crabs in the Florida Atlantic region show mixed trends among areas, and continuing population reductions at the embayment level have poorly understood causes. Within the Northeast Gulf of Mexico, causes of population trends are poorly understood and currently there is no active management of horseshoe crabs. Horseshoe crabs within M,xico have conservation protection based on limited and fragmented habitat and geographic isolation from other regions, but elevated risk applies to the horseshoe crabs in the Yucatan Peninsula region until sufficient data can confirm population stability. Future species status throughout its range will depend on the effectiveness of conservation to mitigate habitat loss and manage for sustainable harvest among and within regions.

AB The interplay of ecology and evolution has been a rich area of research for decades. A surge of interest in this area was catalyzed by the observation that evolution by natural selection can operate at the same contemporary timescales as ecological dynamics. Specifically, recent eco-evolutionary research focuses on how rapid adaptation influences ecology, and vice versa. Evolution by non adaptive forces also occurs quickly, with ecological consequences, but understanding the full scope of ecology-evolution (eco-evo) interactions requires explicitly addressing population-level processes - genetic and demographic. We show the strong ecological effects of non-adaptive evolutionary forces and, more broadly, the value of population-level research for gaining a mechanistic understanding of eco-evo interactions. The breadth of eco-evolutionary research should expand to incorporate the breadth of evolution itself.

AB Water scarcity is an expanding climate and human related condition, which drives and interacts with other stressors in freshwater ecosystems such as chemical pollution. In this study we provide an overview of the existing knowledge regarding the chemical fate, biological dynamics and the ecological risks of chemicals underwater scarcity conditions. We evaluated a total of 15 studies dealing with the combined effects of chemicals and water scarcity under laboratory conditions and in the field. The results of these studies have been elaborated in order to evaluate additive, synergistic or antagonistic responses of the studied endpoints. As a general rule, it can be concluded that, in situations of water scarcity, the impacts of extreme water fluctuations are much more relevant than those of an additional chemical stressor. Nevertheless, the presence of chemical pollution may result in exacerbated ecological risks in some particular cases. We conclude that further investigations on this topic would take advantage on the focus on some specific issues. Experimental (laboratory and model ecosystem) studies should be performed on different biota groups and life stages (diapausing eggs, immature stages), with particular attention to those including traits relevant for the adaptation to water scarcity. More knowledge on species adaptations and recovery capacity is essential to predict community responses to multiple stressors and to assess the community vulnerability. Field studies should be performed at different scales, particularly in lotic systems, in order to integrate different functional dynamics of the river ecosystem. Combining field monitoring and experimental studies would be the best option to reach more conclusive, causal relationships on the effects of co-occurring stressors. Contribution of these studies to develop ecological models and scenarios is also suggested as an improvement for the prospective aquatic risk assessment of chemicals in (semi-) arid areas.

AB The use of conservation translocations to mitigate human effects on biodiversity is increasing, but how these efforts are allocated remains unclear. Based on a comprehensive literature review and online author survey, we sought to determine the goals of translocation efforts, whether they focus on species and regions with high threat and likelihood of perceived success, and how success might be improved. We systematically searched the ISI Web of Knowledge and Academic Search Complete databases to determine the species and regions of conservation translocations and found 1863 articles on conservation translocations in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Central America, and Caribbean published from 1974 to 2013. We questioned 330 relevant authors to determine the motivation for translocations, how translocations were evaluated, and obstacles encountered. Conservation translocations in North America were geographically widespread (in 21 countries), increased in frequency over time for all animal classes (from 1 in 1974 to 84 in 2013), and included 279 different species. Reintroductions and reinforcements were more common in the United States than in Canada and Mexico, Central America, or the Caribbean, and their prevalence was correlated with the number of species at risk at national and state or provincial levels. Translocated species had a higher threat status at state and provincial levels than globally (International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List categorization), suggesting that translocations may have been motivated by regional priorities rather than global risk. Our survey of authors was consistent with these results; most translocations were requested, supported, or funded by government agencies and downlisting species at national or state or provincial levels was the main goal. Nonetheless, downlisting was the least reported measure of success, whereas survival and reproduction of translocated individuals were the most reported. Reported barriers to success included biological factors such as animal mortality and nonbiological factors, such as financial constraints, which were less often considered in the selection of release sites. Our review thus highlights discrepancies between project goals and evaluation criteria and between risk factors considered and obstacles encountered, indicating room to further optimize translocation projects.
   La Alineacion de la Amenaza, el Esfuerzo y el Exito Percibido en las Translocaciones para Conservacion en America del Norte El uso de las translocaciones para conservacion y mitigar los efectos humanos sobre la biodiversidad esta incrementando, pero aun no es claro como se asignan estos esfuerzos. Con base en una revision integral de literatura y una encuesta de autor en linea buscamos determinar los objetivos de los esfuerzos de translocacion, ya sea que se enfoquen en especies y regiones con una amenaza mayor y una probabilidad de exito percibido y como el exito puede mejorarse. Buscamos sistematicamente las bases de datos completas de la Red de Conocimiento y Busqueda Academica ISI para determinar las especies y regiones de las translocaciones para conservacion y encontramos 1,863 articulos sobre translocaciones para conservacion en los Estados Unidos, Canada, Mexico, America Central y el Caribe, publicados entre 1974 y 2013. Consultamos a 330 autores relevantes para determinar los motivos de las translocaciones, como fueron evaluadas y los obstaculos a los que se enfrentaron. Las translocaciones para conservacion en America del Norte estaban dispersas geograficamente (en 21 paises), incrementaron su frecuencia con el tiempo para todas las clases animales (de una en 1974 a 84 en 2013) e incluyeron a 279 especies diferentes. Las reintroducciones y los refuerzos fueron mas comunes en los Estados Unidos que en Canada, Mexico, America Central o el Caribe, y su prevalencia estuvo correlacionada con el numero de especies en riesgo a nivel nacional, estatal o provincial. Las especies reubicadas tenian un mayor estado de amenaza a nivel estatal y provincial que a nivel global (categorias de la Lista Roja de la Union Internacion para la Conservacion de la Naturaleza), lo que sugiere que las reubicaciones podrian haber estado motivadas por prioridades regionales en lugar del riesgo global. Nuestra encuesta a los autores fue consistente con estos resultados ya que la mayoria de las reubicaciones fueron solicitadas, apoyadas o financiadas por agencias del gobierno y bajar la categoria de la especie a nivel nacional, estatal o provincial era el objetivo principal. Sin embargo, bajar la categoria fue la medida de exito menos reportada. Los obstaculos para el exito reportados incluyeron factores biologicos, como la mortalidad animal, y factores no biologicos, como las restricciones financieras, que fueron menos considerados en la seleccion de los sitios de liberacion. Nuestra revision resalta asi las discrepancias entre los objetivos del proyecto y los criterios de evaluacion y entre los factores de riesgo considerados y los obstaculos enfrentados, lo que indica que existe espacio para optimizar aun mas los proyectos de reubicacion.

AB Previous studies of the impacts of climate change on lichens and fungi have focused largely on alpine and subalpine habitats, and have not investigated the potential impact on narrowly endemic species. Here, we estimate the impacts of climate change on high-elevation, endemic lichens in the southern Appalachians, a global diversity hotspot for many groups of organisms, including lichens. We conducted extensive field surveys in the high elevations of the region to accurately document the current distributions of eight narrowly endemic lichen species. Species distribution modeling was used to predict how much climatically suitable area will remain within, and north of, the current range of the target species under multiple climate change scenarios at two time points in the future. Our field work showed that target species ranged from extreme rarity to locally abundant. Models predicted over 93 % distributional loss for all species investigated and very little potentially suitable area north of their current distribution in the coming century. Our results indicate that climate change poses a significant threat to high-elevation lichens, and provide a case study in the application of current modeling techniques for rare, montane species.

AB Changes in streamflow are an important area of ongoing research in the hydrologic sciences. To better understand spatial patterns in past changes in streamflow, we examined relationships between watershed-scale spatial characteristics and trends in streamflow. Trends in streamflow were identified by analyzing mean daily flow observations between 1940 and 2009 from 967 U.S. Geological Survey stream gages. Results indicated that streamflow across the continental U.S., as a whole, increased while becoming less extreme between 1940 and 2009. However, substantial departures from the continental U.S. (CONUS) scale pattern occurred at the regional scale, including increased annual maxima, decreased annual minima, overall drying trends, and changes in streamflow variability. A subset of watersheds belonging to a reference data set exhibited significantly smaller trend magnitudes than those observed in nonreference watersheds. Boosted regression tree models were applied to examine the influence of watershed characteristics on streamflow trend magnitudes at both the CONUS and regional scale. Geographic location was found to be of particular importance at the CONUS scale while local variability in hydroclimate and topography tended to have a strong influence on regional-scale patterns in streamflow trends. This methodology facilitates detailed, data-driven analyses of how the characteristics of individual watersheds interact with large-scale hydroclimate forces to influence how changes in streamflow manifest.

AB Background: Phylogeographic research has advanced in South America, with increasing efforts on taxa from the dry diagonal biomes. However, the diversification of endemic fauna from the semiarid Caatinga biome in northeastern Brazil is still poorly known. Here we targeted saxicolous lizards of the Tropidurus semitaeniatus species group to better understand the evolutionary history of these endemic taxa and the Caatinga. We estimated a time-calibrated phylogeny for the species group based on two mitochondrial and two nuclear genes and jointly estimated the species limits and species tree within the group. We also devoted a denser phylogeographic sampling of the T. semitaeniatus complex to explore migration patterns, and the spatiotemporal diffusion history to verify a possible role of the Sao Francisco River as a promoter of differentiation in this saxicolous group of lizards.
   Results: Phylogenetic analysis detected high cryptic genetic diversity, occurrence of unique microendemic lineages associated with older highlands, and a speciation history that took place during the Pliocene-Pleistocene transition. Species delimitation detected five evolutionary entities within the T. semitaeniatus species group, albeit with low support. Thus, additional data are needed for a more accurate definition of species limits and interspecific relationships within this group. Spatiotemporal analyses reconstructed the geographic origin of the T. semitaeniatus species complex to be located north of the present-day course of the Sao Francisco River, followed by dispersal that expanded its distribution towards the northwest and south. Gene flow estimates showed higher migration rates into the lineages located north of the Sao Francisco River.
   Conclusions: The phylogenetic and population structures are intrinsically associated with stable rock surfaces and landscape rearrangements, such as the establishment of drainage basins located to the northern and southern distribution ranges. The T. semitaeniatus complex preserved high genetic diversity during range expansion, possibly as a result of frequent long-distance dispersal events. Our results indicate that both the current course of the Sao Francisco River and its paleo-courses had an important role in promoting diversification of the Caatinga endemic T. semitaeniatus species group.

AB Biological invasion is one of the key threats to the conservation of the broader Antarctic region. We provide an evidence-based assessment of the status of biological invasion in the region as a basis for future monitoring and management. We adapted the indicator framework for global biological invasion monitoring by collating information on (i) numbers of alien species and those invasive species impacting biodiversity (ii) trends in the extinction risks of native species impacted by invasive species and (iii) trends in relevant agreements, management intention and species eradications. Drivers of invasion including risk-associated human activities and trends were also evaluated. The number and trends in activities associated with invasion risk are broadly distributed across the region and increasing. Over 560 alien species from a wide range of taxa occupy the region, concentrated largely on the Southern Ocean Islands, with a high proportion of these considered to be invasive and to have negative biodiversity impacts. There has been a decline in the conservation status of species in the region that are impacted by invasives. Although policy responses to deal with the problem have increased since the 1970s, as have the number of successful eradications, management implementation statistics are patchy and progress in this area less apparent. The Antarctic Biological Invasions Indicator (ABII) provides a system for information exchange across the region and a vehicle for targeted monitoring and surveillance. It also enables inclusion of the region in global efforts to track both IAS and interventions for managing the threat. In a region that appears particularly prone to impacts from alien species, substantial further effort is needed to implement and monitor the effectiveness of management responses.

ID FUEL MOISTURE; INDEX
AB The moisture content of vegetation and litter (fuel moisture) is an important determinant of fire risk, and predictions of dead fine fuel moisture content (fuel with a diameter <25.4 mm) are particularly important. A variety of indices, as well as empirical and mechanistic models, have been proposed to predict fuel moisture, but these approaches have seldom been validated across temporally extensive datasets, or widely contrasting vegetation types. Here, we describe a semi-mechanistic model, based on the exponential decline of fuel moisture content with atmospheric vapor pressure deficit, that predicts daily minimum fuel moisture content. We calibrated the model at one site in New South Wales, Australia, and validated it at three contrasting ecosystem types in California, USA, where 10-h fuel moisture content was continuously measured every 30 min over a year. We found that existing drought indices did not accurately predict fuel moisture, and that empirical and equilibrium models provided biased estimates. The mean absolute error (MAE) of the fuel moisture content predicted by our model across sites and years was 3.7%, which was substantially lower than for other, commonly used models. Our model's MAE dropped to 2.9% when fuel moisture was below 20%, and to 1.8% when fuel moisture was below 10%. Our model's MAE was comparable to instrumental MAE (3.1-2.5%), indicating that further improvement may be limited by measurement error. The simplicity, accuracy and precision of our model makes it suitable for a range of applications, such as operational fire management and the prediction of fire risk in vegetation models, without the need for site-specific calibrations.

AB Ecological traps occur when environmental changes cause maladaptive habitat selection. Despite their relevance to metapopulations, ecological traps have been studied predominantly at local scales. How these local impacts scale up to affect the dynamics of spatially structured metapopulations in heterogeneous landscapes remains unexplored. We propose that assessing the metapopulation consequences of traps depends on a variety of factors that can be grouped into four categories: the probability of encounter, the likelihood of selection, the fitness costs of selection and species-specific vulnerability to these costs. We evaluate six hypotheses using a network-based metapopulation model to explore the relative importance of factors across these categories within a spatial context. Our model suggests (i) traps are most severe when they represent a large proportion of habitats, severely reduce fitness and are highly attractive, and (ii) species with high intrinsic fitness will be most susceptible. We provide the first evidence that (iii) traps may be beneficial for metapopulations in rare instances, and (iv) preferences for natal-like habitats can magnify the effects of traps. Our study provides important insight into the effects of traps at landscape scales, and highlights the need to explicitly consider spatial context to better understand and manage traps within metapopulations.

AB Understanding adaptive genetic responses to climate change is a main challenge for preserving biological diversity. Successful predictive models for climate-driven range shifts of species depend on the integration of information on adaptation, including that derived from genomic studies. Long-lived forest trees can experience substantial environmental change across generations, which results in a much more prominent adaptation lag than in annual species. Here, we show that candidate-gene SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) can be used as predictors of maladaptation to climate in maritime pine (Pinus pinaster Aiton), an outcrossing long-lived keystone tree. A set of 18 SNPs potentially associated with climate, 5 of them involving amino acid-changing variants, were retained after performing logistic regression, latent factor mixed models, and Bayesian analyses of SNP-climate correlations. These relationships identified temperature as an important adaptive driver in maritime pine and highlighted that selective forces are operating differentially in geographically discrete gene pools. The frequency of the locally advantageous alleles at these selected loci was strongly correlated with survival in a common garden under extreme (hot and dry) climate conditions, which suggests that candidate-gene SNPs can be used to forecast the likely destiny of natural forest ecosystems under climate change scenarios. Differential levels of forest decline are anticipated for distinct maritime pine gene pools. Geographically defined molecular proxies for climate adaptation will thus critically enhance the predictive power of range-shift models and help establish mitigation measures for long-lived keystone forest trees in the face of impending climate change.

TI The contrasting N management of two oilseed rape genotypes reveals the
   mechanisms of proteolysis associated with leaf N remobilization and the
   respective contributions of leaves and stems to N storage and
   remobilization during seed filling

AB Background: Oilseed rape is the third largest oleaginous crop in the world but requires high levels of N fertilizer of which only 50% is recovered in seeds. This weak N use efficiency is associated with a low foliar N remobilization, leading to a significant return of N to the soil and a risk of pollution. Contrary to what is observed during senescence in the vegetative stages, N remobilization from stems and leaves is considered efficient during monocarpic senescence. However, the contribution of stems towards N management and the cellular mechanisms involved in foliar remobilization remain largely unknown. To reach this goal, the N fluxes at the whole plant level from bolting to mature seeds and the processes involved in leaf N remobilization and proteolysis were investigated in two contrasting genotypes (Aviso and Oase) cultivated under ample or restricted nitrate supply.
   Results: During seed filling in both N conditions, Oase efficiently allocated the N from uptake to seeds while Aviso favoured a better N remobilization from stems and leaves towards seeds. Nitrate restriction decreased seed yield and oil quality for both genotypes but Aviso had the best seed N filling. Under N limitation, Aviso had a better N remobilization from leaves to stems before the onset of seed filling. Afterwards, the higher N remobilization from stems and leaves of Aviso led to a higher final N amount in seeds. This high leaf N remobilization is associated with a better degradation/export of insoluble proteins, oligopeptides, nitrate and/or ammonia. By using an original method based on the determination of Rubisco degradation in the presence of inhibitors of proteases, efficient proteolysis associated with cysteine proteases and proteasome activities was identified as the mechanism of N remobilization.
   Conclusion: The results confirm the importance of foliar N remobilization after bolting to satisfy seed filling and highlight that an efficient proteolysis is mainly associated with (i) cysteine proteases and proteasome activities and (ii) a fine coordination between proteolysis and export mechanisms. In addition, the stem may act as transient storage organs in the case of an asynchronism between leaf N remobilization and N demand for seed filling.

AB AimTo study the combined effects of climate change on connectivity between marine protected areas (MPAs) and larval supply to the continental shelf.
   LocationThe Mediterranean Sea, where sea surface temperatures are expected to strongly increase by the end of the 21st century, represents an archetypal situation with a dense MPA network but resource overexploitation outside.
   MethodsUsing an individual-based mechanistic model of larval transport, forced with an emission-driven regional climate change scenario for the Mediterranean Sea, we explored the combined effects of changes in hydrodynamics, adult reproductive timing and larval dispersal on the connectivity among MPAs and their ability to seed fished areas with larvae.
   ResultsWe show that, over the period 1970-2099, larval dispersal distances would decrease by 10%, the continental shelf area seeded with larvae would decrease by 3% and the larval retention fraction would increase by 5%, resulting in higher concentration of larvae in smaller areas of the continental shelf. However, connectance within the MPA network would increase by 5% as more northern MPAs would become suitable for reproduction with increasing temperatures. We also show that the effects of changes in adult reproductive timing and larval dispersal on connectivity patterns are additive.
   Main conclusionsClimate change will influence connectivity and the effectiveness of MPA networks, and should receive more attention in future conservation planning and large-scale population dynamics.

AB Most biologists recognize the "species phenomenon" as a real pattern in nature: Biodiversity is characterized by discontinuities between recognizable groups classified as species. Many conservation laws focus on preventing species extinction. However, species are not fixed. Discontinuities evolve gradually and sometimes disappear. Exactly how to define particular species is not always obvious. Hybridization between taxonomic species reminds us that species classification is not a perfect representation of nature. Classification is a model that is very useful, but not adequate in all cases. Conservationists often confront questions about how to apply species-based laws when hybridization confounds classification. Development of sophisticated techniques and nuanced interpretation of data in the basic study of species and speciation has exposed the need for deeper education in genetics and evolution for applied conservationists and decision makers. Here we offer a brief perspective on hybridization and the species problem in conservation. Our intended audience is conservation practitioners and decision-makers more than geneticists and evolutionary biologists. We wish to emphasize that the goals and premises of legislative classification are not identical to those of scientific classification. Sometimes legal classification is required when the best available science indicates that discrete classification is not an adequate model for the case. Establishing legal status and level of protection for hybrids and hybrid populations means choosing from a range of scientifically valid alternatives. Although we should not abandon species-based approaches to conservation, we must recognize their limitations and work to clarify the roles of science and values in ethical and legal decisions

AB Common dolphins, Delphinus sp., are one of the marine mammal species tourism operations in New Zealand focus on. While effects of cetacean-watching activities have previously been examined in coastal regions in New Zealand, this study is the first to investigate effects of commercial tourism and recreational vessels on common dolphins in an open oceanic habitat. Observations from both an independent research vessel and aboard commercial tour vessels operating off the central and east coast Bay of Plenty, North Island, New Zealand were used to assess dolphin behaviour and record the level of compliance by permitted commercial tour operators and private recreational vessels with New Zealand regulations. Dolphin behaviour was assessed using two different approaches to Markov chain analysis in order to examine variation of responses of dolphins to vessels. Results showed that, regardless of the variance in Markov methods, dolphin foraging behaviour was significantly altered by boat interactions. Dolphins spent less time foraging during interactions and took significantly longer to return to foraging once disrupted by vessel presence. This research raises concerns about the potential disruption to feeding, a biologically critical behaviour. This may be particularly important in an open oceanic habitat, where prey resources are typically widely dispersed and unpredictable in abundance. Furthermore, because tourism in this region focuses on common dolphins transiting between adjacent coastal locations, the potential for cumulative effects could exacerbate the local effects demonstrated in this study. While the overall level of compliance by commercial operators was relatively high, non-compliance to the regulations was observed with time restriction, number or speed of vessels interacting with dolphins not being respected. Additionally, prohibited swimming with calves did occur. The effects shown in this study should be carefully considered within conservation management plans, in order to reduce the risk of detrimental effects on common dolphins within the region.

AB Accurate estimates of the duration of power outages caused by hurricanes prior to landfall are valuable for utility companies and government agencies that wish to plan and optimize their restoration efforts. Accurate pre-storm estimates are also important information for customers and operators of other infrastructures systems, who rely heavily on electricity. Traditionally, utilities make restoration plans based on managerial judgment and experience. However, skillful outage forecast models are conducive to improved decision-making practices by utilities and can greatly enhance storm preparation and restoration management procedures of power companies and emergency managers. This paper presents a novel statistical approach for estimating power outage durations that is 87 % more accurate than existing models in the literature. The power outage duration models are developed and carefully validated for outages caused by Hurricanes Dennis, Katrina, and Ivan in a central Gulf Coast state. This paper identifies the key variables in predicting hurricane-induced outage durations and their degree of influence on predicting outage restoration for the utility company service area used as our case study.

AB Evaluation of host-parasitoid associations can be tenuous using conventional methods. Molecular techniques are well placed to identify trophic links and resolve host-parasitoid associations. Establishment of the highly invasive brown marmorated stink bug, Halyomorpha halys (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae), outside Asia has prompted interest in the use of egg parasitoids (Hymenoptera: Scelionidae) as biological control agents. However, little is known regarding their host ranges. To address this, a DNA barcoding approach was taken wherein general PCR primers for Scelionidae and Pentatomidae were developed to amplify and sequence >500-bp products within the DNA barcoding region of the cytochrome oxidase I (COI) gene that would permit the identification of key players in this association. Amplification of DNA from Pentatomidae and Scelionidae was consistent across a broad range of taxa within these families, and permitted the detection of Scelionidae eggs within H. halys 1 h following oviposition. In laboratory assays, amplification and sequencing of DNA from empty, parasitized eggs was successful for both host (100% success) and parasitoid (50% success). When applied to field-collected, empty egg masses, the primers permitted host identification in 50-100% of the eggs analysed, and yielded species-level identifications. Parasitoid identification success ranged from 33 to 67% among field-collected eggs, with genus-level identification for most specimens. The inability to obtain species-level identities for these individuals is due to the lack of coverage of this taxonomic group in public DNA sequence databases; this situation is likely to improve as more species are sequenced and recorded in these databases. These primers were able to detect and identify both pentatomid host and scelionid parasitoid in a hyperparasitized egg mass, thereby clarifying trophic links otherwise unresolved by conventional methodology.

AB Spatially explicit capture-recapture methods, used widely to estimate the abundance of large carnivores, allow for movement within home ranges during sampling. Probability of detection is a decreasing function of distance from the home range center, with one parameter for magnitude and another for spatial scale. Sex-based and other differences in home range size potentially cause heterogeneity in individual detection and bias in estimates of density. The two parameters of detection have hitherto been treated as independent, but we suggest that an inverse relation is expected when detection probability depends on time spent near the detector. Variation in the spatial scale of detection is then compensated by reciprocal variation in the magnitude parameter. We define a net measure of detection (single-detector sampling area, a(0)), and show by simulation that its coefficient of variation (CV) is a better predictor of bias than the CV of either component or the sum of their squared CVs. In an example using the grizzly bear Ursus arctos, the estimated sex variation in a(0) was small despite large variation in each component. From the simulations, the relative bias of density estimates was generally negligible (<5%) when CV(a(0)) < 30%. Parameterization of the detection model in terms of a(0) and spatial scale can be more parsimonious and significantly aids the biological interpretation of detection parameters.

AB Daily values of McArthur Forest Fire Danger Index were generated at similar to 10-km resolution over Tasmania, Australia, from six dynamically downscaled CMIP3 climate models for 1961-2100, using a high (A2) emissions scenario. Multi-model mean fire danger validated well against observations for 2002-2012, with 99th percentile fire dangers having the same distribution and largely similar values to those observed over the same time. Model projections showed a broad increase in fire danger across Tasmania, but with substantial regional variation - the increase was smaller in western Tasmania (district mean cumulative fire danger increasing at 1.07 per year) compared with parts of the east (1.79 per year), for example. There was also noticeable seasonal variation, with little change occurring in autumn, but a steady increase in area subject to springtime 99th percentile fire danger from 6% in 1961-1980 to 21% by 2081-2100, again consistent with observations. In general, annually accumulated fire danger behaved similarly. Regional mean sea level pressure patterns resembled observed patterns often associated with days of dangerous fire weather. Days of elevated fire danger displaying these patterns increased in frequency during the simulated twenty-first century: in south-east Tasmania, for example, the number of such events detected rose from 101 (across all models) in 1961-1980 to 169 by 2081-2100. Correspondence of model output with observations and the regional detail available suggest that these dynamically downscaled model data are useful projections of future fire danger for landscape managers and the community.

AB Concerns about bycatch of protected species have become a dominant factor shaping fisheries management. However, efforts to mitigate bycatch are often hindered by a lack of data on the distributions of fishing effort and protected species. One approach to overcoming this problem has been to overlay the distribution of past fishing effort with known locations of protected species, often obtained through satellite telemetry and occurrence data, to identify potential bycatch hotspots. This approach, however, generates static bycatch risk maps, calling into question their ability to forecast into the future, particularly when dealing with spatiotemporally dynamic fisheries and highly migratory bycatch species. In this study, we use boosted regression trees to model the spatiotemporal distribution of fishing effort for two distinct fisheries in the North Pacific Ocean, the albacore (Thunnus alalunga) troll fishery and the California drift gillnet fishery that targets swordfish (Xiphias gladius). Our results suggest that it is possible to accurately predict fishing effort using <10 readily available predictor variables (cross-validated correlations between model predictions and observed data approximate to 0.6). Although the two fisheries are quite different in their gears and fishing areas, their respective models had high predictive ability, even when input data sets were restricted to a fraction of the full time series. The implications for conservation and management are encouraging: Across a range of target species, fishing methods, and spatial scales, even a relatively short time series of fisheries data may suffice to accurately predict the location of fishing effort into the future. In combination with species distribution modeling of bycatch species, this approach holds promise as a mitigation tool when observer data are limited. Even in data-rich regions, modeling fishing effort and bycatch may provide more accurate estimates of bycatch risk than partial observer coverage for fisheries and bycatch species that are heavily influenced by dynamic oceanographic conditions.

AB Finding common ground between local residents' livelihoods and the conservation of protected areas in developing countries has been considered a challenge. Recently, ecosystem services have been used as a framework to understand the benefits that protected areas provide local residents. In this study, we explore the role of ecosystem services in residents' relationships with Gaoligongshan Nature Reserve (GNR) in Yunnan, China. GNR is located in a biodiversity hotspot and in an area that has been affected severe droughts. Results show that the majority of people recognize ecosystem services as benefits from GNR, particularly regulating services such as the provision of water. Respondents who perceived regulating services were more likely to be older, male, of Yi ethnicity, more educated, and grow sugarcane but not corn. However, controlling for residents' knowledge about GNR, the effects of gender, age, and education decrease or disappear, while ethnicity and agricultural crops grown remain significant. This study demonstrates that people recognize common ground between their livelihoods and GNR and suggests that people's knowledge about GNR, cultural context, and agricultural experiences influence their appreciation of ecosystem services from GNR. This study highlights that protected area conservation, if conducted with awareness of people's already-existing perceptions of benefits, can begin with a discussion of win-win scenarios.

AB Understanding and analysis of drivers of land-use and -cover change (LUCC) is a requisite to reduce and manage impacts and consequences of LUCC. The aim of the present study is to analyze drivers of LUCC in Southern Mexico and to see how these are used by different conceptual and methodological approaches for generating transition potential maps and how this influences the effectiveness to produce reliable LUCC models. Spatial factors were tested for their relation to main LUCC processes, and their importance as drivers for the periods 1993-2002 and 2002-2007 was evaluated by hierarchical partitioning analysis and logistic regression models. Tested variables included environmental and biophysical variables, location measures of infrastructure and of existing land use, fragmentation, and demographic and social variables. The most important factors show a marked persistence over time: deforestation is mainly driven by the distance of existing land uses; degradation and regeneration by the distance of existing disturbed forests. Nevertheless, the overall number of important factors decreases slightly for the second period. These drivers were used to produce transition potential maps calibrated with the 1993-2002 data by two different approaches: (1) weights of evidence (WoE) to represent the probabilities of dominant change processes, namely deforestation, forest degradation, and forest regeneration for temperate and tropical forests and (2) logistic RM that show the suitability regarding the different land-use and -cover (LUC) classes. Validation of the transition potential maps with the 2002-2007 data indicates a low precision with large differences between LUCC processes and methods. Areas of change evaluated by difference in potential showed that WoE produce transition potential maps that are more accurate for predicting LUCC than those produced with RM. Relative operating characteristic (ROC) statistics show that transition potential models based on RM do usually better predict areas of no change, but the difference is rather small. The poor performance of maps based on RM could be attributed to their too general representation of suitability for certain LUC classes when the goal is modeling complex LUCC and the LUC classes participate in several transitions. The application of a multimodel approach enables to better understand the relations of drivers to LUCC and the evaluation of model calibration based on spatial explanatory factors. This improved understanding of the capacity of LUCC models to produce accurate predictions is important for making better informed policy assessments and management recommendations to reduce deforestation.

AB Urbanization is a growing threat to ecological communities and has become a leading cause of population extirpations in a wide range of taxa. Because the effects of urbanization are often multifaceted, identifying the pathways through which changes in communities occur has remained a persistent challenge. We draw upon metacommunity theory to evaluate competing explanations for the effects of urbanization, focusing on the relative importance of processes at local (e.g. abiotic and biotic characteristics) and regional (e.g. habitat connectivity and dispersal) scales. Over 4years, we sampled 201 wetlands in the Front Range region of Colorado, which is one of the most rapidly developing areas in the USA. Wetlands embedded within urban areas exhibited significantly lower taxonomic richness and diversity compared to those in agricultural or grassland areas. Relative to grassland wetlands, urban wetlands supported a 60% lower richness of amphibians and aquatic reptiles and a 33% lower richness of aquatic insects, molluscs and crayfish. These patterns were associated with changes in biotic factors (introduced fishes and bullfrogs), abiotic factors (nutrients, conductivity and vegetation) and landscape characteristics (road density and surrounding wetland area). The use of an information-theoretic approach and structural equation modelling suggested that the effects of urbanization on richness were mainly driven by changes in road density. Analyses of community composition indicated that discrete communities formed along the urban systems gradient, such that actively dispersing predators associated more negatively with urban system relative to herbivores with passive dispersal. Synthesis and applications. These results highlight the importance of considering both local and regional factors in addressing conservation-related challenges and underscore the benefits of linking conceptual work on metacommunity theory with applied efforts to mitigate the effects of urbanization.

AB Robust approaches to natural resource management (NRM) in indigenous cross-cultural contexts require coherent understandings of Indigenous Ecological Knowledge (IEK) systems. We synthesize a framework to represent the traditionally derived worldview of Arrernte Aboriginal people within which IEK is embedded. This is an ecology-focused worldview with three interrelated domains of knowledge that are intricately linked, comprising many complex dynamic elements that interact with each other. This worldview is from desert Australia but is relevant to those working in complex cross-cultural environments across Australia and internationally. The visual framework presented fills an important conceptual gap in IEK documentation being positioned at a mesoconceptual scale. Comparisons between this knowledge framework and social-ecological systems theory indicate similarities in systems thinking, in explicit links between people and ecology, and in the emphasis on processes and relationships through causal loops and feedbacks. Important differences lie in the inextricable integration of economic and spiritual domains in the Arrernte worldview. In Arrernte eyes, interrelationships between people, resource species, land, and spiritual domains are central to NRM. Scientific approaches commonly overlook or segregate elements of indigenous knowledge. The multiple values indigenous people attribute to species are often ignored or overridden, which contributes to decoupling within their knowledge system. Western scientists and natural resource managers are looking for better understandings of indigenous knowledge systems. The framework offers a tool that can be applied to both cross-cultural and intergenerational learning to improve NRM and people's well-being and sense of self.

AB Background: Regardless of the growing interest in detecting population structures in malarial parasites, there have been limited discussions on how to use this concept in control programmes. In such context, the effects of the parasite population structures will depend on interventions' spatial or temporal scales. This investigation explores the problem of identifying genetic markers, in this case microsatellites, to unveil Plasmodium genetic structures that could affect decisions in the context of elimination. The study was performed in a low-transmission area, which offers a good proxy to better understand problems associated with surveillance at the final stages of malaria elimination.
   Methods: Plasmodium vivax samples collected in Tumeremo, Venezuela, between March 2003 and November 2004 were analysed. Since Plasmodium falciparum also circulates in many low endemic areas, P. falciparum samples from the same locality and time period were included for comparison. Plasmodium vivax samples were assayed for an original set of 25 microsatellites and P. falciparum samples were assayed for 12 microsatellites.
   Results: Not all microsatellite loci assayed offered reliable local data. A complex temporal-cluster dynamics is found in both P. vivax and P. falciparum. Such dynamics affect the numbers and the type of microsatellites required for identifying individual parasites or parasite clusters when performing cross-sectional studies. The minimum number of microsatellites required to differentiate circulating P. vivax clusters differs from the minimum number of hyper-variable microsatellites required to distinguish individuals within these clusters. Regardless the extended number of microsatellites used in P. vivax, it was not possible to separate all individual infections.
   Conclusions: Molecular surveillance has great potential; however, it requires preliminary local studies in order to properly interpret the emerging patterns in the context of elimination. Clonal expansions and clusters turnovers need to be taken into account when using molecular markers. Those affect the number and type of microsatellite markers, as well as, the expected genetic patterns in the context of operational investigations. By considering the local dynamics, elimination programmes could cost-effectively use molecular markers. However, population level studies need to consider the local limitations of a given set of loci in terms of providing epidemiologically relevant information.

AB Temporary rivers are shifting mosaics of aquatic and terrestrial habitat driven by hydrologic variability. Advancing wetted fronts (AWFs) that rewet dry river beds are unpredictable events, and knowledge about their composition and role in habitat mosaics is scarce. We collected dead and living terrestrial invertebrates, aquatic invertebrates, and sestonic matter (i.e., suspended sediments and organic matter) entrained by flow in an AWF travelling downstream over a 7-km-long dry reach. We collected samples at 12 sites along the rewetting reach and at 3 sites in the upstream perennial reach of the Albarine River, France. Invertebrates in the AWF were mainly of terrestrial origin and organic matter was essentially coarse (>5 mm). Terrestrial invertebrate density and taxonomic richness and sestonic matter concentration were several orders of magnitude higher in the AWF than in the perennial reach. However, only terrestrial invertebrate taxonomic richness increased longitudinally. At least 1/3 of terrestrial taxa could have survived submersion, and the density and taxonomic richness of these taxa decreased downstream. These results indicate that terrestrially derived material is stored downstream during rewetting where it could greatly stimulate in-stream aquatic productivity and succession in terrestrial invertebrates along the riparian zone. In contrast, entrained aquatic taxa represented similar to 15% of the benthic taxa collected 1 mo after rewetting, indicating a low contribution of AWFs to benthic invertebrate succession. In the context of global change and increasing appropriation of water resources by humans, our results suggest that conceptual models of invertebrate dynamic and organic matter processing in rivers should account for dry phases and transitional periods from dry to wet conditions.

AB An enduring problem in avian ecology and conservation is linking breeding and wintering grounds of migratory species. As migratory species and populations vary in the degree to which individuals from distinct breeding locales mix on stop-over sites and wintering grounds, establishing migratory connectivity informs our understanding of population demography and species management. We present a new Bayesian approach for inferring breeding grounds of wintering birds of unknown origins in North America. We incorporate prior information from analysis of genetic markers into geographic origin assignment based upon stable-hydrogen isotope analysis of feathers (delta H-2(f)), using the Loggerhead Shrike (Lanius ludovicianus). Likely geographic origins derived from analyses of DNA microsatellites were used as priors for Bayesian analyses in which birds were assigned to a breeding-ground origin using their delta H-2(f) values. As with most applications of Bayesian methods, our approach greatly improved the results (i.e. decreased the size of the potential area of origin). Area of origin decreased by 3 to 5-fold on average, but ranged up to a 10-fold improvement. We recommend this approach in future studies of migratory connectivity and suggest that our methodology could be applied more broadly to the study of dispersal, sources of productivity of migratory populations, and a range of evolutionary phenomena.

AB Aim The physical and physiological mechanisms that determine tree-line position are reasonably well understood, but explanations for tree species-specific upper elevational limits below the tree line are still lacking. In addition, once these uppermost positions have been identified, questions arise over whether they reflect past expansion events or active ongoing recruitment or even upslope migration. The aims of this study were: (1) to assess current tree recruitment near the cold-temperature limit of 10 major European tree species in the Swiss Alps, and (2) to rank species by the extent that their seedlings and saplings exceed the elevational limit of adult trees, possibly reflecting effects of the recent climate warming. Location Western and eastern Alps of Switzerland. Methods For each species, occurrences were recorded along six elevational transects according to three size classes from seedlings to adult trees in 25-m-elevation steps above and below their regional upper elevational limit. Two methods were used to compare upper elevational limits between seedlings, saplings and adults within species. First, we focused on the uppermost occurrence observed in each life stage for a given species within each studied region; and second, we predicted their upper distribution range using polynomial models fitted to presence/absence data. Results Species exhibited a clear ranking in their elevational limit. Regional differences in species limits (western versus eastern Swiss Alps) could largely be attributed to regional differences in temperature. Observed and predicted limits of each life stage showed that all species were represented by young individuals in the vicinity of the limit of adult trees. Moreover, tree recruitment of both seedlings and saplings was detected and predicted significantly beyond adult tree limits in most of the species. Across regions, seedlings and saplings were on average found at elevations 73 m higher than adult trees. Main conclusions Under current conditions, neither seed dispersal nor seedling establishment constitutes a serious limitation of recruitment at the upper elevational limits of major European trees. The recruits found beyond the adult limits demonstrate the potential for an upward migration of trees in the Alps in response to ongoing climate warming.

AB Geographic surveys of allozymes, microsatellites, nuclear DNA (nDNA) and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) have detected several genetic subdivisions among European anchovy populations. However, these studies have been limited in their power to detect some aspects of population structure by the use of a single or a few molecular markers, or by limited geographic sampling. We use a multi-marker approach, 47 nDNA and 15 mtDNA single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), to analyze 626 European anchovies from the whole range of the species to resolve shallow and deep levels of population structure. Nuclear SNPs define 10 genetic entities within two larger genetically distinctive groups associated with oceanic variables and different life-history traits. MtDNA SNPs define two deep phylogroups that reflect ancient dispersals and colonizations. These markers define two ecological groups. One major group of Iberian-Atlantic populations is associated with upwelling areas on narrow continental shelves and includes populations spawning and overwintering in coastal areas. A second major group includes northern populations in the North East (NE) Atlantic (including the Bay of Biscay) and the Mediterranean and is associated with wide continental shelves with local larval retention currents. This group tends to spawn and overwinter in oceanic areas. These two groups encompass ten populations that differ from previously defined management stocks in the Alboran Sea, Iberian-Atlantic and Bay of Biscay regions. In addition, a new North Sea-English Channel stock is defined. SNPs indicate that some populations in the Bay of Biscay are genetically closer to North Western (NW) Mediterranean populations than to other populations in the NE Atlantic, likely due to colonizations of the Bay of Biscay and NW Mediterranean by migrants from a common ancestral population. Northern NE Atlantic populations were subsequently established by migrants from the Bay of Biscay. Populations along the Iberian-Atlantic coast appear to have been founded by secondary waves of migrants from a southern refuge.

AB We investigated whether the degree of light inhibition of leaf respiration (R) differs among large Eucalyptus saligna grown in whole-tree chambers and exposed to present and future atmospheric [CO2] and summer drought. Associated with month-to-month changes in temperature were concomitant changes in R in the light (Rlight) and darkness (Rdark), with both processes being more temperature dependent in well-watered trees than under drought. Overall rates of Rlight and Rdark were not significantly affected by [CO2]. By contrast, overall rates of Rdark (averaged across both [CO2]) were ca. 25% lower under drought than in well-watered trees. During summer, the degree of light inhibition of leaf R was greater in droughted (ca. 80% inhibition) than well-watered trees (ca. 50% inhibition). Notwithstanding these treatment differences, an overall positive relationship was observed between Rlight and Rdark when data from all months/treatments were combined (R2 = 0.8). Variations in Rlight were also positively correlated with rates of Rubisco activity and nitrogen concentration. Light inhibition resulted in a marked decrease in the proportion of light-saturated photosynthesis respired (i.e. reduced R/Asat). Collectively, these results highlight the need to account for light inhibition when assessing impacts of global change drivers on the carbon economy of tree canopies.

AB We investigated how photosynthesis by understory seedlings of the lowland tropical tree species Alseis blackiana responded to 10 years of soil nutrient fertilization with N, P and K. We ask whether nutrients are limiting to light and CO2 acquisition in a low light understory environment. We measured foliar nutrient concentrations of N, P and K, isotopic composition of carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15), and light response curves of photosynthesis and chlorophyll fluorescence. Canopy openness was measured above each study seedling and included in statistical analyses to account for variation in light availability. Foliar N concentration increased by 20% with N addition. Foliar P concentration increased by 78% with P addition and decreased by 14% with N addition. Foliar K increased by 8% with K addition. Foliar delta C-13 showed no significant responses, and foliar delta N-15 decreased strongly with N addition, matching the low delta N-15 values of applied fertilizer. Canopy openness ranged from 0.01 to 6.71% with a mean of 1.76 +/- 0.14 (+/- 1SE). Maximum photosynthetic CO2 assimilation rate increased by 9% with N addition. Stomatal conductance increased with P addition and with P and K in combination. Chlorophyll fluorescence measurements revealed that quantum yield of photosystem II increased with K addition, maximum electron transport rate trended 9% greater with N addition (p = 0.07), and saturating photosynthetically active radiation increased with N addition. The results demonstrate that nutrient addition can enhance photosynthetic processes, even under low light availability.

TI Reframing the debate over assisted colonization
SO FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID CLIMATE-CHANGE; ECOLOGICAL RESTORATION; MANAGED RELOCATION;
   CONSERVATION; FACE; MIGRATION
AB Assisted colonization - also known as managed relocation or assisted migration - is one way of facilitating range shifts for species that are restricted in their ability to move in response to climate or other environmental changes. Over the past decade, a healthy debate has evolved in the scientific community over the costs and benefits of assisted colonization as a climate-adaptation strategy. This discussion has focused largely on the specific risks and benefits of intentionally moving species, and has led to the development of multiple frameworks and numerous recommendations for weighing and evaluating these factors. Here, we argue that this debate is, in part, misguided, and that a more productive discussion would result if the issue were reframed in light of (1) the goals of assisted colonization, (2) the realities of projected climate impacts, and (3) the use of complementary adaptation strategies, such as enhancing landscape connectivity.

AB Water stress in Mediterranean countries is the result of both variable and changing climatic conditions and widespread anthropogenic pressures. Evrotas, an intermittent river located in Southern Greece, was used as a case study to assess the impacts of water stress on Mediterranean lotic ecosystems. Based on hydrological analyses, it was revealed that during prolonged drought years, such as the summers of 2007 and 2008, the vast majority of the Evrotas riverbed was completely desiccated, primarily as a result of substantial water abstraction for irrigation. The effects of desiccation on the riverine ecosystem were evaluated using fish and macroinvertebrate assemblages according to the demands of the Water Framework Directive 2000/60/EC (WFD). Faunal responses to water stress were assessed through comparisons of assemblages attributes in perennial and intermittent reaches and pre-drought versus post-drought communities. Effects of hydrological disturbance on fish species richness, density, percentage composition and size structure were more pronounced in intermittent than in perennial sites. The most obvious and immediate impact was the elimination of populations in the intermittent reaches. However, upon flow resumption, the recolonisation from upstream perennial reaches began, thereby permitting partial re-establishment of the depleted fish communities. Nevertheless, the structural integrity of fish communities remained severely impacted and recovery was markedly slow. On the contrary, post-drought macroinvertebrate assemblages were not affected by summer droughts, and the recruitment processes were rapid after flow resumption. Our findings point to the necessity of establishing a distinction between naturally and artificially driven intermittent rivers. We, therefore, propose the introduction of an "artificially intermittent Mediterranean river" condition within the context of the WFD assessment applications.

AB The Mediterranean bath sponge Spongia officinalis is an iconic species with high socioeconomic value and precarious future owing to unregulated harvesting, mortality incidents and lack of established knowledge regarding its ecology. This study aims to assess genetic diversity and population structure of the species at different geographical scales throughout its distribution. For this purpose, 11 locations in the Eastern Mediterranean (Aegean Sea), Western Mediterranean (Provence coast) and the Strait of Gibraltar were sampled; specimens were analysed using partial mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) sequences, along with a set of eight microsatellite loci. According to our results (i) no genetic differentiation exists among the acknowledged Mediterranean morphotypes, and hence, S. officinalis can be viewed as a single, morphologically variable species; (ii) a notable divergence was recorded in the Gibraltar region, indicating the possible existence of a cryptic species; (iii) restriction to gene flow was evidenced between the Aegean Sea and Provence giving two well-defined regional clusters, thus suggesting the existence of a phylogeographic break between the two systems; (iv) low levels of genetic structure, not correlated to geographical distance, were observed inside geographical sectors, implying mechanisms (natural or anthropogenic) that enhance dispersal and gene flow have promoted population connectivity; (v) the genetic diversity of S. officinalis is maintained high in most studied locations despite pressure from harvesting and the influence of devastating epidemics. These findings provide a basis towards the effective conservation and management of the species.

Notohikari). Plants were grown for 70 days hydroponically in artificially illuminated growth chambers at a p[CO2] of either 39 or 100 Pa at N 2 mM. Leaf A, V-c,V-max, J(max) ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco, E.C.4.1.1.39). mRNA for associated genes rbcS and rbcL, total N and carbohydrate concentrations in leaves at different positions in the canopy were measured. Spatial allocation of N and Rubisco synthesis of expanding leaf blade was also measured from the leaf ligule to tip of the leaf blade. Growth at elevated p[CO2] suppressed light saturated A, V-c,V-max, and J(max), in leaf blades at all positions in the canopy. The suppression of A was 15% for the upper leaf blades compared to 37% in the lower leaf blades. Similar reductions in the amount of Rubisco, Chlorophyll, and total N were observed in the leaves of the plants grown in 100 p[CO2] compared to the 39 p[CO2]. Sucrose and starch concentration concentrations increased at elevated p[CO2] but we found no relationship between A, Rubisco or the amount of transcript abundance of rbcS and rbcL. Elevated p[CO2] substantially reduced N allocation into expanding leaf blades and this was well correlated with Rubisco synthesis. These results suggest that A acclimation to elevated p[CO2] occurs during all phases of the leaf development, is initiated during the cell maturation process and linked with spatial N allocation into the leaf blade. In addition, elevated p[CO2] accelerated lower leaf blade senescence which compounded the effect on A acclimation. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Leakiness (phi), the proportion of carbon fixed by phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylation that leaks out of the bundle-sheath cells, determines C-4 photosynthetic efficiency. Large increases in phi have been described at low irradiance. The underlying mechanisms for this increase remain uncertain, but changes in photorespiration or the energy partitioning between the C-4 and C-3 cycles have been suggested. Additionally, values of phi at low light could be magnified from assumptions made when comparing measured photosynthetic discrimination against C-13 (Delta) with the theoretical formulation for Delta. For example, several simplifications are often made when modelling Delta to predict phi including: (i) negligible fractionation during photorespiration and dark respiration; (ii) infinite mesophyll conductance; and (iii) CO2 inside bundle-sheath cells (C-s) is much larger than values in mesophyll cells (C-m). Theoretical models for C-4 photosynthesis and C-4 Delta were combined to evaluate how these simplifications affect calculations of Delta and phi at different light intensities. It was demonstrated that the effects of photorespiratory fractionations and mesophyll conductance were negligible at low light. Respiratory fractionation was relevant only when the magnitude of the fractionation factor was artificially increased during measurements. The largest error in estimating phi occurred when assuming C-s was much larger than C-m at low light levels, when bundle-sheath conductance was large (g(s)), or at low O-2 concentrations. Under these conditions, the simplified equation for Delta overestimated phi, and compromised comparisons between species with different g(s), and comparisons across O-2 concentrations.

AB There is strong correlative evidence that human-induced climate warming is contributing to changes in the timing of natural events. Firm attribution, however, requires cause-and-effect links between observed climate change and altered phenology, together with statistical confidence that observed regional climate change is anthropogenic. We provide evidence for phenological shifts in the butterfly Heteronympha merope in response to regional warming in the southeast Australian city of Melbourne. The mean emergence date for H. merope has shifted -1.5 days per decade over a 65-year period with a concurrent increase in local air temperatures of approximately 0.168 degrees C per decade. We used a physiologically based model of climatic influences on development, together with statistical analyses of climate data and global climate model projections, to attribute the response of H. merope to anthropogenic warming. Such mechanistic analyses of phenological responses to climate improve our ability to forecast future climate change impacts on biodiversity.

AB The remarkable geological and evolutionary history of peninsular India has generated much interest in the patterns and processes that might have shaped the current distributions of its endemic biota. In this regard the "Out-of-India" hypothesis, which proposes that rafting peninsular India carried Gondwanan forms to Asia after the break-up of Gondwana super continent, has gained prominence. Here we have reviewed molecular studies undertaken on a range of taxa of supposedly Gondwanan origin to better understand the Out-of-India scenario. This re-evaluation of published molecular studies indicates that there is mounting evidence supporting Out-of-India scenario for various Asian taxa. Nevertheless, in many studies the evidence is inconclusive due to lack of information on the age of relevant nodes. Studies also indicate that not all Gondwanan forms of peninsular India dispersed out of India. Many of these ancient lineages are confined to peninsular India and therefore are relict Gondwanan lineages. Additionally, for some taxa an "Into India" rather than "Out-of-India" scenario better explains their current distribution. To identify the "Out-of-India" component of Asian biota it is imperative that we understand the complex biogeographical history of India. To this end, we propose three oversimplified yet explicit phylogenetic predictions. These predictions can be tested through the use of molecular phylogenetic tools in conjunction with palaeontological and geological data.

AB P>Climate change in cold biomes not only involves higher summer temperatures, but also warmer springs and more winter precipitation. So far, little is known about species responses to these seasonal components of climate change.
   We experimentally manipulated spring and summer temperatures and winter snow accumulation and temperatures independently in a peatland in sub-arctic Sweden. This yielded six climate scenarios and we studied the responses of the peat moss Sphagnum fuscum, the evergreen dwarf shrubs Empetrum hermaphroditum and Andromeda polifolia, the deciduous dwarf shrubs Betula nana and Vaccinium uliginosum, the grass Calamagrostis lapponica and the forb Rubus chamaemorus.
   We found substantial interspecific differences in leaf nutrient and carbon exchange variables that reflect the response of tundra plants to climate change. S. fuscum had the lowest N and P concentrations, with increasing N and P concentrations (and decreasing C/N and C/P ratios) going from evergreen dwarf shrubs, to the grass, deciduous dwarf shrubs and the forb. Leaf N/P ratios varied between 10 and 14 which points to N-limited plant growth.
   The natural abundance of N-15 varied very strongly among species and growth forms. These differences corresponded with the presence and type of mycorrhizal association in the plant roots. Leaf carbon isotope discrimination also differed strongly among species and growth forms, but the absolute differences were relatively small (< 5 parts per thousand). The rank order was: forb and graminoid < moss and evergreen shrubs < deciduous shrubs.
   After 4 years, the effects of realistic climate change manipulations on leaf nutrient and carbon exchange variables were idiosyncratic with respect to species and generally small compared to the differences among species and growth forms. At the phenotypic level, spring warming or winter snow addition effects occurred as frequently as summer warming effects.
   This implies that the changes in the species composition and structure of plant communities that have been observed in medium-term warming studies in cold biomes will have much more impact on plant-mediated nutrient and carbon cycling pathways and rates than climate-change induced phenotypic responses, irrespective of the seasonal timing of these climate changes.

AB Prosimians (tarsiers and strepsirrhini) represent the basal lineages in primates and have a close bearing on the origin of primates. Although major lineages among anthropoidea (humans, apes and monkeys) are well represented by complete mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequence data, only one complete mtDNA sequence from a representative of each of the infraorders in prosimians has been described until quite recently, and therefore we newly determined complete mtDNA sequences from 5 lemurs, 4 lorises, one tarsier and one platyrrhini. These sequences were provided to phylogenetic analyses in combination with the sequences from the 15 primates species reported to the database.
   The position of tarsiers among primates could not be resolved by the maximum likelihood (ML) and neighbor-joining (NJ) analyses with several data sets. As to the position of tarsiers, any of the three alternative topologies (monophyly of haplorhini, monophyly of prosimians, and tarsiers being basal in primates) was not rejected at the significance level of 5%, neither at the nucleotide nor at the amino acid level. In addition, the significant variations of C and T compositions were observed across primates species. Furthermore, we used AGY data sets for phylogenetic analyses in order to remove the effect of different C/T composition bias across species. The analyses of AGY data sets provided a medium support for the monophyly of haplorhini, which might have been screened by the variation in base composition of mtDNA across species.
   To estimates the speciation dates within primates, we analyzed the amino acid sequences of mt-proteins with a Bayesian method of Thorne and Kishino. Divergence dates were estimated as follows for the crown groups: about 35.4 million years ago (mya) for lorisiformes, 55.3 mya for lemuriformes, 64.5 mya for strepsirrhini, 70.1 mya for haplorhini and 76.0 mya for primates. Furthermore, we reexamined the biogeographic scenarios which have been proposed for the origin of strepsirrhini (lemuriformes and lorisiformes) and for the dispersal of the lemuriformes and lorisiformes.

AB Although urban areas only occupy c. 2.8% of the earth's land surface, urbanization threatens biodiversity as areas of high human population density often coincide with high biodiversity. Therefore, nature conservation should concentrate on both remote areas and densely populated regions. Protecting rare plant species in rural and urban areas can contribute to the protection of biodiversity. We therefore need to understand why species are rare. Studies on causes of rarity often concentrate on either plant traits or extrinsic threats (such as habitat fragmentation or nitrogen enrichment). However, there are only a few studies that combine traits and extrinsic threats, although such analyses might clarify causes of rarity. We assessed how the affinity of vascular plant species to urban land use ('urbanity') interacts with plant traits in determining species frequency.
   Germany, resolution c. 12 km x 11 km.
   Species with a low frequency may be rare because they occur in rare habitats or because of other reasons, although their habitat is frequent. Therefore, we calculated the frequency of species corrected for habitat frequency, i.e. relative species frequency. We explained relative species frequency by the interactions of species traits and species affinity to urban land use using generalized linear models. Simultaneous autoregressive error models controlled for phylogenetic relationships of species.
   Relative species frequency depends on species affinity to urban land use, independent of the different interactions between traits and urbanity used as predictors. The higher the urbanity the higher is species frequency. Urbanity interacts with species preferences towards temperature and soil acidity. Moreover, dispersal, nitrogen preferences and origin explain relative species frequency, amongst others.
   Many rare species, especially those preferring cool or acidic habitats might already have disappeared from urban areas. Analyses that combine species traits and environmental effects can explain the causes of rarity and help to derive better conservation strategies.

AB Predicting species distribution is of fundamental importance for ecology and conservation. However, distribution models are usually established for only one region and it is unknown whether they can be transferred to other geographical regions. We studied the distribution of six amphibian species in five regions to address the question of whether the effect of landscape variables varied among regions. We analysed the effect of 10 variables extracted in six concentric buffers (from 100 m to 3 km) describing landscape composition around breeding ponds at different spatial scales. We used data on the occurrence of amphibian species in a total of 655 breeding ponds. We accounted for proximity to neighbouring populations by including a connectivity index to our models. We used logistic regression and information-theoretic model selection to evaluate candidate models for each species.
   Switzerland.
   The explained deviance of each species' best models varied between 5% and 32%. Models that included interactions between a region and a landscape variable were always included in the most parsimonious models. For all species, models including region-by-landscape interactions had similar support (Akaike weights) as models that did not include interaction terms. The spatial scale at which landscape variables affected species distribution varied from 100 m to 1000 m, which was in agreement with several recent studies suggesting that land use far away from the ponds can affect pond occupancy.
   Different species are affected by different landscape variables at different spatial scales and these effects may vary geographically, resulting in a generally low transferability of distribution models across regions. We also found that connectivity seems generally more important than landscape variables. This suggests that metapopulation processes may play a more important role in species distribution than habitat characteristics.

AB The high endemism of the Mediterranean Sea provides strong motivation to develop a comprehensive plan for the conservation of its biodiversity and the management of its marine resources. Increasingly, this ecosystem-level approach calls for a comprehensive network of marine protected areas (MPAs) representative of the richness and diversity of this shared basin. Today, Mediterranean MPAs do not represent the diverse geography and habitats in the region. Despite a recent declaration on trawling restrictions in deep waters (> 1000 m), there are no true deep-sea Mediterranean MPAs. All but one (98.9%) of the 94 marine areas currently under some type of protection or management are coastal. Moreover, 69 (73.4%) are located along the basin's northern shore, highlighting the lack of MPAs in the south and east coasts. Yet, these underrepresented regions and habitats are ecologically distinctive by virtue of their particular oceanographic and biogeographic conditions. We identify several obstacles to Mediterranean MPA implementation and discuss how they can be overcome through strategic MPA network planning, contending that regional disparities in governance, institutional structures, wealth distribution, social capital, and availability of ecological data are responsible for discrepancies in the establishment and effectiveness of MPAs in this region.

AB We here employ 11 microsatellite markers and recently developed litter reconstruction methods to infer mating system parameters (i.e. polyandry and breeding-site fidelity) at a lemon shark nursery site in Marquesas Key, Florida. Four hundred and eight juvenile or subadult sharks were genotyped over eight complete breeding seasons. Using this information, we were able to infer family structure, as well as fully or partially reconstruct genotypes of 46 mothers and 163 fathers. Multiple litter reconstruction methods were used, and novel simulations helped define apparent bias and precision of at least some mating system parameters. For Marquesas Key, we find that adult female lemon sharks display high levels of polyandry (81% of all litters sampled) and stronger fidelity to the nursery site than do males. Indeed, few male sharks sired offspring from more than one litter during the course of the study. These findings were quite similar to previous results from another lemon shark nursery site (Bimini, Bahamas), suggesting conserved mating system parameters despite significant variation in early life-history traits (i.e. body size and growth) among sites. The finding of at least some site fidelity in females also supports the need for careful conservation of each nursery.

AB Evolutionary relationships are typically inferred from molecular sequence data using a statistical model of the evolutionary process. When the model accurately reflects the underlying process, probabilistic phylogenetic methods recover the correct relationships with high accuracy. There is ample evidence, however, that models commonly used today do not adequately reflect real-world evolutionary dynamics. Virtually all contemporary models assume that relatively fast-evolving sites are fast across the entire tree, whereas slower sites always evolve at relatively slower rates. Many molecular sequences, however, exhibit site-specific changes in evolutionary rates, called "heterotachy." Here we examine the accuracy of 2 phylogenetic methods for incorporating heterotachy, the mixed branch length model-which incorporates site-specific rate changes by summing likelihoods over multiple sets of branch lengths on the same tree-and the covarion model, which uses a hidden Markov process to allow sites to switch between variable and invariable as they evolve. Under a variety of simple heterogeneous simulation conditions, the mixed model was dramatically more accurate than homotachous models, which were subject to topological biases as well as biases in branch length estimates. When data were simulated with strong versions of the types of heterotachy observed in real molecular sequences, the mixed branch length model was more accurate than homotachous techniques. Analyses of empirical data sets confirmed that the mixed branch length model can improve phylogenetic accuracy under conditions that cause homotachous models to fail. In contrast, the covarion model did not improve phylogenetic accuracy compared with homotachous models and was sometimes substantially less accurate. We conclude that a mixed branch length approach, although not the solution to all phylogenetic errors, is a valuable strategy for improving the accuracy of inferred trees.

AB Carnivores are umbrella species with a key role in ecosystems. In the Mediterranean, they face with several conservation problems, mainly habitat loss or transformation. In this region, scrubland habitats are considered of minor conservation relevance as compared to mature forest formations. Conservation of scrublands in Mediterranean ecosystems is also difficult because to control fires, they are removed over large areas. For carnivores, scrublands may be essential to guarantee shelter and food. Here, we analyzed the importance of scrublands and other habitat variables in determining the richness of medium-sized carnivores in a typical Mediterranean area of central Spain (Monfrague Natural Park). The Park was divided into plots of 2 x 2 km (n = 30). In each plot, a 2 km-length survey route was walked searching for carnivore scats. We recorded the number of species of carnivores and we related this value to several habitat variables. Habitat variables were summarized by means of Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Habitat models were developed by, using multiple regression models, including PCA factors and the habitat type as predictors. The only variable included in the final model was the first PCA factor. Carnivore richness was positively associated with large tree, shrub, and rock cover areas, which is the typical habitat structure of scrublands. This habitat offers the best available area for shelter and may be considered as a key element for carnivore conservation in the Mediterranean region. To reconciliate carnivore conservation and forestry management, we proposed small-scale clearances as a management alternative to typical large scrubland removals.

AB Daily data from climate models submitted to the Fourth Assessment of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change are compared with daily data from observations over Australia by measuring the overlap of the probability density functions (PDFs). The capacity of these models to simulate maximum temperature, minimum temperature, and precipitation is assessed. The resulting skill score is then used to exclude models with relatively poor skill region by region over Australia. The remaining sample of coupled climate models is then used to determine the seasonal changes in these three variables under a high- (A2) and low- (B1) emission scenario for 2050 and 2100. The authors demonstrate that some projected phenomena, such as the projected drying over southwest Western Australia, are robust and not caused by the inclusion of some weak models in earlier assessments. Some other results, such as the projected change in the monsoon, are more consistent among the good climate models. Consistent with earlier work, a consistent pattern of mean warming is identified in the projections. The amount of warming in the 99.7th percentile is not dramatically higher than the warming in the mean. However, while the mean warming is generally least in the south, the amount of warming in the 99.7th percentile is substantially higher along the southern coast of Australia. This is due to a coupling of the temperature response with reduced rainfall, which causes drying and allows extreme maximum temperatures to increase dramatically. The authors show that, in general, the amount of rainfall is projected to change relatively little, but the frequency of rainfall decreases and the intensity of rainfall at the upper tail of the distribution increases. However, the scale of the increase in extreme rainfall is not large on the time scales analyzed here. The range in projected temperature changes among those climate models with skill in simulating the observations is at least twice as large for the 99.7th/0.3rd percentiles as for the mean. For rainfall, the range among the good models is of order 10 times greater in the 99.7th percentile than in the mean. Since the impact of changes in extremes is increasingly recognized as societally important, this result strongly limits the use of climate model data to explore sectors that are vulnerable to extremes. This suggests an evaluation strategy that focuses on model capacity to simulate whole PDFs since capacity to simulate the mean is a necessary but insufficient criterion for determining a model's value for future projection.

AB The present study aimed to assess the consequences of tectonic events and temperature regime on the diversification of Indo-West Pacific (IWP) turban shell species. Bayesian and parsimony methods were used to construct a phylogenetic hypothesis using sequence data from three genes for the turban shell genus Turbo and for a larger data set including representatives of all known genera in the subfamily Turbininae. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that all IWP Turbo species form a single clade approximately 68 Myr in age, predating the closure of the Tethys Sea and therefore predating the physical separation of the IWP from other biogeographical regions. All but one of the IWP subgenera tested in Turbo also predate the closure of the Tethys Sea. Fossil evidence for Marmarostoma, the largest subgenus, confirms that at least some Turbo lineages currently restricted to the IWP were previously more widespread. The combination of the phylogeny with the fossil evidence suggests that present day diversity in IWP Turbo is the result of the evolutionary persistence within the IWP of several, morphologically distinct lineages, some of which were more widespread in the Oligocene. Some IWP lineages show significant increases in diversification in the early Miocene, probably as a result of the increased availability of both shallow-water habitats due to tectonic plate movements and increased carbonate platforms in the central IWP resulting from coincident diversification of zooxanthellate corals. The IWP is therefore behaving as both a cradle of diversity (with new species originating in situ) and a museum of diversity (with lineages that predate its isolation also being maintained). Bayesian and parsimony analyses of the subfamily recovered five clades and mapping the temperature regime (tropical or temperate) of each species onto the molecular tree using parsimony suggested that temperate habitat is an ancestral character in at least four of the clades. This result was also supported by Bayesian reconstruction of ancestral states. Astralium (the fifth clade) may also prove to have a temperate origin, but this could not be determined with certainty given the available data. The origin of diversity in tropical regions is of particular interest because it has been suggested that the tropics are the source of many evolutionary novelties and have provided a species pool, from which temperate regions were populated. The present study suggests that Turbininae may be an exception to this rule. The tree shape also suggests that temperature has had an effect on speciation rates; temperate Turbininae are apparently evolving more slowly or suffering more extinction than their tropical sister clades, which show greater diversity.

AB Plant responses to defoliation are complex. We established a field experiment in a nine-month-old Eucalyptus globulus Labill. plantation to examine the effects of pattern (upper crown versus lower crown removal), frequency (single, double or triple defoliation within a 12-month period) and severity (25 versus 38% of leaf area removed) of defoliation and the effect of soil nitrogen (N) on photosynthetic processes and stem growth. The photosynthetic responses observed following defoliation could be attributed to changes in source:sink ratios. Light-saturated CO2 uptake (A(max)) increased with increasing severity and frequency of defoliation irrespective of defoliation pattern. Seedlings defoliated in autumn did not exhibit increases in A(max), until the following spring, whereas there was no such delay in photosynthetic responses associated with spring defoliation. Application of N before defoliation allowed trees to compensate for the effect of defoliation on stem diameter growth, which could not be explained simply in terms of increases in A(max). The observed increases in stem diameter increment following N fertilization of defoliated trees suggested increases in leaf area development, and there were changes in the leaf area:leaf dry mass ratio that may have increased light absorption by the crown. Nitrogen fertilization also increased partitioning of dry mass to branches at the expense of main stems, suggesting that N supply was important in rebuilding crowns following a defoliation event.

AB Phylogeography can inform conservation strategies through assessment of genetic diversity that incorporates an evolutionary perspective, and allows evaluation within a geographical context, thus providing integration with other biogeographical information. Comparative phylogeography can identify significant historical processes that have had major influences on the biota and provides a historical context for understanding current species distributions. The phylogeographic patterns in the flora of south-western Australia are reviewed. Concordant patterns of lineage divergence in three unrelated taxa from separate families with widespread distributions indicate a common response to major historical processes involved in Pleistocene climatic fluctuations. Identification of highly divergent haplotypes in some species indicates areas that may represent refugia during times of climatic instability. Analysis of phylogeographic patterns in the flora of south-western Australia has revealed the influence of historical climate change in promoting high phylogenetic diversity within species that is comparable to the high species diversity that is well known in the Western Australian flora. Knowledge of historical influences and species responses provides an evolutionary context for conservation management strategies that facilitate the continued action of dynamic evolutionary processes.

AB The Tibetan gazelle (Procapra picticaudata) is a threatened species and distributed on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau of China (Qinghai Province, Tibet Autonomous Region and the adjacent Gansu Province, Sichuan Province, and Xinjiang Uigur Autonomous Region). Small peripheral populations of Tibetan gazelle were once found in northern Sikkim and Ladakh, but now these are close to extinction. To describe the evolutionary history and to assess the genetic diversity within this monotypic species and population structure among different geographic locations in China, we sequenced mitochondrial DNA from the control region (CR) and cytochrome (cyt) b gene for 46 individuals from 12 geographic localities in Qinghai, Tibet, Xinjiang, Gansu, and Sichuan. A total of 25 CR haplotypes and 16 cyt b haplotypes were identified from these gazelle samples. CR haplotype diversity (0.98 +/- 0.01) and nucleotide diversity (0.08 +/- 0.009) were both high. Phylogenetic trees indicate that the Tibetan gazelle in China can be divided into three main clades: Tibet, Sichuan (SCH) and Qinghai-Arjin Shan-Kekexili (QH-ARJ-KKXL). Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) and network analysis consistently support this geographic structure in both datasets. Significant differentiation between populations argues for the presence of management units (MUs). Such differentiation may reflect a geographic separation resulting from the uplift of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau during the Late Pliocene and Pleistocene. Mismatch distribution analysis implies that Tibetan gazelle has undergone complex population changes. We suggest that the present population structure has resulted from habitat fragmentation during the recent glacial period on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and population expansion from glacial refugia after the glacial period. It is likely that the present populations of Tibetan gazelle exhibit a pattern reminiscent of several bottlenecks and expansions in the recent past. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The environmental conditions and timing of spawning of Murray cod and trout cod were investigated over three successive years in the regulated Murray River and in the nearby, unregulated Ovens River. Larvae were collected in drift samples from early November. Murray cod larvae were present for up to ten weeks, but trout cod larvae were present for only about two weeks. Cod larvae were collected in both rivers in each year sampled, despite a range of flow conditions. Spawning periods, estimated by back-calculating larval ages and egg incubation times, were in part, concurrent for the two species, beginning in October when water temperatures had exceeded 15 degrees C, allowing the occasional hybridization that has been noted between these two species. Trout cod larvae (10.0-18.2 mm) were significantly larger than Murray cod larvae (9.5-14.8 mm) in both years and the larvae of both species were significantly larger in 1995/6 than in 1994/5 in the Murray River. There was no relationship between larval size and water temperature, but later spawning times at the upper Murray River site coincided with lower water temperatures. Larval abundance varied significantly between sites, samples and years, with peak larval abundances occurring in November. Murray cod larval abundance was best explained by the explanatory variables of year, day length and change in flow over the previous 7 d. Environmental conditions for the spawning of Murray cod and trout cod are similar, and both species exhibit a similar larval dispersal strategy by emergence into the drift. Spawning occurred regularly under a range of flow conditions and it is likely that recruitment of these species in these rivers is driven by the subsequent survival of larvae and juveniles.

AB Predictive models on breeding habitat preferences of Bonelli's eagle (Hieraaetus fasciatus; Aves: Accipitridae) have been performed at four different spatial scales in Castellon province, East of Iberian Peninsula. The scales considered were: (1) nest site scale (1x1 km(2) Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) square containing the nest); (2) near nest environment (3x3 km(2) UTM square); (3) home range scale (5x5 km(2) UTM square); and (4) landscape level scale (9x9 km(2) UTM square containing the above mentioned ones). Topographic, disturbance, climatic and land use factors were measured on a geographic information system (GIS) at occupied and unoccupied UTM squares. Logistic regression was performed by means of a stepwise addition procedure. We tested whether inclusion of new subset of variables improved the models by increasing the area under the receiver operator characteristic plot. At nest site scale, only topographic factors were considered as the most parsimonious predictors. Probability of species occurrence increases with slope in craggy areas at lower altitudes. At the 3x3 km(2) scale, climate and disturbance variables were included. At home range and landscape level scales, models included climate, disturbance, topographic and land use factors. Higher temperatures in January, template ones in July, higher rainfall in June, lower altitudes and higher slope in the sample unit increase probability of occurrence of Bonelli's eagle at broadest scales. The species seems to prefer disperse forests, scrubland and agricultural areas. From our results, we consider that there is a hierarchical framework on habitat selection procedure. We suggest that it is necessary to analyse what key factors are affecting Bonelli's eagle nest-site selection at every study area to take steps to ensure appropriate conservation measures. The combination of regression modelling and GIS will become a powerful tool for biodiversity and conservation studies, taking into account that application depends on sampling design and the model assumptions of the statistical methods employed. Finally, predictive models obtained could be used for the efficient monitoring of this scarce species, to predict range expansions or identify suitable locations for reintroductions, and also to design protected areas and to help on wildlife management.

AB Asexual forms of invertebrates are relatively common. They are often more successful than their sexual progenitors. Especially in insects, the pattern called geographical parthenogenesis shows that asexuality is important in speciation and ecological adaptation. In geographical parthenogenesis the clones have a wider distribution than the sexual forms they originate from. This indicates that they have a broader niche they may utilize successfully. The cause of this apparent success is, however, hard to come by as the term asexuality covers separate phenomena that are hard to disentangle from the mode of reproduction itself. Asexual insects are often polyploid, of hybrid origin, or both and these phenomena have been argued to explain the distribution patterns better than clonality. In this study we survey the literature on arthropods with geographical parthenogenesis in an attempt to clarify what evidence there is for the different phenomena explaining the success of the clonal forms. We focus on the few species where knowledge of distribution of different ploidy levels allows for a distinction of contributions from different phenomena to be made. Our survey support that asexuality is not the only factor underlying the success of all asexuals. Evidence about the importance of a hybrid origin of the clones is found to be meagre as the origin of clones is unknown in the majority of cases. Asexuality, hybridity and polyploidy are intertwined phenomena that each and all may contribute to the success of clonal taxa. Polyploidy, however, emerges as the most parsimonious factor explaining the success of these asexual invertebrate taxa.

AB We examined the dependence of stomatal conductance on physiological properties and meteorological variables using a Jarvis-type stomatal conductance model that included a function representing leaf chlorophyll concentration as a physiological property. We sampled the leaves of 5- and 10-year-old Quercus serrata trees. A low leaf chlorophyll concentration imposed a restriction on the opening capacity of the stomata. The stomatal conductance variability depended markedly on chlorophyll function; the degree of dependence was almost equal to that on solar radiation or vapour pressure deficit. The characteristics of stomatal conductance response to meteorological or physiological changes exhibited little seasonal variation (except relative to temperature). Stomatal conductance variability depended on the following meteorological parameters in decreasing order: radiation, vapour pressure deficit, leaf temperature, and soil moisture; this order did not vary seasonally. The dependence of stomatal conductance variability on the seasonal change in chlorophyll concentration was larger in spring and autumn than in summer. These results indicate that the consideration of seasonal changes in plant physiological properties is important in evaluating the water, energy, and CO2 cycles between plants and the atmosphere.

AB Chloroplast microsatellites have been widely used in population genetic studies of conifers in recent years. However, their haplotype configurations suggest that they could have high levels of homoplasy, thus limiting the power of these molecular markers. A coalescent-based computer simulation was used to explore the influence of homoplasy on measures of genetic diversity based on chloroplast microsatellites. The conditions of the simulation were defined to fit isolated populations originating from the colonization of one single haplotype into an area left available after a glacial retreat. Simulated data were compared with empirical data available from the literature for a species of Pinus that has expanded north after the Last Glacial Maximum. In the evaluation of genetic diversity, homoplasy was found to have little influence on Nei's unbiased haplotype diversity (H-E) while Goldstein's genetic distance estimates (D-sh(2)) were much more affected. The effect of the number of chloroplast microsatellite loci for evaluation of genetic diversity is also discussed.

AB We evaluated elk (Cervus elaphus), mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus), cattle (Bos taurus), and domestic sheep (Ovis aries) diet composition, diet overlap, and forage selection on aspen (Populus tremuloides Michaux)-sagebrush (Artemisia spp. L.) summer range in northeastern Nevada to understand potential for forage competition to provide better information for managing these communities. Diets were determined through microhistological fecal analysis from 1998 to 2000, and forage selection was evaluated at feeding sites in aspen and sagebrush communities in 1999 and 2000. Elk spring diets were the most diverse in composition; summer elk diets were dominated by forbs (59%-78/(.); deer consumed mostly woody browse (64%-72%); and cattle and sheep ate mostly graminoids. Lupines (Lupinus spp. L.) constituted >= 11% of elk, deer, and sheep diets in summer. Spurred lupine (Lupinus caudatus Kellogg) was the lupine typically selected in feeding sites and greatest consumption occurred in summer when total alkaloid levels were lowest. Highest diet overlap was between cattle and sheep in 1999 (68%) and lowest between deer and cattle in 2000 (3%). Summer elk and deer diets overlapped moderately (45%-59%). Diets did not differ between elk in spring with sheep, elk in summer with deer and sheep, or cattle with sheep. Cattle foraged selectively on forbs in aspen communities (68%) and on graminoids in sagebrush communities (88%), reflecting relative forage availabilities. We detected no differences among elk, cattle, and sheep for forage selection in aspen communities. Electivity indices indicated elk preferred forbs in aspen and sagebrush communities; cattle preferred graminoids in sagebrush; and foraging sheep preferred forbs in aspen. Our results suggest potential for forage competition among ungulates on aspen-sagebrush summer range is highest for forbs in aspen communities. Monitoring productivity and use of key forage species, particularly forbs in aspen communities, should complement management objectives on shared aspen-sagebrush summer range.

AB In newly invaded communities, interspecific competition is thought to play an important role in determining the success of the invader and its impact on the native community. In southern Australia, the native Polistes humilis was the predominant social wasp prior to the arrival of the exotic Vespula germanica (Hymenoptera: Vespidae). Both species forage for similar resources (water, pulp, carbohydrate and protein prey), and concerns have arisen about potential competition between them. The aim of this study was to identify the protein foods that these wasps feed on. As many prey items are masticated by these wasps to the degree that they cannot be identified using conventional means, morphological identification was complemented by sequencing fragments of the mitochondrial 16S rRNA gene. GenBank searches using BLAST and phylogenetic analyses were used to identify prey items to at least order level. The results were used to construct complete prey inventories for the two species. These indicate that while P. humilis is restricted to feeding on lepidopteran larvae, V. germanica collects a variety of prey of invertebrate and vertebrate origin. Calculated values of prey overlap between the two species are used to discuss the implications of V. germanica impacting on P. humilis. Results obtained are compared to those gained by solely 'conventional' methods, and the advantages of using DNA-based taxonomy in ecological studies are emphasized.

AB The science of climate change has matured considerably during the past decade, both relative to the strength of the evidence documenting the ongoing anthropogenic climate change and in terms of the quality of climate models projecting future changes in climate. Concomitantly, modeling studies to project the likely impacts of climate change on agricultural production also have become more sophisticated. Nonetheless, agricultural impact assessments still do not account for all important factors; for example, potential changes in yield losses due to altered dynamics and intensity of pests (insects, plant pathogens, and weeds) under climate change are generally ignored - an important omission, given the significant role of plant pests in constraining the production of food and fiber worldwide; This paper highlights selected challenges that must be overcome before we can hope to quantify the impacts of a changing climate on plant disease intensity and yield loss. They pertain both to retrospective analyses seeking to identify fingerprints related to climate change in long-term plant-disease records, as well as to the use of mathematical models to predict likely impacts on plant pathosystems in the future. The use of climate-change fingerprints has been limited because time series containing disease variables collected in a standardized manner are unavailable for most plant pathogens; in cases where such long-term records do exist, trends are often confounded by changes in biological or management factors over time. As for the use of models for impact assessment, key challenges pertain to uncertainty in input variables, the difficulty in predicting biological responses in the presence of nonlinearities and thresholds, and the high likelihood of genetic adaptation to climate change.

AB Traffic has a considerable effect on population and community dynamics through the disruption and fragmentation of habitat and traffic mortality. This paper deals with a systematic way to acquire knowledge about the probabilities of successful road crossing by mammals and what characteristics affect this traversability. We derive a model from traffic flow theory to estimate traffic mortality in mammals related to relevant road, traffic and species characteristics. The probability of successful road crossing is determined by the pavement width of the road, traffic volume, traversing speed of the mammals and their body length. We include the traversability model in a simple two-patch population model to explore the effects of these road, traffic and species characteristics on population dynamics. Analysis of the models show that, for our parameter ranges, traffic volume and traversing speed have the largest effect on traffic mortality. The population size is especially negatively affected when roads have to be crossed during the daily movements. These predictions could be useful to determine the expected effectiveness of mitigating measures relative to the current situation. Mitigating measures might alter the road and traffic characteristics. The effects of these changes on traffic mortality and population dynamics could be analysed by calculating the number of traffic victims before and after the mitigating measures.

AB The skulls of 272 red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) and 308 Eurasian badgers (Meles meles) collected in Denmark over the last 120 years were measured to determine any temporal changes in skull size (and. by implication, body size) during the studied period. We wished to determine whether global warming had resulted in a decrease in skull and body size in accordance with Bergmann's rule. Contrary to our predictions, there were no significant negative relationships between any of the four skull characters measured and mean annual temperature. Among badgers. two of the four characters measured had increased significantly during the twentieth century (zygomatic breadth by about 2% and length of upper molar by about 3.5%). but only in Jutland. In the red fox, three of the four skull characters measured had increased significantly during the twentieth century (zygomatic breadth by about 5%, length of fourth upper premolar,9 by about 7% and diameter of canine by about 9%). with one parameter (zygomatic breadth) increasing twice as fast in Zealand as in Jutland. All the above three characters are closely associated with diet: the size of the zygomatic arch is closely related to the size of the masseter muscle. the size of the carnassial and the diameter of canine are generally associated with prey size. and the size of the first molar is associated with grinding of grain and larger invertebrates. Larger teeth enable a predator to take and handle larger prey items. However, the fourth parameter (greatest length of skull) had not increased during the studied period. Since all the above skull characters are significantly related to body size, these results indicate that the body size of both species had increased during the twentieth century. The increase in skull characters is probably related to contemporaneous changes in Danish agriculture and land use, which, in turn resulted in changes to the foxes' and badgers' diets.

AB We compared the utility of five nuclear gene segments amplified with type I sequence-tagged site (STS) primers versus the complete mitochondrial cytochrome b (cyt b) gene in resolving phylogenetic relationships within the Mustelidae, a large and ecomorphologically diverse family of mammalian carnivores. Maximum parsimony and likelihood analyses of separate and combined data sets were used to address questions regarding the levels of homoplasy, incongruence, and information content within and among loci. All loci showed limited resolution in the separate analyses because of either a low amount of informative variation ( nuclear genes) or high levels of homoplasy (cyt b). Individually or combined, the nuclear gene sequences had less homoplasy, retained more signal, and were more decisive, even though cyt b contained more potentially informative variation than all the nuclear sequences combined. We obtained a well-resolved and supported phylogeny when the nuclear sequences were combined. Maximum likelihood and Bayesian phylogenetic analyses of the total combined data (nuclear and mitochondrial DNA sequences) were able to better accommodate the high levels of homoplasy in the cyt b data than was an equally weighted maximum parsimony analysis. Furthermore, partition Bremer support analyses of the total combined tree showed that the relative support of the nuclear and mitochondrial genes differed according to whether or not the homoplasy in the cyt b gene was downweighted. Although the cyt b gene contributed phylogenetic signal for most major groupings, the nuclear gene sequences were more effective in reconstructing the deeper nodes of the combined tree in the equally weighted parsimony analysis, as judged by the variable-length bootstrap method. The total combined data supported the monophyly of the Lutrinae (otters), whereas the Melinae (badgers) and Mustelinae (weasels, martens) were both paraphyletic. The American badger, Taxidea taxus (Taxidiinae), was the most basal taxon. Because hundreds of type I STS primer sets spanning the complete genomes of the human and mouse have been published and thus represent many independently segregating loci, the potential utility of these markers for molecular systematics of mammals and other groups is enormous.

AB A model of evolution based on conflicts of interest between the sexes over mating decisions is examined in relation to diving beetles (Dytiscidae). The model predicts the following evolutionary sequence: (1) cost to females of mating increases, (2) females evolve behavioural resistance to male mating attempts, (3) males evolve devices to overcome female resistance, and (4) females evolve morphological counter-adaptations to the male devices. This model is tested using species of Dytiscidae, in which (1) some species have a very long mating duration while others mate quickly, (2) females of some species resist male mating attempts by swift and erratic swimming when seized by a male, (3) males of some species possess a grasping device in the form of sucker-shaped setae on the legs used to adhere to the pronota or elytra of females prior to mating, and (4) females of some species have a modified dorsal cuticle with irregular sculpturing which appears to interfere with the male adhesive setae. The predicted order of evolution of some of these features was tested in a cladistic analysis of 52 taxa in Dytiscidae and Hygrobiidae using characters from adult and larval morphology and a portion of the gene wingless. The combined analysis resulted in nine most parsimonious cladograms. The consensus cladogram of these indicates that male sucker setae arose a single time in a clade of Dytiscinae. Nested within this clade are five groups with an independently derived, modified dorsal cuticle in females. This pattern of characters in Dytiscinae is consistent with the prediction implied by the model of sexual selection. The utility of wingless as a marker for phylogenetic analysis of diving beetles is discussed, and the resulting phylogeny is compared with previous analyses and current classification.

AB Before sponge aquaculture is accepted as a commercially viable method of supplying bioactive metabolites, it must be demonstrated that adequate production of sponge biomass and metabolite is possible. In this study, we fanned the New Zealand Demospongiae Latrunculia wellingtonensis (Alvarez, Bergquist and Battershill) and Polymastia croceus (Kelly-Borges and Bergquist) for 9 months at two nearby locations with differing flow rates using two fanning methods: rope lines and suspended mesh arrays. The fanned explants were harvested at regular intervals over the 9 months by cutting and removing new biomass, leaving behind the original explant "core" to heal and regrow. For both species, explants grew as water temperature increased and shrunk as water temperature fell, and growth was greatest overall at the location with the greatest flow rate. Some treatments exhibited remarkable sponge growth (up to 960% in 6 months), with overall biomass yields double or greater the initial transplanted weight. Growth after harvesting was similar between harvested and nonharvested explants, indicating that healing of cut biomass and reorganization of the canal system is not a significant drain on resources. Bioactivity of fanned sponges (measure of bioactive metabolite biosynthesis) was similar or greater than found in natural populations. Both rope and mesh arrays were found to be good farming structures, but differing patterns of growth and survival indicated that the two arrays are most suited for a particular type of sponge depending on its skeletal structure.

AB Diurnal and seasonal fluctuations in the photosynthetic performance and water relations of two co-occurring Mediterranean shrubs, Erica multiflora and Globularia alypum were monitored throughout two consecutive years at Garraf Natural Park in north-east Spain. Leaf gas exchange rates, chlorophyll fluorescence and shoot water potentials were measured once each season. Leaf nitrogen and carbon concentrations, leaf delta (13) C and delta (15) N and specific leaf area (SLA) were also measured once a year (August) on well developed mature leaves. Globularia alypum experienced seasonal fluctuations in their water potential, with the lowest values recorded in summer, whereas E. multiflora did not show significant differences in water potential among seasons. Moreover, lower water potentials were found in G. alypum than in E. multiflora throughout the entire study, suggesting that the latter behaved as a drought-avoiding species, whereas the former tolerated lower water potentials. In both species, maximum leaf gas exchange rates were observed in autumn and secondarily in spring; in contrast, photosynthetic and transpiration rates reached absolute minima in summer. The stronger fluctuations in water potential and leaf gas exchange rates found in G. alypum compared to E. multiflora , suggest that G. alypum is, sensu Levitt (1980), a water spender, whereas E. multiflora is a water conservative. This hypothesis is further supported by a higher integrated water-use efficiency (higher delta(13) C values) and a higher degree of sclerophylly (lower SLA) in E. multiflora in comparison with G. alypum . Globularia alypum showed higher leaf gas exchange rates and higher predawn potential photochemical efficiency (F (v) /F (m) ) than E. multiflora during most of the study. In spring and autumn, predawn F (v) /F (m) values were within the optimal range, whereas chronic photoinhibition in summer and winter was detected in both species. However, whereas both species could maintain positive photosynthetic rates in winter, frequent negative values were found in summer, suggesting higher levels of stress during the drought period. These results together with the high correlations that were found between the net photosynthetic rates and several parameters of water availability (accumulated rainfall, soil moisture or midday water potential) provided further evidence of the key role of water availability in the regulation of the photosynthetic rates in these Mediterranean species. Warmer and drier conditions in future decades, as a consequence of climate change, may alter the present, slight competitive advantage of G. alypum and the fitness of both shrub species within semi-arid Mediterranean environments.

TI Within-generation bet hedging: a seductive explanation?
SO OIKOS
LA English
DT Article
ID NATURAL-SELECTION; OFFSPRING NUMBER; VARIANCE
AB Bet hedging occurs when a single genotype shows a variety of phenotypes in the same environment, and each phenotype is successful only when the particular circumstances to which it is adapted occur. The time scale of between-generation bet hedging ensures that all individuals with a given phenotype suffer the same fate-circumstances such as drought exert homogenous pressure on all members of a population. Under within-generation bet hedging, however, individuals with the same phenotype are subject to heterogeneous selection pressure-predation, for example, will affect some individuals but not others. An important consequence of this difference is that conditions favoring the evolution of within-generation bet hedging are very restricted. While a single lineage may realize increased fitness via within-generation bet hedging, this fitness advantage varies inversely with population size and becomes vanishingly small at even modest population sizes. Although several reviews and analyses have highlighted the differences between these two types of bet hedging, confusion persists regarding their respective definitions and evolutionary justification. Bet hedging is a seductive explanation because most students of evolution are trained to focus on costs and benefits at the individual level, and tend to seek adaptive explanations for individual traits. Although this focus is often successful, it leads us astray in the case of within-generation bet hedging. Only by assessing the fitness effects of a trait in the context of whole populations can one accurately identify traits that can and cannot be favored by within-generation bet hedging.

AB The study of Amazonian biodiversity requires detailed knowledge of the phylogenetic relationships of closely related taxa distributed across Amazonia. The Amazonian poison frogs of the genus Dendrobates have undergone many taxonomic revisions, but the phylogenetic relationships within this group remain poorly understood. Most previous classifications were based on morphology and skin toxin analyses, with limited use of DNA sequence data. Using mtDNA sequence data from four gene regions (cytochrome b, cytochrome oxidase I, 16S rRNA, and 12S rRNA), we present a molecular phylogenetic analysis of the evolutionary relationships within a representative group of Amazonian Dendrobates. We use the resulting phylogenetic hypothesis to investigate different biogeographic hypotheses concerning genetic divergence and species diversity in Amazonia. The results of the analysis support the presence of ancient paleogeographic barriers to gene flow between eastern and western Amazonia, and indicate substantial genetic divergence between species found in the northern and southern regions of western Amazonia.

AB The endangered fish species Anaecypris hispanica is restricted to eight disjunct populations in the Portuguese Guadiana drainage. The genetic structure of these populations was studied in order to determine levels of genetic variation within and among populations and suggest implications for conservation of the species. Based on five microsatellite loci. the null hypothesis of population homogeneity was tested. Tests for genetic differentiation revealed highly significant differences for pairwise comparisons between all populations. and substantial overall population subdivision (F-ST = 0.112). All sampled populations contained unique alleles. Our findings indicate marked genetic structuring and emphasise limited dispersal ability. The high levels of genetic diversity detected within and among A. hispanica Populations suggest, however. that the observed fragmentation and reduction in population size of some populations during the last two decades. has impacted little on levels of genetic variability. Data imput that most A, hispanica populations should be managed as distinct units and that each has a high conservation value containing unique genetic variation. It is argued that geographic patterns of genetic structuring indicate the existence of eight management units. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Recent studies on the determinants of distribution and abundance of animals at landscape level have emphasized the usefulness of the metapopulation approach, in which patch area and habitat connectivity have often proved to explain satisfactorily existing patch occupancy patterns. A different approach is needed to study the common situation in which suitable habitat is difficult to determine or does not occur in well-defined habitat patches. We applied a landscape ecological approach to study the determinants of distribution and abundance of the threatened clouded apollo Parnassius mnemosyne butterfly within an area of 6 km(2) of agricultural landscape in south-western Finland. The relative role of 24 environmental variables potentially affecting the distribution and abundance of the butterfly was studied using a spatial grid system with 2408 grid squares of 0.25 ha, of which 349 were occupied by the clouded apollo. Both the probability of butterfly presence and abundance in a 0.25 ha square increased with the presence of the larval host plant Corydalis solida, the cover of semi-natural grassland, the amount of solar radiation and spatial autocorrelation in butterfly occurrence. Additionally, butterfly abundance increased with overall mean patch size and decreased with maximum slope angle and wind speed. Two advantages of the employment of a spatial grid system included the avoidance of a subjective definition of suitable habitat patches and an evaluation of the relative significance of different components of habitat quality at the same time with habitat availability and connectivity. The large variation in habitat quality was influenced by the abundance of the larval host plant and adult nectar sources but also by climatological, topographical and structural factors. The application of a spatial grid system as used here has potential for a wide use in studies on landscape-level distribution and abundance patterns in species with complex habitat requirements and habitat availability patterns.

AB Genetic relations among the contents of Rubisco, soluble protein and total leaf nitrogen (N) in leaves of rice (Oryza sativa L.) were studied by quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis with a population of backcross inbred lines (BILs) of japonica Nipponbare x indica Kasalath. The ratio of Rubisco to total leaf N in leaves is the main target in improving photosynthetic N-use efficiency in plants. QTLs controlling Rubisco content were not detected near QTLs for total leaf N content. These results indicate that contents of Rubisco and total leaf N are controlled by different genetics. QTLs that controlled the ratio of Rubisco to total leaf N (CORNs) were detected. These results suggest that some mechanism(s) may be involved in determining this ratio, while the contents of Rubisco and total leaf N are controlled in other ways. In elite BILs, the ratios of Rubisco to total leaf N were higher than those of both parents. These results suggest a good possibility of improving N-use efficiency by CORNs in cultivated rice. A QTL controlling Rubisco content was mapped near a QTL for soluble protein content on chromosome 8 at 5 d after heading and on chromosome 9 at 25 d. In each chromosome region, the peaks of both QTLs overlapped accurately, giving a high possibility of pleiotropic effects by the same genes. Different QTLs controlling soluble protein or Rubisco were detected from those detected at 5 d or 25 d after heading. This suggests that these traits are genetically controlled depending on the growth stages of leaves.

AB 1 A 2-year field study examined the demographic consequences of association with shrubs in an herbaceous perennial, Cryptanthaflava. Physiological data were collected to evaluate whether shrub effects were mediated primarily through water, nutrient or light availability.
   2 Microclimatic conditions under the north side of shrubs differed from open microhabitats, primarily in light availability. Due to little photosynthetic acclimation to light, daily photosynthesis for plants under shrubs was reduced proportionally to the light regime.
   3 Shading did not reduce stomatal conductance proportionally to photosynthesis, which led to decreased water use efficiency for plants under shrubs. Few differences were found in leaf water potential between microhabitats, indicating that little competition for water was occurring.
   4 There was little evidence for shrub-induced nutrient island effects. Soil nitrogen, phosphorus and organic content did not differ between open and shrub microhabitats. Leaf nitrogen content also differed little between plants in the two microhabitats.
   5 Growth and flowering responses of individuals under shrubs were reduced relative to those in the open, even for plants located on the south side of shrubs.
   6 Over this 2-year period of average to above-average rainfall, association of C. flava with shrubs was dominated by competition for light, rather than for water or nutrients. Future investigations will address whether this asymmetric competitive interaction changes during years with below-average rainfall to a facilitative interaction, or one of increased competition for water.

AB One-year-old seedlings of Abies balsamea (L.) Mill, Picea glauca (Moench) Voss, Pinus contorta London, Betula papyrifera Marsh., Populus tremuloides Michx. and Populus balsamifera L. were transplanted in the spring, in pots, to the understory of a mixed P. tremuloides-P. balsamifera stand or to an adjacent open site. Growth and leaf characteristics were measured and photosynthetic light response curves determined in mid-August. Overall, the coniferous seedlings showed less photosynthetic plasticity in response to growth conditions than the deciduous species. Abies balsamea, P, glauca and B. papyrifera responded to the understory environment with higher leaf area ratios, and lower photosynthetic light saturation points and area-based leaf respiration relative to values for open-grown seedlings, while they matched or exceeded the height growth of open-grown seedlings. In contrast, seedlings of Pinus contorta, P, tremuloides and P. balsamifera displayed characteristics that were not conducive to survival in the understory. These characteristics included a high light saturation point acid leaf dark respiration rate in P. contorta, and lower led area variables combined with higher carbon allocation to roots in P. tremuloides and P. balsamifera. By the second growing season, all seedlings of P. tremuloides and P. balsamifera growing in the understory had died.

AB Determining the mechanisms by which natural populations are regulated is a key issue in ecology. Identifying the biological causes of density dependence has, however, proved difficult in many systems. In this study we tested whether adults of three species of reef fish (all gobies) suffered density-dependent mortality, and whether the density-dependent component of mortality was caused by predation. We used field experiments to test for density dependence in each prey species, manipulating the presence of predators and prey density in a factorial design. Prey were stocked on replicate patches of reef constructed of natural materials, with each reef receiving a different density of gobies. Predatory fishes were excluded from half of the reefs using a combination of removals and exclusion cages. Survival of the first species, Lythrypnus dalli, was high and density independent on reefs free of predators, but declined rapidly with increasing density on reefs to which predators had access. Density dependence in L. dalli was thus a result of mortality inflicted by predatory fishes. In the second species, Coryphopterus nicholsii, predators caused a large reduction in the survival in one experiment but had a negligible effect in a second experiment. More importantly, though, survival of C. nicholsii was always independent of its density, regardless of predator presence. In the final species. Coryphopterus glaucofraenum, two separate experiments showed that natural changes in adult abundance (experiment 1) and survival of stocked adults (experiment 2) were density-dependent regardless of predator presence. Both experiments thus indicated that the density-dependent component of loss in C. glaucofraenum was caused, at least in part, by an interaction other than predation. The presence, intensity, and biological cause of density-dependent survival were thus strikingly different for each of these three fishes, despite the fact that they are taxonomically closely related and ecologically similar. These findings suggest a need for further studies aimed at predicting under what circumstances different mechanisms of population regulation will operate.

AB The mating frequency of queens was estimated for eight attine ant species, Myrmicocrypta ednaella, Apterostigma mayri, Cyphomyrmex costatus, C. rimosus (four lower attines), Trachymyrmex isthmicus, Sericomyrmex amabalis, Acromyrmex octospinosus and Atta colombica (four higher attines), and correlated to colony size, worker polyethism, and sex ratio. Mating frequency was calculated from within-colony relatedness estimated by CAP-PCR DNA fingerprinting. Most queens of lower attines and T. isthmicus mated with only one male, while those of the three higher attines mated with multiple males. Mating frequency was positively correlated with colony size. Polyethism among workers was dependent on worker age in lower attines but on body size in higher attines, suggesting some correlation between mating frequency (i.e., within-colony gene diversity) and caste complexity. The sex ratio was biased toward females in species where the mating frequency equaled one, but toward males in species where the mating frequency was greater than two. Changing in nest site from ground surface to deep underground may have facilitated the evolution of large colony size in Attini, and this may have resulted in the evolution of polyandry (a queen mates with multiple males). With the evolution of polyandry in higher attines, Atta and Acromyrmex in particular have generated high genetic diversity within their colonies and complex social structures.

AB This study addresses four hypotheses that may account for differences in the number of insect herbivore species among plant species. These hypotheses are based on the assumption that insect diversity is a function of the number, quantity, and distribution of plant resources used by herbivores. The study investigated predictions that herbivore species richness will increase as a function of increasing the following: (1) host plant distribution over the landscape (host plant geographical distribution hypothesis), (2) host plant density within a habitat (resource concentration hypothesis), (3) size of individual plants (plant size hypothesis), or (4) abundance of resources (resource abundance hypothesis). We tested predictions from these hypotheses by examining the species richness of insect herbivores on five sympatric species of fabaceous plants that varied in their local dispersion of individual plants and plant architecture. Among these five species, plant geographical distribution varied threefold, density varied 38-fold, plant size and food resources available to insect herbivores varied approximate to 100-fold. Plant geographical distribution, plant size, and the resource concentration hypotheses were not corroborated in this study. Resource abundance, measured as plant dry weight, accounted for the differences in number and abundance of insect species between host plant species. Leaf biomass accounted for 44.15% of the variation in number of insect herbivore species and 51.76% of the variation in abundance of insect herbivores using leaves as resources. Flower biomass accounted for 32.86% of the variation in the number of insect herbivore species using flowers. Therefore, plants that offered a greater quantity of resources, especially leaves and flowers, had greater species richness and abundance in insect herbivores.

AB Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis (Bong.) Carr.) seedlings were supplied with solutions containing nitrogen (N) at 0.1 x or 2 x the optimum rate (low-N and high-N supply, respectively) and grown either outside in a control plot or inside open-top chambers and exposed to ambient (355 mu mol mol(-1)) or elevated (700 mu mol mol(-1)) CO2 concentration ([CO2]), Gas exchange measurements, chlorophyll determinations and nutrient analysis were made on current-year (< 1-year-old) shoots of the upper whorl after the seedlings had been growing in the [CO2] treatments for 17 months and the nutrient treatments for 6 months. Total seedling biomass and biomass allocation were assessed at the end of the experiment.
   Nutrient treatment had a significant effect on the light response curves, irrespective of [CO2] or chamber treatment; seedlings supplied with high-N rates had higher net photosynthetic rates than seedlings supplied with low-N rates. The degree of photosynthetic stimulation in response to elevated [CO2] was larger in seedlings receiving high-N rates than in seedlings receiving low-N rates. Light-saturated net photosynthesis of seedlings grown and measured in elevated [CO2] was 26% higher than that of seedlings grown and measured in ambient [CO2].
   There was no significant effect of [CO2] or chamber treatment on the COP response curves of seedlings receiving High-N supply rates. In contrast, analysis of the CO2 response curves of seedlings receiving Low-N supply rates showed acclimation to elevated [CO2]. Both maximum rate of carboxylation (V-cmax) and maximum electron transport capacity (J(max)) were lower and J(max)/V-cmax higher in seedlings in the elevated [CO2] treatment.
   There was no effect of elevated [CO2] on stomatal conductance, although it was highly dependent on foliar [N], ranging from similar to 60 mmol m(-2) s(-1) at similar to 1.5 gNm(-2) to 200 mmol m(-2) s(-1) at similar to 5 g N m-2. In the high-N and low-N treatments, foliar N concentration was 10 and 28% lower in seedlings grown in elevated [CO2] than in seedlings grown in ambient [CO2], respectively. There was no [CO2] effect on foliar phosphorus concentration (EPI)
   Chlorophyll concentration increased with increasing N supply in ail treatments. There was no significant effect of elevated [CO2] on specific leaf area. Chlorophyll concentration expressed either on an area or dry mass basis for a given foliar [N] was higher in seedlings grown in elevated [CO2] than in seedings grown in ambient [CO2].
   Elevated [CO2] increased total biomass accumulation by 37% in seedlings in the high-N treatment but had no effect in seedlings in the low-N treatment. There was a proportionally bigger allocation of biomass to roots of seedlings in the elevated [CO2] + low-N supply rate treatment compared with seedlings in other treatments. This resulted in a reduction in aboveground biomass compared with corresponding seedlings grown in ambient [CO2].

AB While stomatal closure usually limits photosynthesis during drought, our previous results suggest that drought-related decreases in foliar nitrogen concentration (N-L) limit photosynthesis during recovery from drought in prairie grasses. Here we estimate the importance of decreases in N-L to decreased photosynthetic capacity (PScap) during drought and a subsequent recovery period in three perennial C-4 prairie grasses. PScap (O-2 evolution at light and CO2 saturation) decreased 69 to 78% during drought these grasses, and full recovery of PScap required 8 to 12 days, until younger leaves were expanded or older leaves were repaired, depending on species. Decreases in N-L explained 38 to 51% of the loss of PScap during drought and accounted for 51 to 69% of the total loss of PScap integrated over the post-drought recovery period. N-related loss of PScap appeared to result more from decreases in ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (EC 4.1.1.39), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (4.1.1.31), and other soluble photosynthetic enzymes, than from decreases in thylakoid N-containing compounds. Decreases in quantum yield of O-2 evolution and F-v/F-m (variable-to-maximum fluorescence of dark-adapted leaves) during drought were small, so we assumed that little damage to photsystem II (PSII) and thylakoid membrane function occurred. Further, F-o (minimum F) decreased or remained unchanged, dark F-o was greater than light F-o, and decreases in photochemical quenching (the fraction of oxidized PSII) were reversed within 1-3 days after drought. Therefore, prolonged increases in nonphotochemical quenching (q(n); thermal dissipation of excess light energy) during and after drought were indicative of protective downregulation and were likely associated with disproportionate loss of soluble photosynthetic proteins during drought. In support of this, post-drought recovery of q(n) paralleled recovery of N-L and PScap. Thus, in C-4 prairie grasses, loss of PScap during drought is largely the result of decreases in shoot N-L and of associated protective downregulation, decreasing carbon assimilation for 1-2 weeks after drought.

AB As the partial pressure of CO2 (pCO(2)) in the atmosphere rises, photorespiratory loss of carbon in C-3 photosynthesis will diminish and the net efficiency of light-limited photosynthetic carbon uptake should rise. We tested this expectation for Indiana strawberry (Duchesnea indica) growing on a Maryland forest floor. Open-top chambers were used to elevate the pCO(2) of a forest floor habitat to 67 Pa and were paired with control chambers providing an ambient pCO(2) of 38 Pa. After 3.5 years, D. indica leaves grown and measured in the elevated pCO(2) showed a significantly greater maximum quantum efficiency of net photosynthesis (by 22%) and a lower light compensation point (by 42%) than leaves grown and measured in the control chambers. The quantum efficiency to minimize photorespiration, measured in 1% O-2, was the same for controls and plants grown at elevated pCO(2). This showed that the maximum efficiency of light-energy transduction into assimilated carbon was not altered by acclimation and that the increase in light-limited photosynthesis at elevated pCO(2) was simply a function of the decrease in photorespiration. Acclimation did decrease the ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase and light-harvesting chlorophyll protein content of the Leaf by more than 30%. These changes were associated with a decreased capacity for light-saturated, but not light-limited, photosynthesis. Even so, leaves of D. indica grown and measured at elevated pCO(2) showed greater light-saturated photosynthetic rates than leaves grown and measured at the current atmospheric pCO(2). In situ measurements under natural forest floor lighting showed large increases in leaf photosynthesis at elevated pCO(2), relative to controls, in both summer and fall. The increase in efficiency of light-limited photosynthesis with elevated pCO(2) allowed positive net photosynthetic carbon uptake on days and at locations on the forest floor that light fluxes were insufficient for positive net photosynthesis in the current atmospheric pCO(2).

AB Communities of reef fishes on 10 large isolated patch reefs or 'bommies' (108 to 267 m(2)) were monitored at 1 to 2 mo intervals over 1 yr, and then the hard corals on 5 of the bommies were physically disturbed by breaking the colonies into small pieces with a mallet. Monitoring continued for a further year after the disturbance. Coral cover at the impacted bommies decreased from similar to 66 to similar to 29 % by the end of the study, while coral cover had increased by 5 % in the same period at the control bommies. There were significant declines in species richness and total abundance of fishes on the impacted bommies, but multivariate analyses showed that the disturbance had no significant effect on spatiotemporal patterns of adult relative abundance and larval recruitment at the community level. Effects of disturbance on the abundance and species richness of 6 families and 8 distinct ecological categories of fishes were also examined. There were significant declines in the abundance of 1 family (the Chaetodontidae) and 1 ecological category (water column/substratum feeding Pomacentridae), and significant declines in the species richness of 2 families (the Apogonidae and Scaridae) and 1 ecological category (invertebrate feeders). Although coral disturbance did effect some elements of the fish communities, it appears that patterns of spatial heterogeneity in the underlying hard substrata at each bommie were also important determinants of fish community structure. Hence, historical patterns of coral growth and substrate consolidation, together with the contemporary coral community, can affect the structure of fish communities on these large patch reefs. Further studies of fish-habitat associations, together with field experiments which manipulate both the underlying substratum and the abundance of live corals, will be necessary to determine the relative importance of each of these habitat characteristics to reef fishes.

AB Photosynthesis and drought adaptation in leaves of field grown rape (Brassica napus L. cv. Global) were investigated in 1992 under temperate climatic conditions in plants grown in lysimeters in a sand and in a loam soil. Light-saturated net photosynthesis (A(max)), leaf conductance to water vapour (g(l)), leaf water potential (psi(l)), leaf osmotic potential at full turgor (psi(pi)(100)), specific leaf area (SLA), spectral reflection index (RT) used as a measure of leaf area, and leaf nitrogen content, were determined in irrigated plants and in plants exposed to soil drying.
   In the early growth stages before flowering, A(max) was 35-45 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) and g(l) was 1-1.5 mol m(-2) s(-1). Maximum rates of CO2 assimilation greater than 30 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) were obseved for up to 19 days. Stomata partly closed in ageing leaves maintaining a constant C-i/C-a ratio. Both photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency (NUE; A(max) per unit of nitrogen) and photosynthetic water use efficiency (WUE; A(max)/g(l)) were high compared with efficiencies of stems and husks and of other C-3 plants. In bracts A(max) and g(l) were 10-15 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) and 0.2-0.7 mol m(-2) s(-1), respectively. Both A(max) and g(l) varied linearly with leaf nitrogen content.
   When soil water was depleted, both psi(pi)(100) and RI decreased relative to controls on both soil types before any significant decrease in psi(l) occurred. On loam with slow soil drying SLA, g(l) and A(max) decreased before any significant decrease in psi(l) occurred. We suggest that these responses might have been triggered by a non-hydraulic signal transmitted from the roots. When water was more depleted, rape maintained positive turgor down to psi(l) of -1.6 MPa. Rape had a high TW/DW ratio (9-11) and a limited ability to adjust osmotically, Delta psi(pi)(100) being at most 0.3-0.4 MPa.

AB This paper summarizes published and original data on ecological characteristics of 103 species of Australian snakes, based on dissection of > 22,000 specimens in museum collections. Principal Component Analyses suggest that much of the interspecific variance in ecology is the result of differences in mean adult body sizes. Thus, I examine the degree to which absolute body size is correlated with other ecological variables in interspecific comparisons and investigate interspecific associations between ecological traits after the confounding effect of absolute body size is removed from the analysis. Mean adult body size is significantly correlated with measures of population structure (adult sex ratio), growth trajectories (size at maturation relative to mean adult size, and sexual size dimorphism), mating systems (presence or absence of male-male combat), reproductive biology (offspring size, clutch size, reproductive mode, and reproductive frequency in females), and food habits (proportional composition of major prey types). Phylogenetically based analyses show that some of these interspecific correlations are tbe result of phylogenetic conservatism, whereas others reflect underlying functional relationships.
   When these kinds of allometric effects are taken into account, clear patterns in interspecific variation in life-history attributes are revealed. For example, a trade-off is apparent between clutch size and offspring size: species with relatively large clutches produce relatively small offspring. Offspring size is unaffected by shifts in reproductive mode (oviparity/viviparity) but is correlated with the extent of postmaturational growth by females (in species with relatively large offspring, females delay maturation until they reach a large size). The presence or absence of male-male combat in a species affects adult sex ratio in collections (probably via sex biases in catchability), growth trajectories in males, and the degree of sexual size dimorphism.

AB In a pot experiment wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) was grown under axenic conditions in two soils differing in organic matter and phosphorus contents. The pots were separated by 30 mu m nylon nets and a 0.45 mu m membrane into five compartments, a central one for root growth, two adjacent to the central compartment for hyphal growth and two outer ones for control. The treatments consisted of sterilized Soil, supply of organic (Na-phytate) or inorganic phosphorus (P) and of soil either non-inoculated or inoculated with Glomus mosseae.
   Shoot dry weight increased by mycorrhizal inoculation in the range between 2.2 and 4.5 g pot(-1) depending on the soil and treatment. Organic P was depleted by VA-mycorrhizal hyphae throughout the hyphal compartment (15 mm). The maximum depletion was 106 mg kg(-1) soil within a 0.5 mm distance from the root surface. The depletion of organic P depended on the soil type, hyphal length density, phosphatase activities and the amount, of organic P present in the system. The maximum hyphal contribution to the hydrolysis of organic P was concentrated in the zone within 3 mm from the root surface. In the mycorrhizal treatment, shoot concentrations of P, Cu, and Zn increased. In general, a slight decrease in the Mn and Fe concentrations was noticed. A significant increase in the concentration of K in the mycorrhizal plants was observed only in the presence of organic P. Calcium and Mg concentrations were not affected by mycorrhizal inoculation.
   The results obtained clearly demonstrated that VA-mycorrhizal phosphatase is effective in the hydrolysis of Wa-phytate and confirmed the important direct contribution of VAM hyphae to plant P, Cu, and Zn nutrition.

AB Five successive greenhouse plantings of watermelon cultivars Florida Giant (susceptible to Fusarium wilt) and Crimson Sweet (moderately resistant and associated with soil suppressiveness) had different effects on the populations of Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. niveum, indigenous F. oxysporum, and various microorganism groups in the soil and on watermelon roots within four soils representing different suppressive and conducive conditions to Fusarium wilt. Pathogen populations were not affected by planting either cultivar in an induced suppressive soil developed by monoculture of Crimson Sweet or in a nonsuppressive Florida Giant monoculture soil. In a previously fallow, conducive soil and in a suppressive soil rendered conducive by microwave treatment, successive plantings of Florida Giant, but not Crimson Sweet, resulted in increasing populations of F. o. niveum. Indigenous populations of F. oxysporum showed no overall change in soil successively planted to Florida Giant, whereas planting Crimson Sweet resulted in increased populations in all field soils. Successive planting of Florida Giant also resulted in an increase in incidence of wilt, whereas planting Crimson Sweet maintained low wilt incidence throughout the study. Colonization of roots by F. o. niveum and other F. oxysporum was similar in both suppressive and nonsuppressive monoculture soils, indicating that suppression was not directly related to the degree of root colonization. Higher populations of actinomycetes, fluorescent pseudomonads, and overall bacteria occurred with successive plantings of Crimson Sweet than in nonplanted soil or most soils planted to Florida Giant. These results suggest that cultivar differences are responsible for the promotion of differences in rhizosphere microflora populations that are associated with soil suppressiveness.

AB The goal of this study was to explore how leaf and canopy level differences interact in determining total canopy productivity. Maximum rates of carbon gain and transpiration were found to be higher in leaves of the deciduous oak Quercus lobata than in the co-occurring evergreen oak Quercus agrifolia. However, the efficiency of water and nitrogen use is greater in leaves of Q. agrifolia. A biochemically based model of annual leaf photosynthesis using environmental field data indicates that the evergreen habit in Q. agrifolia partially compensates for the lower photosynthetic capacity of leaves and increases the amount of photosynthate produced per unit water or nitrogen. Simulations indicate that with low N or water availability, the evergreen species can produce canopies with greater annual production than the deciduous species; the converse is true at higher levels of resource supply. Some of the patterns of distribution of these species in northern California may be explained by examining the relationships between resource availability and estimated annual production.

AB Social structure, growth and reproductive experience of a protandrous anemonefish, Amphiprion frenatus, were investigated on a coral reef in Okinawa, Japan.  In a 67 m x 334 m study area, 24 breeding groups, 10 nonbreeding groups and 2 groups of unknown breeding experience were found around isolated sea anemones.  One group usually consisted of 2 or 3 fish.  The female in a breeding group was larger than not only her mate but also all males in other breeding groups.  The body size and gonadal state of the largest individual in a nonbreeding group were intermediate between the female and male in a breeding group.  In both breeding and nonbreeding groups, the largest fish retarded growth of the second largest.  After the disappearance or removal of females, their mates took more than 1.5 years to attain the minimum functional female size (about 75 mm in standard length).  This delayed sex change can be attributed to strong growth suppression by the female.

AB We investigated the urinary cortisol and urea nitrogen responses of mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) to winter population densities. We collected urine samples from 14 hand-reared mule deer fawns and 14 hand-reared mule deer yearlings placed in 2 pastures (66 and 169 ha) stocked with wild deer at high (133 deer/km2) and low (44 deer/km2) densities, respectively. Levels of urinary cortisol: creatinine ratios increased exponentially as winter progressed and with pasture density and were correlated with wild fawn survival in the pastures. Animals larger at the start of winter had lower cortisol: creatinine ratios during the winter. Weather conditions and date of birth for fawns, and snow depths for yearlings, exerted minor effects. Urea nitrogen:creatinine ratios declined as winter progressed and increased with cortisol levels. Rate of mass loss increased over time in fawns, was constant in yearlings, and was weakly correated to cortisol: creatinine ratios. Urine cortisol, assumed to reflect energy deficit, allows researchers to distinguish high levels of urea nitrogen caused by the availability of crude protein from those caused by muscle catabolism. By reflecting both environmental and animal condition, urine cortisol provides a tool for assessing population condition and ecological density.
